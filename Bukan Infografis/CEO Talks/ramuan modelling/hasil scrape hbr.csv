What are your boss’s “tells”? How do they engage with material? And whom do they look to for endorsement? Knowing these things ahead of time will help you react effectively to pushback and pivot when necessary while you’re in the room, either in person or virtually. Briefing a senior executive is an art and adept White House staffers do it every day under the most stressful of circumstances. They’re masters of compressing the right information into the right amount of time, no matter how complex the topic or short the briefing. The skills needed to brief the chief executive in the Oval Office are directly applicable to briefing any executive in the C-suite. There’s no shortage of advice on how to brief a senior leader: keep it short, front-load the message, and so on. These are solid pointers, but they undervalue the interpersonal elements that are critical to a successful briefing. Your presentation can fail or succeed before it begins and your odds are worse if you skimp on the personal in favor of the PowerPoint. The following tips are based on battle scars from serving twice in the White House and from years of briefing senior corporate, nonprofit, and government leaders, as well as teaching briefing skills in seminars around the country. They’re important whether the briefings take place in person or virtually. Identify the “crucial nodder.” At a critical moment in the briefing, the president will turn to a trusted advisor and look for a facial expression to affirm what you’re saying. You need that person to nod “yes.” It’s a quiet gesture that gives the boss comfort; it shows that your idea is sound and all of the right people have been consulted. Anything short of a supportive nod will invite follow-up questions and sow doubt in the room. Even worse, a look askance or a non-endorsement from a chief advisor can spell the quick death of your pitch. Before you present your idea, figure out who the crucial nodders are (it may be multiple people and it may vary based on the issue) and consult them in advance. While the executive you’re briefing may not have a crucial nodder, chances are they do have people whose opinions they trust more than others. You need their support — or at least a sense from them that you’re facing an uphill battle. Know your boss’s “tells.” If you spend a lot of time with the senior executive, then you should know the nonverbal cues that indicate things like “go deeper on that point” or “speed it up.” If not, seek out people who regularly brief and interact with them. Ask what to look for to know if the boss is annoyed and whether there’s any way to determine if it’s because of something you’re saying or if it’s unrelated. Also ask how best to respond to negative signals to try to shift the mood. Advance understanding of your boss’s body language will help you keep your cool and pivot in the right direction during the briefing. Find out how the boss engages with the material. People vary in how they react to and absorb information. A senior leader I briefed in the White House would question and push back (hard) on every point, large or small, in every briefing. Some colleagues found this intimidating and eventually turned into “yes” people and lost his respect. Other people jumped into a fight every time; they appeared closed minded and agitated him. The colleagues who earned this leader’s respect were the ones who picked their battles wisely. They went with the “yes” where they could and judiciously pushed back when it counted most, showing flexibility but also confidence in their views. If you go in with an awareness of a leader’s engagement style, you’ll be better prepared to effectively convey information and respond to pushback. Plan for gradations of success and failure. Of course, you should identify what you need from a meeting before walking in the door. But here’s a twist: Don’t think of it in binary terms of success and failure. Walk into the meeting with your “ask” but also with contingency plans for multiple scenarios of success and failure. If the conversation is trending toward “no,” you can offer a scaled-back version of your proposal. Likewise, if your idea is succeeding, have some additional ideas for add-ons or offer ways to accelerate the timetable. In short, think of how you can achieve a limited victory instead of a complete failure, keep an idea alive to fight another day, or, in the best case scenario, go bigger and faster in implementation. Read the room, not your notes. Whether the briefing is in person or virtual, you need to read cues and body language. You should know your material cold by this point so that you’re not fumbling with your notes; your mental energy should be focused on reading the room, looking for openings, and watching out for pitfalls. If there’s a corollary to this rule, it’s “take cues, not notes.” (In fact, when possible, have someone else take notes so you can be fully in the moment.) Stay laser focused on your task. Time pressure, competing interests, and unforeseen circumstances can threaten to pull you off task during the meeting, but don’t lose focus. Your ask is your priority and why you’re there, so dedicate all of your mental energy to looking for opportunities to advance it. If the conversation gets off track, a question causes the meeting to digress, or someone starts to rant about a pet topic, pre-plan several ways to redirect the conversation and get what you need. It’s a rare talent to be dogged but deft at the same time, and of course, you don’t want to look like a stiff or a robot. In a fast-paced work environment, though, meetings often get interrupted or cut short. Try not to deviate or raise unnecessary details to reduce the chance that a briefing will be interrupted before your ask is addressed. Practice the art of staying silent. You’ve floated your idea or posed your question. The discussion has taken off and now you need to be exceedingly strategic about whether and when to chime in. The executive is engaging others in the room or thinking aloud. By speaking at the wrong moment, you risk derailing the line of thought or annoying your boss. There’s no need to unnecessarily affirm something said or show off your knowledge. Alternatively, if the discussion is trending against you, take your best shot — rather than all the shots — at jumping in to try to get things back on track. Often, not speaking at the wrong time is just as important as saying the right thing at the right time. No matter how well you prepare, circumstances beyond your control, from an unrelated crisis to the boss’s stress level that day, will affect your pitch. While you cannot guarantee success, focusing on the interpersonal dynamics ahead of time and improving your situational awareness once in the room will make you more effective. You’ll be better placed to communicate the right message under pressure, whether you’re briefing the president of the United States, a C-suite executive, or any leader. Grant T.

Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. It’s your first day on the job at a new company and you are a little bit nervous. The environment is unfamiliar. You don’t know what to expect. Your main goal is to make a great a first impression, hit the ground running, and let your coworkers know you are smart, easy to work with, and a good addition to their team. When HR greets you and the other new hires, they begin with introductions. You tense up. Some people may not think it is a big deal, but for you, someone who stutters, these moments can be difficult. You count how many people are ahead of you. Two people, one person. The nerves start to rise. You are next. You stand and open your mouth, but nothing comes out. You struggle to talk, to give your name. This is not a dream you wake up from. This is real life. This is what it is like to stutter. Since the age of six, I have stuttered. There have been very few days in my life that I have not struggled to enunciate a word, complete a sentence, or communicate a thought. According to the National Institute of Deafness and Communication Disorders, stuttering is defined as a “speech disorder characterized by repetition of sounds, syllables, or words; prolongation of sounds; and interruption of speech known as blocks.” Over 70 million people in the world stutter and there is no cure. Most of the time, I am what speech pathologists call “fluent,” speaking clearly without interruptions or blocks. People who stutter can be fluent at times, and also struggle to communicate without using filler words like “uh” or “huh” at others. For me, there are moments when talking is easier and moments when talking is hard. Growing up with a stutter is an everyday challenge. As a kid, you hide it by avoiding conversations with your peers. In grade school, you keep your hand down in class for fear of being called on to answer questions that you can thoughtfully answer. In high school, you dread the presentations during history and English literature. In college, the day before you defend your thesis, you pace back and forth in your room, wearing a hole in the carpet, talking slowly and taking deep breaths to calm yourself down. We often find solace in stories about things “getting better” once you exit the tumultuous years of adolescence. I was teased throughout my adolescence and young adulthood. People snickered as I stumbled through words. But kids grow up and can learn. Some people can become kinder. You can surround yourself with adults who are educated and open-minded. Still, when the way you express yourself and communicate is different from what we are taught is “the norm,” the hurdles go beyond finding your community. The obstacles you face as you enter new phases of your life are different, not always easier. After I graduated and entered the job market, the interview became another hurdle to overcome. Sitting across the table from hiring managers, I was nervous, as are many others. Our nerves all manifest in unique ways, and for me, it was repeating the same words, talking way too fast, and starting every answer off with “Uh … ” Many people assumed I hadn’t prepared or was a bad communicator. After one particular interview, the staffing firm I was working with received the feedback, “We would not be comfortable with LeRon talking with the executives.” This is not to say that I didn’t land jobs. There were instances when I was cool and calm. I could answer questions with depth, crack a smile, and be confident. This didn’t occur regularly, though, and even still, I was isolated in those roles. I kept communication between my coworkers brief. I didn’t want them to know that I had a stutter because I didn’t want people to look at me differently, to be treated like there was something wrong with me. There were times before work when I would stand in front of a mirror and practice talking with people. Pronouncing words slow, attempting to maintain eye contact, and trying to project confidence — a lot of the same tactics people use when giving presentations. This is what people don’t usually understand. Because there is no cure, those of us with a stutter often maneuver our lives around it. Certain words we avoid and in circumstances that require us to speak in public, we don’t. For me, this made the work environment incredibly challenging. When I’m comfortable, I love talking with people, asking questions, and learning. I consider myself a social person. Connecting with others is one of my favorite things in the world. By not talking, by always carrying this fear, I was not being true to my character. I don’t know if you’ve ever had a secret, but if you have, you might know that it feels like a cage. I was putting myself in this “prison” because I was afraid. There were so many opportunities I missed and chances I passed up. My secret, not my stutter, was limiting my life. I remember the day I finally said “Enough is enough.” I wanted to participate in a discussion about race at Glide Memorial Church and share my experience as a Black man in America. I had much to add about the subject, but when I opened my mouth, I felt an almost immediate tug, asking me, “What if you start stuttering?” In that moment, I realized the biggest obstacle was myself. My mind was circling: “What if I sounded like this? What if I talked like that?” I couldn’t do it anymore. I decided it didn’t matter. I had something to contribute and my voice was a valuable one. It deserves to take up space and to be heard. I began to open up to coworkers more, forced myself to present in front of my team, raised my hand to answer and pose questions during company meetings. There were still nerves, and it wasn’t always easy, but the more I did it, the easier it became. Reenergized, I got proactive about my love of open mic poetry, got up in front of crowds, and recited my work. Sometimes I tripped over words, took a little longer to say my name, or paused when I had to finish a sentence. But I accepted this part of myself and found that, when given the chance, many others did too. As I began to share who I am with more of the world, I became a better version of him for myself. This is the story I tell now. I tell it to show people who do — and also those who do not — stutter that our handicap is a small part of who we are. It does not define us. In 2018, it was the story I told on stage, in front of a crowd of 80 people during my TEDxWilsonPark talk. I have received so many messages of encouragement since. Today I still stutter nearly every day. However, I no longer fear people’s reactions to my stammer. If it occurs while I am talking, I don’t acknowledge it, I just continue to talk. I refuse to let my handicap stop me from accomplishing my goals. I am a writer, author, speaker, and network engineer who happens to have a stutter. My life doesn’t revolve around it because I won’t allow it. LeRon L. Barton is a writer, author, and speaker based in San Francisco.

Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. Dear Ascend, How do you navigate working for a toxic leader when you can see the direct impact of their behavior on your career? For example, if you work under a leader who is going out of their way to make sure you don’t develop the skills or experience you need to apply for a more senior role; a leader who takes credit for your ideas and hides information; or a leader who is an expert manipulator, uses reverse psychology to make you feel small and is unapologetic (unless they are in public)? In other words, how do you work for a manipulative boss who is constantly gaslighting you? Sincerely,A We asked Mary Abbajay, author of Managing Up: How to Move Up, Win at Work, and Succeed with Any Type of Boss and president of Careerstone Group, LLC, to respond. Dear A, Nobody should suffer at the hands of a toxic boss. Sadly, your situation is far more common than it should be. Despite spending over $60 billion a year globally on leadership development, research shows that nearly 30% of bosses may be mildly or highly toxic. And make no mistake — bosses who manipulate and gaslight are toxic. Gaslighting is a particularly nefarious form of toxicity due to its subtle and insidious nature. While it is easy to spot toxic leaders who scream, bully, and abuse publicly, gaslighting behavior is much more covert. Gaslighters know how to fly under the radar. They are adept at undermining an employee’s self-esteem, confidence, and sense of reality in subtle, sneaky, and hard-to-prove ways. It’s often your word against theirs, which makes going to other leaders or HR difficult. To make matters worse, their manipulative behaviors — while despicable and destructive — often don’t break any specific company policies. It’s nearly impossible to thrive with a boss who actively undermines your accomplishments, diminishes your self-esteem, and blocks your opportunities. In a perfect world, you could just pack up and go. But in this imperfect and economically challenged world, you might not have the financial freedom to leave (unless you already have a new opportunity lined up). Here are some things you can do to survive — until you decide it is time to move on. Make sure it really is gaslighting. Interrogate your experience. Are you sure your boss isn’t merely a jerk? Or a poor communicator? Or just doesn’t like you or your work product? Gaslighters actively seek to manipulate and control others by making the victim question their own reality and self-worth. They lie. They deny things that they said — even in writing. They project their faults onto others, putting them in a constant mode of defense. They sow confusion. They insinuate that you are the incompetent one. In short, they weaken you in order to control you. Their need to control can stem from myriad of pathologies such as incompetence, insecurity, narcissism, jealousy, or just plain pettiness. If you determine it is in fact gaslighting, take the following measures. Document your interactions. Take notes when communicating with your boss and keep a record of your conversations. Try to have witnesses during meetings and use emails or other written documentation to recap conversations and agreements. Copy other team members on emails when appropriate. Be as clear as possible when communicating. Having a real-time record of your interactions will make it harder for your boss to question your sanity and back pedal on agreements. Doing this will also help you identify if you really are being gaslit. Protect your mental health. This is critical. Toxic bosses are emotionally poisonous, so do what you can to create distance between your mental health and their abusive behaviors. Imagine you are wearing a golden protective shield that repels your boss’s arrows whenever you feel targeted. It’s also helpful to externalize their behavior instead of ruminating on their manipulative tactics. View their words and actions as separate from you. This might look like feeling sorry for them, finding them pathetic, or even finding their insecurity ridiculous. While that may not seem “nice,” building up your own psychological health is critical to your wellbeing. Focus on reaffirming your value to yourself by reminding yourself that your boss is the dysfunctional one, not you. Engage in as many life affirming activities you can. Exercise, meditate, journal, and do things that you love that remind you of who you are, and what you value, at your core. Activate your support network. A strong support network is critical when dealing with an emotionally challenging situation. Surround yourself with friends and people who support and encourage you. Have outlets outside work for socializing and reducing stress. You might even consider talking to a coach, therapist, or other trained professional. Minimize direct contact. Do what you can to limit interacting with your boss. Avoid hallway conversations, coffees, or lunches with them that you aren’t required to attend. Invest that extra time maximizing opportunities to connect with others. A great way to neutralize the impact of a boss who blocks your success is to build relationships with different leaders at your organizations. Seek out mentors and actively look to build your network with those people who can champion your skills and talents. Confront or escalate with extreme caution. Toxic bosses don’t take confrontation well. Gaslighting is often associated with narcissistic personality disorder, so confronting them or hoping they will change may be as pointless because narcissists go to extreme lengths to preserve their ego and control over others. A gaslighter may use this confrontation to further punish you. Escalating to upper leadership or HR is difficult since gaslighting behavior is hard to prove. And frankly, chances are that a manipulative boss has covered their tracks with their boss. Before you confront or escalate, become aware of the organization’s reputation in addressing similar employee experiences. There are two ways you can do this. Ask a few trusted colleagues at work if they have any information or experience — even second-hand knowledge would be helpful. Secondly, check out sites where employees leave reviews about their employers. A company with lots of negative reviews around employee treatment probably won’t offer you much support. If you do confront your boss, have a clear game plan for what you want to achieve from that conversation. Be prepared to make effective requests for what you want and need. Inside every complaint is a request — find it and make it. If you are seeking more opportunities, find out specifically what you need to do to be considered. If you need clarification from their mixed messaging, then bring documented examples for them to review and clarify. If you feel information is being withheld from you, make a specific request for the information you need. In short, be specific about the resources and support you need to do your job, explain your rationale, and articulate how this will not only benefit you, but also your boss and the organization. For example, if you are getting mixed messages, you might say, “I want to make sure that I am on the same page as you on project X so that I can deliver great results for you and the team. I’m confused about Y and need some clarification on Z. Could you explain a bit more about that?” Be sure to repeat back what they tell you, thank them, and follow up in an email. Explore opportunities within your organization. There might be ways to escape your toxic boss without having to leave your company. Look into other positions in the company that interest you, meet with colleagues and managers in other departments, think about where your skills might translate, and make a case for your transition. While all of the strategies above will help you cope with a terrible boss, often in these cases, the best strategy is to leave (if you can). So my question back to you is: Why would you try to keep working for a boss who manipulates and gaslights? At the risk of adding stress to an already stressful situation, it’s important you have the information you need to make the most educated choice about how to move forward. Consider these unsettling facts as you ponder your options: Working for a toxic boss can make you sick. Multiple studies show the harmful emotional, psychological, and physical effects of working for a toxic boss. People who work for toxic bosses are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and other life-threatening conditions. Employees in toxic workplaces are more susceptible to chronic stress, depression, obesity, and anxiety, all of which contribute to a lowered immune system and make you more susceptible to developing physical ailments. Employees with toxic managers get sick more often and report higher levels of emotional and physical exhaustion. The longer you stay, the longer it takes to recover. It can take up to 22 months to recover physically and emotionally from a toxic boss. Mental health professionals actually liken this situation to post-traumatic stress disorder and battered spouse syndrome. As with any psychological trauma or stress, the greater and longer the exposure, the longer it takes to recover. The toxicity goes home with you. Whether you realize it or not, your stress and anxiety impact your personal life and relationships. After every talk I give on this subject, my inbox floods with people asking me to help their friend, loved one, sibling, spouse, etc., escape a toxic environment. The people who love you suffer watching you suffer. At some point you may determine that the only way to thrive is to move on. Be ready to accept that quitting could be the best solution. If your horrible boss is not going to change, take the power back. Give yourself permission to save yourself. Line up your next move and get out.

"4",4,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/working-through-the-death-of-a-colleague","communication.txt","Leadership trainings and company handbooks don’t typically prepare managers for one of the most difficult things they might experience: the unexpected death of a team member. The author, who works in cancer care, recounts the difficult challenges she faced after losing an employee — and friend — and offers advice for managers in the same shoes: 1) Be authentic with your team; 2) Remember that your plan is not everyone’s plan; 3) Communicate your grief clearly; 4) Use the buddy system when it’s time to hire a new colleague; and 5) Find a way to keep the memory alive. It’s been nearly a year since the loss of my staff member, colleague, and friend. Just three months prior to her unexpected passing, I moderated a webinar for my company, titled “Grief and Loss in the Workplace.” We shared coping mechanisms and resources with staff. We reminded them about our company’s employee assistance program and pointed them to external resources available to them for support. But coping with a colleague’s death is not something we’re coached on in leadership trainings or company handbooks. Can you ever be prepared for getting the call telling you your colleague is gone? For sharing the news with your entire staff? For cleaning out their desk, full of handwritten notes and personal reminders of your friend? As our society has entered into a reality of collective grief following a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives so far, it is even more urgent that we understand how to help one another get through loss. In sharing my experience of managing my team through grief, I hope I can help ease the process. If you are a manager or close colleague of the deceased, chances are you will find yourself — as I did — straddling the uncomfortable divide of grieving your friend and managing logistics. I was not prepared for these challenges. But in reflecting on my own experience, I’ve identified a few steps leaders can take to both manage their own emotions and help steer their organization and teams through this difficult and emotional time. Here are the most important lessons I learned in the time following a loss that deeply affected my workplace community and spirit. I work in cancer care. My colleagues and I are caregivers and survivors ourselves, so we understand the impact of death. But until the death of our colleague, my local office had remained shielded from the personal grief of losing someone we work with. We did not think we had to prepare for this type of loss. As a manager, I was the first person in my office to be notified of my staff member’s passing. Once I composed myself  —  literally, I picked myself up off a restaurant floor  —  I called the other managers in my department. We cried together. We planned. We organized a staff meeting first thing in the morning so we could notify everyone at the same time. The next day, with a prepared script from HR in hand, I told my peers that our “office mom” would not be back. But as I watched noses go red and eyes fill up with tears as my staff realized that no one would bring in English Muffins or Entenmann’s treats anymore, I went off script and sobbed through the meeting. My teammate, another manager, held my hand and sobbed with me. Grief is a natural stage of life but our society often wants to rush right through it. That day with my staff, I did the opposite. As managers and leaders, we often feel pressure to remain poised and in control when things fall apart, but sometimes we need to display vulnerability, not composure. Hold a space for your staff to express their emotions freely. By showing them that there is no shame in authentic emotion, you’re giving them a platform to experience their own processes of grieving. I gave my team the space to feel, process, and share stories that day, and I can still see how important that step has been for all of us today. As the manager of the deceased, I am the person that the family still contacts for questions, that HR requires to fill out paperwork, and that IT pesters for equipment. But while I am the point person, I have little control over the actual process. My original plan was to begin clearing her desk out after a month or so. I was going to wait to hear from her family about what they wanted to do with her belongings. I thought it should still look like her space for a while — it didn’t feel right to start removing pieces of her yet. But within days, IT requested the return of her computer. I became overwhelmed with hunting down every piece of equipment she had signed out, when all I wanted to do was lay down and cry. Within a week of the funeral service, my staff’s family members asked to come in and clear her personal items. I planned ahead to have them come in on a quiet day, when not too many people would be in the office. But my plan was not their plan — they were already on the way. They arrived with boxes and bags. They wanted to toss things that I treasured and keep things I had to shred for confidentiality purposes. Prepare your heart for the unexpected. Every person and family handles the grieving process differently. Some families may not want to come in right away, or at all. Some may ask you to ship items of importance. Some may get upset if you touch belongings. There is no right or wrong way to handle these processes, but having open communication with the family and your office leadership is essential. Remembering logistics like keys and files are helpful, but the family may not know where everything is. Be patient with them. They — like you — are doing their best. One day I came home heavy with grief and my spouse asked how my day was. I said, “I spent my day erasing my friend.” In the first month, I tried to ignore the flood of emails from HR, IT, and other departments. I wanted to say: “No, you cannot have the computer she used for years and created birthday cards on. No, you cannot have the headset she wore that scrunched down her curls. No, I will not fill out separation paperwork — because she wasn’t separated.  She was ripped from us, permanently. I lost her. We all lost her. And I didn’t want her to leave.” I felt the company was unknowingly rushing my grief. Remember that humans are (usually) understanding, but they are not mind readers. Communicate with your colleagues if you feel overwhelmed with expectations like these. When I finally explained to IT why I’d been ignoring their requests, the IT representative expressed her own feelings of grief and shared memories of working with our late staff member. During this season of loss, unexpected interactions like these helped me realize that my colleague’s graciousness had touched nearly everyone she interacted with. Her memory would not be erased. In the back of my mind I was aware that, at some point, I would have to hire someone to fill my late colleague’s role. But, how would I ever be able to replace her? Management reminded me that I didn’t need to rush my hiring process. Yet, within a week, the emails began, asking if I was ready to discuss candidates. Luckily, my supervisor has always been understanding and suggested that I bring in a colleague to help me screen candidates. I remember my supervisor asking, “If someone asks you about the current climate or culture in your office, are you prepared to discuss that?” I honestly wasn’t. And if they asked me about the previous person in the role? Again, I was not ready. I was grateful for the support of my team members during the hiring process. Nothing may really prepare you for what to say about your friend who you lost, but having a buddy during the hiring process can give you a boost of energy and support. Finding the balance of what to say and when to disclose information about the deceased is up to you. Once we brought on a new hire, I did not want to scare them off, but I did want to be honest and let them know that they had big shoes to fill. For me, it was important for our new hire to know the legacy they are now a part of. Now, it is time to honor her memory. I do not have all the answers, but my team and I are discussing ways to honor her legacy. We have already fundraised over $4,000 for her favorite charity, in partnership with one of her daughters. As we approach the one year mark of her passing, we are still considering other deserving ways to honor her. Find a way to honor your team member that best reflects the work they did and the work they would have done. Ask your staff how they want to see your team member honored. Those people who were quiet during the earlier stages of grieving may feel drawn to a project like this. My current goal is to help my staff heal and to not rush their grieving, or my own. I want everyone to know that it’s okay to be sad when you pass her desk, or see a meeting invite that still bears her name. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I spent days thinking of how my friend would have handled the frenzy that ensued. Regardless of her high risk, she would have baked my favorite cake and left it on my porch. She would have searched for the last bottles of hand sanitizer for whoever needed them. She would have offered to grocery shop for cancer survivors. It’s alright to linger in the quiet moments when you remember the sound of her voice or laugh. We do not have to feel bad for laughing at stories or pictures of her. As a team, we can keep her legacy alive by caring for the cancer survivors and volunteers who she adored.

"5",5,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/yes-virtual-presenting-is-weird","communication.txt","What is it about virtual presenting that can feel so unnerving? The lack of audience response, the inability to “read the room,” and the lack of direct eye contact all increase our anxiety. Recreating the back and forth of a conversation — even in a webinar — can help you feel more connected to your audience, which will make you sound less remote and more connected. It is easy to forget that, though you cannot see your virtual audience, they really are still there. They are listening and, now more than ever, they need your attention. While virtual presentations will never be the same as in-person interactions, it is possible to create meaningful back and forth communication that will help you feel less anxious and more connected to your audience. Recently, I worked with a CEO who told me that she dreads giving virtual presentations. “I used to enjoy getting up in front of an audience,” she explained. “I loved working the room. Now, I feel like I’m speaking into a black hole.” What is it about virtual presenting that can feel so unnerving? Surprisingly, one answer to this question can be found right outside our windows by listening to how birds communicate. Birds call out to each other primarily for survival — to signal danger and to attract a mate. Imagine how scary it must be for a bird to call out and receive no response? This is how we often feel when we present on Zoom — like the bird who calls out and hears only silence. Pre-Covid, when we presented in person, we could rely on the audience response to confirm that our message was being received. In virtual presentations, however, we lack audience feedback. We no longer see body language. We often don’t see people nodding their heads (or nodding off if they are bored) and it is much harder to make eye contact. As a result, we feel like no one is listening. Unfortunately, this makes us even more anxious about speaking. And even worse, because we feel as if no one is listening, we speak as if no one is listening. We sound less connected to the audience. We speak in more of a monotone. We ramble and have trouble finishing a thought. This only makes the problem worse — it both reinforces our anxiety and makes for a poor presentation. After all, the more disconnected we sound, the harder it is for the audience to listen. How can we solve this problem? How can we relieve our own anxiety that nobody’s listening to our virtual presentations? And more importantly, how can we help the virtual audience feel our presence and hear our message? The answer is to virtually simulate the call and response function we experience during in-person presentations. Like a bird, a virtual speaker must deliberately and compellingly issue a call and elicit a response. Fortunately, virtual platforms offer effective ways to do this. While virtual presentations will never be the same as in-person interactions, it is possible to create meaningful back and forth communication that will help you feel less anxious and more connected to your audience. Here are three ways to elicit greater audience response and connection in your virtual presentations: Use the chat, especially when you start. The hardest part of a virtual presentation is the beginning, when it feels most like nobody is listening. “Uh…is this working?” or “Can everyone hear me?” gets the presentation off to a weak start and reinforces the distance. Instead, begin with something that brings everyone in. The chat function is a great way to get immediate audience response. You could begin with a relevant question and ask people to type the answer in the chat. For example, you might ask everyone to write one thing they hope to learn from the presentation. The chat is especially helpful to introverts who may not want to speak up. Make sure to read aloud at least some of the answers (and use first names if you can). When you engage the audience immediately, you feel as though people are listening, which raises your confidence for the rest of the presentation. Even when the audience can’t respond, keep it conversational. Webinars, with their lack of audience response, can make a speaker particularly nervous. One way to simulate the back and forth nature of a conversation is to ask rhetorical questions throughout your presentation. For example, when you introduce a new idea, you might say, “Are you ready to try something new?” Or, if you want people to notice something, you might say, “Do you see the shift from low to high on the chart?” For the audience, rhetorical questions create open loops in the brain which we then want to close by answering them in our heads. This helps the audience stay active and connected to your content, even when they can’t talk to you. By continuously asking questions, you’ll feel more as though you were having a conversation, which eases some of the anxiety. Empathize. One of the reasons why giving a virtual presentation can feel so unsettling is that we find it hard to emotionally connect with the audience. By taking a few moments before a presentation to put yourself in the shoes of the listener, you will feel more emotionally connected to them when you speak. Keep in mind that it is difficult and draining to listen to a virtual presentation. What can you do to make it easier? By empathizing with your virtual audience, you shift the focus away from yourself (and what others think of you), which relieves speaking anxiety. Empathizing also helps you design a presentation that best helps your audience and serves their needs. Virtual presentations are inherently awkward. The lack of audience response, the inability to “read the room,” and the lack of direct eye contact all increases our anxiety. Recreating the back and forth of a conversation — even in a webinar — can help you feel more connected to your audience, which will make you sound less remote and more connected. It is easy to forget that, though you cannot see your virtual audience, they really are still there. They are listening, and now more than ever, they need your attention."

Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. If networking isn’t at the top of your to-do list, it should be — unless you’re Beyoncé. For those of us who aren’t Queen Bey, cultivating your network offers many benefits: greater learning opportunities, broader career prospects, access to leaders’ insights, and more immediate job options, among others. But what previously took place face-to-face in local meetups, alumni gatherings, industry conferences, and happy hours is now largely confined to video due to the global pandemic. Still, effective networking online is key for young people seeking their next role — possibly a remote job, given broader industry trends and permanent WFH announcements from major companies like Facebook and Twitter. LinkedIn may be your best shot at expanding your network while so many people are WFH. Sure, it may lack the light-hearted user experience of other social platforms, but it offers the opportunity to track trends, make meaningful connections, and maintain a curated digital resume that recruiters and potential employers can easily access and review. The problem is, while LinkedIn shows promise for early career professionals to, few are using it well — especially when it comes to outreach. If you’ve been hesitant to reach out to people on LinkedIn, or if you’ve been reaching out and not hearing back, there are strategies you can use to increase your chances. But first, let’s look at some common mistakes you might be making: Now that you’ve identified what mistakes you’re making, let’s look at how you can overcome these and flip the odds in your favor. No, there isn’t a simple playbook or shortcut. But you can cut through the noise by employing research-backed approaches such as Cialdini’s principles of persuasion and by borrowing proven practices from both regular folks and industry leaders. I recently reached out to experts, entrepreneurs, and authors who specialize in this area — from within my network and a few I wasn’t connected to — in order to learn more about formulating messages that: a) Are authentic to your personal brand b) Will resonate with recipients at any level Here’s what they told me. People aren’t employment oracles just waiting for your message soliciting their sage advice. Think deeply about the kind of guidance you want and then identify the most relevant person to approach. “Clarity is key when you’re performing cold outreach,” Cynthia Johnson, author of Platform: The Art and Science of Personal Branding, told me. “Assume that the person you’re reaching out to is busy and wants to give you the best advice possible. If you’re direct and specific as to what you’re asking and why you’re asking them, you will have created the perfect environment for a confident and thoughtful response.” Sending a vague (and all-too-common) “Can I pick your brain?” message isn’t going to be helpful. Tim Herrera, founding editor of Smarter Living at The New York Times, recommends being straightforward and transparent to improve your chances of receiving a reply. “Whatever the ask is, the best favor you can do for yourself is not to beat around the bush. You’re teeing the recipient up to give you exactly what you want because they know exactly what that is. You’ve taken away the ambiguity for them, which will save them time and mental effort, and you’re also setting up the exchange to be as productive and efficient as possible.” Of course, he added, you should always aim to be kind and courteous. Here’s an example of a note that is precise, but is flexible on timing: Erica, your professional journey really stood out to me. I’m very interested in building my career as a [role]. Since you’ve been in that position, would you have some time to offer me a bit of advice on pursuing this? I would really appreciate a brief call at your convenience. When making this kind of request, put yourself in the shoes of the receiver and try to answer this question for them up front: Why is this person contacting me? Acknowledge that you’re asking them for a favor. Here’s a persuasive and considerate one that was sent my way: Hi Kristi, you’ve built a really interesting career in thought leadership, and [mutual contact] mentioned you were a great resource as she revised her resume. Since I’m hoping to advance from [my current role], I’d love to get your brief take on my cover letter if your schedule allows it. Receiving a carefully formulated request like this is somewhat rare, as it doesn’t make any assumption that I can provide a labor-intensive line edit to someone’s application materials. Again, the acknowledgement that I’m using my time to help matters. In cases where I’ve been referred to jobseekers by other people I’ve helped, I’m even more likely to respond. If someone I help then pays it forward by assisting others in their own circles, that makes the investment worth it. (In other words: always mention a referral if you have one.) “We all have demanding schedules and are a little burned out,” explained Amber Naslund, principal content consultant at LinkedIn — a role she landed after building a consistent presence on the platform. “Open-ended messages like ‘I just wondered if you had any openings…’ aren’t useful, because all of those details are on a company’s career page and that puts the work on the person you’re asking.” According to Naslund, it’s better to ask about a specific role and see if someone is willing to introduce you to a recruiter, make an internal referral, or answer questions you have about that role, or the company. “Being respectful of people’s time, expertise, and relationships can go a long way when you’re trying to land your next job,” she told me. The professional you reach out to could, for example, be a teammate who works closely with the role in question, or the person who would be the immediate supervisor. You could try a message like this: Hi Cameron, I saw that your company is recruiting a marketing assistant. Since it seems you’d work directly with this person, it would be wonderful to hear your thoughts on the role. I’m looking to get some clarity on the role and responsibilities before I apply. Do you have a few minutes to speak with me about it in the next week or two? Before sending an invitation to connect, investigate whether or not someone might be interested in serving as a mentor. Johnson recommends looking for a leader who demonstrates that they are A) experienced in the areas in which you’re seeking mentorship and B) show signs of having some availability. Johnson found her longtime mentor on LinkedIn. “I assessed his expertise by doing diligent searches and thorough evaluations of his communications online with others.” She identified the groups he had joined on the platform, including some where she noticed that he was very active, and joined them too. “His activity told me that he was interested in discussion and possibly had a bit of extra time to work with me,” she said. “You can do this type of assessment, too, and find an amazing mentor.” When writing to a prospective mentor, make sure you’ve done your homework. Here’s an example of a message you could send: Divya, your posts on edtech in the STEM education forum have been really thought-provoking! I’ve interned for a few startups in this space and am excited about my own next steps — but I definitely could use some guidance from an experienced pro like you. Would you be open to chatting about this? In need of others’ assistance? Contextualizing your messages will make all the difference. Jobseekers should aim to strike up a conversation about their experience, what they’re looking for, and who they feel might be helpful to them, Naslund said. “It’s a great way to warm up the conversation and increase the likelihood that a new connection is willing to make some helpful introductions. People’s networks are sacrosanct; most of us have worked very hard over a number of years to gain the trust of our networks and the people we’ve worked with, so we’re not likely to open that up to just anyone and make cold introductions.” Here’s an example of what you could say to let the other person know why you’re reaching out to them: Eitan, I’m looking to join a mission-driven team like yours and just happened to see your colleague’s post about the product manager role. Would you be the right person to ask about one of the technical requirements? Let me know if I could send an email your way. According to an old Chinese proverb, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second-best time is now. So if you haven’t cultivated your network, you’d better get started. But don’t dive into a new relationship with a request straight away. Andreas Klinger, a serial entrepreneur and investor in remote-first capital, recommended playing the long game. “Plan to have long-term engagement with someone (for example in conversation via Twitter) well before you need anything. Or you can engage through content marketing — that is, sharing thoughtful articles on social that you’ve written or admire — that will capture others’ attention.” It’s worth noting that if you want to connect with Klinger, paying attention to the preferred platform counts: in his LinkedIn profile, he advises that you reach out via Twitter. Others may also indicate the best way for you to contact them, which will up your chances of hearing back. Now it’s time to get started: Put these principles into practice and tell us how it’s going. It’s understandable that reaching out to people you’ve never met might feel intimidating— and that it means facing possible rejection. Try to remember that not only is rejection normal, but it also indicates you’re aiming high enough to achieve even greater success. Growth of any kind involves some risk. The advantage: you’ll learn valuable lessons and can continually improve along the way."

Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. Several years ago, on a cold February morning, ABC News released a music video by Will.I.Am aimed at increasing the voter turnout for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. The video, “Yes We Can,” quickly went viral and became a rallying call for those supporting Barack Obama’s campaign. Two of my coworkers had very different reactions to the video. Emma, a New York-born Democrat, stepped into my office at the end of a long day and breathlessly described how she’d been listening to the song on repeat. It had inspired her to seriously consider quitting her job to campaign for Obama full-time. The next day, I saw another coworker, Logan, a Florida-born Republican, arguing passionately with Emma about the video. “It’s all editing and music,” he yelled. “Where’s the message of substance?” Emma rolled her eyes and walked away. At the time, I was shocked that a music video could produce such a strong, emotional argument between two of my peers. But as political divides across the world get more partisan, these kinds of conflicts are becoming more and more common. And if you’re just starting out in your career, it can be especially hard to navigate these conflicts. Maybe you haven’t had to have a serious conversation at work yet, or you’re just starting to feel comfortable at a new job. You may have even had disagreements with your coworkers over tasks, how you should respond to a client, or what next steps to take in a project. But at the end of the day, work is work, and it’s usually not personal. Political conflicts, on the other hand, are personal. They tend to challenge our values and upset our sense of emotional balance. You’ve likely heard the expressions: “The enemy of my enemy is my friend,” or “A friend of my friend is a friend.” These sayings are drawn from balance theory, which explains how mutual agreement on feelings, attitudes, and beliefs can lead to the formation of positive relationships. But the expression “a friend of my friend is a friend” doesn’t just apply to other people, it applies to social objects — like values — as well. For example, if you strongly identify as a Democrat, you may find that many of your friends are Democrats too, and vice versa. So if you find out that a coworker that you like disagrees with one of your strongly identified values, it causes a great deal of emotional tension. We know from studies of social relationships that we resolve this tension in one of two ways — either we change our values, or we change our relationships. Neither of those outcomes are desirable in the workplace, because you have to be able to work well with all kinds of people despite divergent beliefs. Assuming that we want to hold onto our core values at work and maintain good working relationships, what can we do? The answer is surprisingly simple: Have a conversation. It won’t always be easy, but rest assured, there are ways to gracefully navigate a debate about politics at work. 1) Start by listening. When our values are challenged, it is hard to resist the urge to speak out and “correct” others’ views. However, a more productive approach is to start by listening to your coworker. I don’t just mean wait for them to finish talking before you share your point of view. I mean fully exploring their point of view. Ask open questions (i.e., those that start with how, what, why). It is important to express interest, so try using phrases like: When you have explored their view, summarize what you’ve heard to check that you’ve understood them correctly. The idea here is to paraphrase what they said, not to necessarily agree with them (e.g., “Let me see if I understand. You believe…”). Listening, of course, is hard to do when your values are challenged, but taking this approach sets the tone for the rest of the conversation. By listening, you send the message that their view is valid (even if you don’t agree with it), and you build a norm for interacting that will encourage them to listen and explore your point of view in return. 2) Re-frame the issues that are important to you. Now that you’ve really listened to your coworker, you hopefully understand their values. This is essential if you ever want to change their point of view (if that is your goal). When we try to convince other people of our ideas, we often frame our arguments through the lens of our own values. But when people don’t share our beliefs, they won’t be convinced by arguments built on them. Research shows that when partisan issues are re-framed through values that opposing groups care about, those groups increase their support. This approach can work for you too. For example, Democrats and Republicans frequently disagree on military spending. Republicans have traditionally advocated for the expansion of the military, arguing that the military unifies American society and ensures the U.S. maintains its standing on the world stage. Democrats tend to disagree, seeing this justification as overly hawkish. Yet when military spending is framed as providing opportunities for social mobility for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, Democrats increase their support for military spending. 3) End on agreement. Now that you have re-framed the issue through the lens of each other’s values, explore any areas of agreement you share. For example, you might both agree that access to health care should be expanded (even if you disagree on how) and that any candidate for political office who intends to reduce access to health care is unlikely to receive either of your votes. Again, simple phrases like “It sounds like we agree on …” or “The overlap between our views is …” are all that are needed. Ending on agreement is important for restoring the sense of emotional balance you feel towards the other person and de-escalating any emotional tension between you. It is unlikely you will leave the conversation having resolved all of your differences. But by finding some point of agreement, you will leave the talk on a common ground and leave room for another collaborative conversation in the future. Remember that there is also a caveat here: Different types of political conversations can happen in the workplace. The types of conversations I’ve outlined above may make us upset and angry, but they don’t threaten our existence or comfort at work. However, other conversations can become hostile or disrespectful to you or your BIPOC or LGBTQIA colleagues. If that is the case, you should initiate a conversation with your manager or HR. On the whole, diversity of values, thought, and opinion is an essential part of today’s workplace. Engaging with people who hold deeply different views than us can spark new ideas and insights. But this potential is lost when diversity of values breeds misunderstanding and conflict. Ultimately, the responsibility for forging productive working relationships with people with different values falls to the individual, and it starts with a conversation. Raina Brands, Ph.D, is an assistant professor of organizational behavior at London Business School. She is an expert in social networks and how these informal workplace relationships can present hidden barriers to performance, attainment, and collaboration. A core focus of her research is to understand how social networks shape women’s careers and to directly intervene in these processes to create more meritocratic organizations."
"8",8,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/ascend-in-praise-of-disagreeing-more-at-work","communication.txt","Disagreements are not necessarily a bad thing. However, it can be difficult to disagree with someone with more experience than you, especially when you’re in the early stages of your career. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. What’s your first reaction when you don’t agree with what your manager is saying? You might imagine everything that could go horribly wrong if you pushed back. When you’re young and in the early stages of your career, disagreeing with someone more experienced than you can be incredibly difficult. Years ago, I faced a situation like this in one of my first roles as a project manager. I had a client (let’s call him Jon) who I thought was difficult. During our weekly catch-ups, he’d come with a whole list of things for me to do for the following week. He’d even create schedules for me. Most times, I didn’t quite agree with how he wanted me to go about things or the order in which he wanted me to do them. I knew that if I tackled similar tasks together, I’d be more efficient and quicker. But being new to the workforce and conflict averse, I thought it best to remain quiet and follow the rules: The client is always right. Week after week, Jon and I would discuss progress, upcoming projects, and the weather — everything except the elephant in the room. There were many times that I thought about quitting. Because I believed it was impossible to disagree without getting into an argument, I continued to dwell in misery. I was never able to check things off my to-do list, buried under a pile of work that had no expiration date. After six months of working tirelessly with Jon, I decided to do something about it. One day, during our weekly call, I summoned up the courage and let the cat out of the bag. “I think there is a better way to do this, Jon. Would you mind me suggesting?” There was an awkward silence for about 30 seconds, and then he spoke. “I’d love to hear it!” He seemed excited. “I thought you didn’t have an opinion on this. Ideas are always welcome.” That’s when I realized that Jon had probably been under the impression that I had never spoken up because, maybe, I didn’t have an opinion about our work. Jon wasn’t being difficult. He was just taking charge of things because he thought I wouldn’t. The projects usually had a tight deadline, and we had to keep the ball rolling. Someone had to take the lead. “I’ve always liked the quality of your work and I know that you’re capable, but you never come forth with ideas or alternate ways,” he said. “It’s always made me think that you’re not interested in working with me or the projects we work on. To me, it was the final output that mattered, and time was of essence, so I never prodded.” That hit me hard. From that day on, we always discussed the pros and cons of how we were going to execute a task — within budget and on time. Not only did it lead us to have a great working relationship, the discussions (sometimes even heated, but respectful) lead to us figuring out the best solutions. If you find yourself in a similar situation, here are some tactics that have worked for me over the years: Ask more questions: When you don’t agree with something, don’t immediately accept it. This can be hard when you’re just starting out or if you’re entering a new role. But if you ask respectfully — with curiosity and positive intent — you will likely be rewarded, not punished. By probing and discussing things, you will not only figure out what matters to the people on your team (as I did with my client), but also how they prefer to work. In my case, it only got easier with every new project because I had understood how to respond to Jon’s requests and proactively suggest ways of doing things that were the sweet spot for both him and me. Use it as an opportunity to learn: When you disagree, you come out the other side learning a new way to do something, which could sometimes be better and more efficient. Disagreements also help you think creatively. With the little experience you have, it’s not possible to have an answer to everything right away. By discussing the situation, listening intently, and finding the best possible solution, you gain an opportunity to think critically and challenge your own assumptions, which helps you learn and grow. I remember how Jon would invariably suggest something I hadn’t thought of (or wasn’t in a capacity to think of) and instead of simply agreeing with him, I would rack my brain to outsmart his suggestions and think of an even better way of completing a task. I didn’t always come up with a brilliant solution, but I learnt how to push my limits and think creatively. Use it to hone your negotiation skills: Think about it this way: When you disagree with someone or something, you’re really negotiating. Successful negotiations are all about reaching a probable, mutually beneficial outcome. You’re trying to influence the other person to understand your point of view, and you’re trying to understand what matters to them. The back-and forth with Jon helped me understand his style of working and his priorities better, and it helped me learn how to respect views that were different from mine. We would leave the discussions feeling heard. In the end, it boiled down to knowing that the solution we were following through on was in both of our interests. Disagreeing with someone is not about getting into a fight or about unkindness. It’s about how difference of opinions can lead to better work outcomes. So don’t assume that a disagreements always lead to damaged relations. As long as you show respect to the other person, while safeguarding your self respect, disagreements can fuel better work relations and performance."
"9",9,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/successful-remote-teams-communicate-in-bursts","communication.txt","For remote teams, remote communication is both a challenge and a priority — and it will remain so long after the present pandemic has ended. The authors present new research that suggests remote communication is most effective when teams coordinate to communicate in rapid-fire bursts, followed by periods of uninterrupted “deep work time”; when they exchange a broad diversity of information; and when they align their schedules to communicate synchronously rather than asynchronously. With the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing, the move to an online workplace has become widespread and may well endure. But, as many organizations are learning, managing the flow of communication among remote teams is tricky. Our latest research findings have led to insights that can help. They center on the concepts of burstiness, information diversity, and physiological synchrony, attention to which can foster creativity, streamline processes, reduce the stress of multi-tasking, and improve team performance. Human communication is naturally “bursty,” in that it involves periods of high activity followed by periods of little to none. Our research suggests that such bursts of rapid-fire communications, with longer periods of silence in between, are hallmarks of successful teams. Those silent periods are when team members often form and develop their ideas — deep work that may generate the next steps in a project or the solution to a challenge faced by the group.  Bursts, in turn, help to focus energy, develop ideas, and achieve closure on specific questions, thus enabling team members to move on to the next challenge. To communicate in a bursty manner, members of a team should avoid thinking of message-based communication, like email and texting, as asynchronous, with everyone simply sending messages to one another whenever they feel like it. Instead, they should align their work routines and then communicate in short periods when everybody can respond rapidly and attentively. That’s the route to higher performance. To facilitate burstiness, you have to find time when team members can actually focus on individual task work. This can be challenging if they are also managing childcare and home-schooling, or caring for other family members, and may not have access to dedicated workspace. Some teams have managed to find flexibility and common times very early or late in the day. Coordinating this can be complicated and stressful, but figuring out when teams can be bursty together can help smooth out the jagged edges of our Covid-induced remote-work constraints. How can managers best create environments that foster bursts of activity? The old-fashioned way to do this would be to schedule blocks of time when people are open for meetings, and then do a burst of back and forth communication during those blocks. Newer technology can help facilitate opportunities to synch up with others more organically by allowing people to signal if they are busy or available at different times during the workday. Calendar technology can allow collaborators to see if someone is in a scheduled meeting and thus not available. Other technology makes it possible to track activity patterns in documents or on work-related websites, which can help make clear when people are available for an interruption. Such tracking can allow organizations to identify good times for nudging team members to be more bursty. Additional tools, such as a new one called Minglr, which our team has worked on, can enable ad-hoc video chat that does not require pre-scheduled meetings or the need to send Zoom invitations. Organizations can also focus on defining “deep work” times and then can reserve other time slots for bursty interactions. Our research has shown that well-coordinated groups fall naturally into these patterns, and that encouraging such behaviors leads to better outcomes than mandating them. For example, if team members recognize that they tend to be more responsive to one another at certain times, it’s best if they start to shift their schedules and focus on their shared work at those times so that they can then iterate quickly on tasks. Managers and teams should work to find new ways to develop awareness for and amplify those cues so that everybody on the team knows when others are available. The bottom line: Worry less about sparking creativity and connection through watercooler-style interactions in the physical world, and focus more on facilitating bursty communication. The diversity of information we communicate is critical for effective communication. Diversity in teams also plays an important role, because it facilitates the exchange of a greater diversity of information, which in turn boosts team performance. Our research suggests that each piece of communication should focus on a small set of topics, because that creates more information diversity across messages. Small chunks of information help focus the mind and declutter communications. Have you ever tried to manage multiple emails from your teammates that span an entire globe of topics? In that situation, it’s dangerously easy to become lost in searching for information, or just to get distracted from what’s actually the most important topic of the moment. To optimize information diversity, strive to make each message as focused as possible. Instead of sending one long email that covers three topics, for example, send three separate ones. The fewer the number of ideas involved in a given message, the easier it is to go into more depth and have a back-and-forth exchange about each one. All that said, our work suggests that there’s a tradeoff involved between diversity and burstiness. Information diversity matters most if you aren’t engaged in bursty communication, and vice versa. Physiological synchrony also matters. Our work suggests, for example, that video conferencing is not always beneficial for effective communication. That might seem counterintuitive, but it turns out that video conferences can disrupt the non-verbal cues that enhance collaboration and collective intelligence. When we meet and work together in person, visual synchrony — notably, facial expression — commingles with vocal synchrony, which leads to harmonized interpersonal communication. That’s how people know when it’s appropriate to speak without interrupting, or how a group understands it has collectively agreed to a solution. In our research on remote communication, we’ve found that not having access to visual cues, as is the case in audio-only calls, actually increases equality in speaking time. This positively affects collective intelligence. Adding video to these calls, we found, reduces equality in speaking time — and thus collective intelligence. In many cases, what this means is that audio-only remote meetings can be more effective. The key point from our findings is simple, if surprising: It’s often a good idea to prioritize audio over video. Task-focused conversations, in particular, are generally better when conducted by audio, with participants simultaneously focusing on a document or a whiteboard that captures and displays their work. Conversations involving subtle emotional nuance are likely to be different, however. In such situations, visual cues can be very helpful. And there are still times and places for ad-hoc interactions around the virtual watercooler, as long as a smooth and reliable video connection is possible. At these times, teams can synchronize through facial expression and voice to convey such fundamental human qualities as shared attention and empathy. Our research on effective communication in remote teams started years before the pandemic, and the insights that have emerged from our work will prove useful regardless of when and how we return to the office. Whenever teams are apart physically in work settings, managers should work to develop burstiness, foster information diversity, establish periods of deep work without interruption, and tailor the use of audio and video technologies to meet the needs of particular interactions.

Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. The first time I was able to vote in a presidential election was in 2012. I remember eagerly watching Barack Obama and Mitt Romney battle it out on the tiny TV in my dorm room as I yelled at my roommates to come watch with me. They, of course, made the debate into a drinking game. But at least I got them to watch. Their apathy didn’t really bother me at the time. As a journalism and political science major, I understood that very few of my friends were as interested in politics as I was. And I accepted that some of them would vote in the election, and others would choose not to. The 2016 election was similar. I heard from a lot of friends that they didn’t like either major party candidate, so they wouldn’t be going to the polls. Those friends of mine were in the majority. In the 2016 presidential election, more than half of Americans ages 18 to 29 didn’t vote. In total, only 60% of eligible voters cast a ballot (and that was record turnout). There are a lot of reasons people don’t vote. Yes, apathy is one of them, but there are many other barriers. There are student voting restrictions, confusing registration rules, long lines at polling centers, voter purges. Some people simply can’t afford to take time off from work to vote. This year is no different. Except now, during a global pandemic, we also have to worry about our health and safety at the polls. Despite the outpour of voting resources I’m sure you’ve seen on social media and beyond, you may still encounter friends, coworkers, or family members who say they won’t be voting. I want you to be armed with what I wasn’t: some words of wisdom about why it’s important to vote. We asked a few of our readers and friends for their advice: What would you do if someone told you they’re not voting this year? “Oftentimes nonvoters stay home because they feel that their concerns are ignored and unrepresented by the presidential candidates and the people around them; the last thing you would want to do is voter shame or further ignore their concerns. Having even one positive interpersonal experience can go a long way when discussing the election. And, more often than not, just taking the time to listen to someone else is enough to make them reconsider their positions. If you are reading this and if you have doubts about the efficacy of your vote, that is completely understandable. I humbly leave you with the suggestion that even if you believe that your ballot won’t directly improve your own life, it can positively affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of others.”— Jerry, 27, Philadelphia, PA “I’d listen. People have all sorts of reasons for not voting. Some reasons are more valid to me than others, but I think it’s important to understand why, so we can all work towards a democracy that people want to participate in; with equal access and representation. A democracy that makes people feel heard and makes them excited to vote.”— Bryn, 31, Louisville, KY “I think the conversation would go something like this: *blank stare* ‘Wait so….WHY? Actually, it doesn’t really matter what your reason is, if you don’t vote, we can’t be friends. In a world where we have so little control over our government/country/WORLD, how could you not do that one little thing that we CAN do? If you aren’t going to do it for you, then do it for someone else. Your parents, a sibling, a friend, YOUR DOG. Voting is so much more about the big picture than just the present and the candidates that we either love or hate. It’s about what kind of place you want this country to be in the future. This is about more than just the qualities of each candidate, it’s about moving closer to whatever your version of ideal is for this country.’”— Michala, 23, New York, NY “Vote because it’s a privilege to live in a democracy and a right that comes with being in one. Vote for the disenfranchised and marginalized, vote for empathy and justice, vote to better the status quo, vote to protect our democracy.”— Joyce, 23, Los Angeles, CA “I would first ask them why they are not voting to find out where their conflict is. There are a multitude of concerns that are valid when it comes to voting, ranging from individual issues like voter suppression tactics in their state that make voting torturously difficult, to system-level issues like how casting a ballot keeps our colonialist government in power over land that belongs to Indigenous peoples. I would want to hear my friend’s thoughts about these topics so I could support and grow with them. Once I discussed these issues, I would talk to them about how we can vote AND what actions we can do together beyond the election to fix those concerns. Voting is only one tool for working towards the future we want.”— Shoshana, 31, Philadelphia, PA “I would say, ‘I’m extremely disappointed in your decision to abstain from the 2020 election. Clearly you don’t care what’s at stake regardless of recent events regarding race, health, and the stability of this democracy. You have not done the work to understand the privilege that protects you from the current administration. Your decision was character defining, so I’d like to reevaluate our friendship.’”— Anonymous, 25, Louisville, Kentucky “If a friend or coworker told me that they were not going to vote in the election, I would ask them why. Ultimately, I would try to convince them to vote. However, the key to the conversation is understanding their motivation to not vote. Is it because they are worried about getting sick at the polls? Let’s discuss safety measures. Is it because they don’t understand how to fill out an absentee ballot? Let me show you how. Is it because they don’t think their vote counts? Then let’s talk about how much it does and how important it is to exercise this right that many in the world don’t have, and that so many in our country fought and died to obtain for every American citizen. Politics aside, whatever the reason you don’t want to vote, let’s have a discussion about it, because we should not take this right for granted. Every voice has a right to be heard; that is what our country was founded on.”— Angela, 36, Columbus, OH"

Mothers are more likely to do most of the household labor, childcare, and home-schooling coordination, spending as much as 20 hours a week more compared to co-working fathers. They may be less visible and less available to their colleagues, and more likely to be passed up for stretch assignments or promotion due to gendered assumptions that they’re “too busy” at home. Men must step up and be active allies to women during this time of remote work. First, include and sponsor women. Second, ensure women’s voices are heard in meetings, passing the mic to them when you can. Third, practice transparency by sharing information and processes that are hidden from women. Finally, evenly distribute virtual office housework, like note taking and committee work, and encourage women to say “no” more often. Everyday gender biases and barriers remain a persistent problem in office culture. But men with a keen awareness of how women experience the workplace and how gender inequities torpedo profitability and mission outcomes can actively deploy strategies to overcome them. In the in-person work environment, these strategies include ensuring that women have a seat (and a nameplate) at the table; confronting other men when they make biased or sexist statements, including to women in team social events; and validating and normalizing women’s experiences in the moment. Men now have to adapt these strategies for the remote workplace. Consider the obstacles working women are dealing with during the Covid-19 pandemic. Remote work has exacerbated previous gender inequities at home, which in turn has had ramifications in the workplace. Mothers are more likely to do most of the household labor, childcare, and home schooling, spending as much as 20 hours a week more compared to co-working fathers. Women report feeling they need to be “always on,” concerned that their job performance will be negatively evaluated, and unable to confide in colleagues about remote-work challenges. All of this leads to increased stress, burnout, job uncertainty, and financial insecurity. Of notable concern, one in four women are considering downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce altogether because of the strains that working remotely during the pandemic has put on them. Given their added domestic burdens, and the persistent motherhood penalty for women with children, women currently face more headwinds than men in the workplace. For instance, because of demands from children and ambient noise at home, they have to mute themselves on video calls, making themselves appear less visible and less available. Because of gendered assumptions about their too burdened at home to consider a new stretch assignment or promotion, they can also be stymied in their career advancement. World-class ally-ship at this moment requires an astute understanding of how and why women are uniquely affected in the remote environment, and the motivation to adapt key ally actions to the work-from-home world. Here are four strategies that male allies can deploy now to empower women and stem the loss of talented women from the workforce. Include and sponsor women. Women in male-centric environments can experience belonging uncertainty even in normal work conditions. Many women receive subtle — or sometimes overt — signals that they are not part of the team, and that no one has their backs. Because women’s conceptions of themselves often are highly defined by interpersonal relationships, such exclusion experiences can cause loneliness and attrition from the workplace. Diminished face time during remote work may exacerbate this sense of isolation and create uncertainty about advancement opportunities among female colleagues. Share your time generously with the women you work with. Reach out and inquire how they are faring in the remote-work situation. Invite conversation, check in often, and get back to them quickly when they reach out with questions or issues. Instead of an open-door policy, have an “open-phone/video-conference” policy, making it clear you’re available for impromptu conversations. Be purposeful, too, in your sponsorship and advocacy. Recent research shows that only 23% of senior men are sponsoring women while in the remote-work environment. Even fewer are sponsoring women of color. With more women considering leaving the workforce, more men need to talk about the great work women are doing and the excellent results they are producing, to overtly reinforce their value to the organization. Ensure women’s voices are heard in meetings. Be aware of the tendency for men to dominate conversations in virtual meetings, pitches to clients, formal presentations, and everyday discussions. Some women are socialized from an early age to hold back until there is a clear break in the conversation, which can be even more challenging in the remote-work environment. Others have been spoken over so often on a call or Zoom meeting that they’ve simply quit trying. In virtual meetings, we tend to reward the fastest and loudest participants (often men) and don’t deliberately make space for other voices. Next time you are in a virtual meeting, look for an opportunity to toss the conversation over to a woman on your team and acknowledge her as an expert in a given topic: “Anyway, that’s my two cents, but Mary has way more experience in this area than I do. What do you think, Mary?” Or, notice when a talented woman hasn’t contributed to the conversation and ask her a specific question to pull her voice in: “I know Patrice has done work in this area before. I’d love to hear your thoughts, Patrice,” or “You always have such interesting perspectives on these questions, Tanya. I’m really curious what your take is.” Be authentic and say it because you mean it. Practice transparency. Male allies pull back the curtain on information and processes that often are hidden from women. Because we communicate less during remote work, it’s easier for women, in particular, to miss important information and decisions that affect their jobs. During the pandemic, key business decisions to close or reopen physical offices and manufacturing facilities, changes to remote work policies, domestic and international travel plans, and knee-jerk paid leave policy changes have left employees feeling anxious and dissatisfied. The nature of remote work requires a deliberate communication plan to provide regular (and more frequent) updates on key business and personnel decisions, and the company’s status. When intel is less accessible to women, whether it concerns pay, benefits, flex-work arrangements, or promotion opportunities, this perpetuates gender inequities in the workplace. If such intel is being transmitted in private conversations, emails, and video gatherings, be sure to pass it along to women who are not on the invite list. More broadly, consider how this information could be discussed in open settings such as virtual town halls, Zoom meetings, virtual lunches, online fireside chats, and webinars. Evenly distribute virtual office housework. Recent research shows that women volunteer for non-promotable tasks more than men and are far more likely to be directly asked to take them on. While some of the common office housework — getting the coffee or planning the social gathering — has evaporated, be attuned to who gets assigned committee work, note-taking, the planning and organizing of virtual events, tracking of administrative requirements, and the leading of employee-resource groups. Say something when office housework is regularly directed to a female colleague, or volunteer to do it yourself. Work to develop a fair and equitable approach to distributing mundane virtual meeting chores and annoying administrative duties that detract from more career-enhancing activities. Maybe, for both men and women, it’s a simple rotational schedule that fairly determines who takes notes, monitors time, or produces the next meeting agenda. Also, encourage the women you work with to say “no” more often. Consider having a collegial conversation over a Zoom coffee break with women who seem to be raising their hand too often for virtual housework. Tell them what you’re noticing, talk about the career-progression ramifications, and encourage them to be selective and practice saying “no,” even if it feels uncomfortable. Then, have their backs when they decline one of these non-promotable “opportunities.” Leaders and managers —and the majority of men in most industries — are at a crossroads. We must decide to take personal action to evolve and improve ally-ship behaviors in remote workplaces so that talented women are retained and advanced. Anything short of this commitment will undermine recent gains in gender diversity. To achieve gender equity as we continue to live through this pandemic, the first step is to cultivate an awareness and understanding of the unique remote-work challenges that women confront now on a daily basis."
"12",12,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/managing-a-team-with-conflicting-political-views","communication.txt","The U.S. is experiencing one of the most divisive elections in history and it’s impossible for the topic not to enter into our everyday conversations—including those that happen at work. When people on your team have opposing views, those exchanges can get tense. As a manager, how should you handle it? It may be tempting to make your workplace a politics-free zone in the interest of team cohesion, but banning political talk is impractical, counterproductive, and hurts team culture more than it builds it. Instead, you need to set a good example for how colleagues relate to one another. Model inclusivity; demonstrate respect for others; and show a willingness to challenge your assumptions. Remind people of the team’s resilience, compassion, and its embrace of diverse opinions. Even in a poisonous political atmosphere, it’s possible for people from opposite sides of the spectrum to have positive, productive, and relationship-enhancing conversations. Politics around the world seem to be getting more and more divisive, and it’s impossible for the topic not to enter into our everyday conversations — including those that happen at work. When people on your team have differing views, those conversations can often get tense. As a manager, what should you do? Should you ban political talk? What sort of ground rules can you lay down for these conversations? And how can you make sure you don’t harbor grudges against colleagues who don’t share your beliefs? In a typical election years, managing a team with opposing political views is not easy or straightforward. But this polarized, pandemic-weary period has made the task even more complicated, says Tina Opie, associate professor in the management division at Babson College. In the U.S., the high-stakes presidential race, combined with the Covid-19 health emergency and continued social unrest over racial injustice, is “affecting employees as people, and it’s also affecting how they show up at work,” she says. Even the most dedicated workers may find it difficult to compartmentalize their jobs from what’s happening in the political arena. “It’s on their minds, and since people spend the majority of their waking hours with their colleagues,” it’s inevitable that it will seep into their everyday conversations, Opie says. Your challenge as a manager is to make sure that as passions run high and viewpoints clash, the workplace remains respectful and productive, says Emily Gregory, a vice president at VitalSmarts, the leadership training company. “A manager’s job is to create an environment where people feel safe to contribute their ideas and experiences,” she says. Here is some advice on how to do that. Leading a team of people with dissimilar political stripes requires a “robust understanding and appreciation of different perspectives,” says Opie. In that way, it’s similar to managing a team comprised of employees from different cultures, races, genders, and backgrounds. Party allegiance is another element of diversity. A certain degree of conflict may be unavoidable, but it doesn’t have to be uncivilized. You set the right tone and tenor for how your team members relate to one another. Gregory recommends laying the groundwork during meetings by modeling inclusivity, encouraging divergent views, demonstrating respect for others, and showing a willingness to challenge your own assumptions — not just on political topics but about anything on which the team disagrees. Acknowledge the taxing political environment and appeal to your team members’ compassion. Remind them that even if “someone on the team is voting differently” from them, “they can still care for and deeply respect that person,” says Gregory. It may be tempting to make your workplace a politics-free zone in the interest of team cohesion and unity, but at a time when nearly 60% of American employees say they have engaged in political discussions at work, banning political talk is impractical and counterproductive, according to Gregory. “Putting down barriers about what people can and can’t say hurts team culture more than it builds it,” she says. “Topics shouldn’t be off-limits.” Prohibiting political conversation could also backfire, says Opie. “Some people already feel they are rendered invisible because of what’s happening” on the national stage, and if you, the manager, make certain topics off limits, it could be viewed as sanctioning ignorance and even aggression. So many of today’s big issues concern social justice, equality, and “basic human rights — which are larger than politics.” Of course, not everyone will be interested in having political discussions. Talking about politics or certain politicians “could be a trigger for some colleagues,” says Opie. Make clear that these conversations should only happen between team members who are willing and eager to participate, and no one should be dragged into the discussion, even if they were willing to talk about it previously. These interactions require curiosity and humility — and some days for whatever reason, some people might not be able to summon the interest and restraint, says Gregory. Make sure employees know they can delay the conversation indefinitely, too. Even with you modeling the right behavior, your team may not be skilled at having these types of conversations. “It isn’t your job to teach your team members about politics, but it is your job to teach them how to talk about tough issues,” says Gregory. Even in a poisonous political atmosphere, she believes it’s possible for people from opposite sides of the spectrum to have “positive, productive, and relationship-enhancing conversations.” Some ground rules are necessary, says Opie. “You don’t want employees to feel unsafe discussing certain topics.” As the manager you need to: One of the biggest challenges arises when someone makes an insensitive remark or says something antithetical to the values of your team culture and organization, says Opie. Whatever you do, don’t ignore it. As the leader, “speak up and take a stand,” she says. Gregory concurs. You need to “signal to the group that the comment was inappropriate,” and follow up individually with the person who said it so you don’t give tacit permission for people to speak that way. While it may sound harsh, it’s important you make clear that what they said was offensive and hurtful. Gregory suggests talking to the employee in private and saying something like, “Our organization values diversity and inclusion, and we are going to promote and develop people in alignment with those values. Your comments [about a certain political topic] makes me question whether you have the competencies needed for growth in this organization.” Managers also need to be thoughtful about how the volatile political climate is affecting their employees — particularly on teams where political allegiances vary. The Covid era has made work a lonely place, says Opie. And if you’re in the political minority, the experience is all the more isolating. “If your colleague is feeling upset about the [decision by a grand jury not to charge any police officers with killing Breonna Taylor] and no one brings it up, she might feel ignored. She might wonder, ‘Does anyone care? Do they understand?’ As a manager, you need to bridge that gap,” she says. Focus on connecting with and caring for your employees. Opie suggests you ask, “How can I help you feel heard?” Your goal is to reach out and demonstrate that you “recognize your employees as human beings.” “We are living in self-reinforcing echo chambers,” says Gregory, where we often imagine that others see the world precisely as we do. As a result, many of us make incorrect assumptions about others’ political leanings. The risk is that we end up alienating people because they hold a different view. You need to nurture open-mindedness and urge your team not to jump to conclusions. Remind colleagues that working side-by-side with someone who sees things differently can often be a boon to personal growth. “When we start to disengage with people — when we say, ‘I choose not to have relationships with people who believe X’ — we forego the opportunity to learn about how other people think and to influence them,” says Gregory. Talking about your political views with a team member is complicated by the power dynamic: You’re their boss. Opie recommends “treading carefully.” In the case where a direct report doesn’t share your political inclinations, you mustn’t abuse your position by holding their views against them even on a subconscious level. “You don’t want them to feel that they’re going to be negatively evaluated” due to your different stances, she says. Try to keep an open mind, adds Gregory. “Acknowledge that other people can have different viewpoints” and still be decent human beings, she says. “If you can’t see shades of gray, you’re going to have a hard time being a manager.” It’s not easy to “develop and maintain a cohesive workplace” amidst a hyper-partisan political atmosphere, says Opie. There’s no shame in asking for help. She recommends “connecting with other leaders and managers to learn about how they’re handling these heated situations.” They may offer advice, insight, and ideas that hadn’t occurred to you. Even after Nov. 3, the challenges of running a team with divergent views are likely to remain. “Regardless of who wins, organizations need to think about how they are proactively developing guidelines and discussions for how employees debrief” and process the election, Opie says. “In this charged climate, it will be necessary.” Do Don’t  Case Study #1: Establish ground rules for discussion; be open to others’ perspectives. Over the course of her 25-year career, Susy Dunn has managed a number of teams that had divergent political views. For the most part, her employees have learned to agree to disagree. “In the end, it’s all about handling conflict with respect and empathy,” says Susy, the chief people officer & chief of staff at Zapproved, which makes software for corporate legal departments. “It’s about how you step outside yourself to think about others.” A recent experience stays with her. In 2018, Susy’s team — which is in charge of the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts — organized an event on racism and classism, at which Ijeoma Oluo, the author of the book, So, You Want to Talk about Race, spoke to employees. Many workers were enthralled and energized by the book’s ideas; they began sharing articles on white privilege and organizing discussion groups. This year, as the Black Lives Matter movement and issues surrounding systemic racism became a focal point in the national dialogue, internal conversations around privilege started again. Some colleagues bristled. “Some stepped forward and said they felt uncomfortable and excluded,” says Susy. “They said they were being made to feel ashamed because they were white.” Together with the company’s CEO, Susy met with employees to listen to their perspectives. “Our purpose was to bring people together and to create a safe space to have a difficult conversation.” Susy’s team laid out the ground rules in line with the company’s values: Assume good intent, listen with empathy and curiosity, show respect, and be thoughtful. If things got heated, they would pause and regroup for another time. Employees told personal stories about their lives and explained their perspectives. People were open and honest. When it came time for the CEO and Susy to speak, their message was clear and unapologetic: “If we are going to be asked to prioritize between the comfort of the dominant group over the justice of a marginalized group, we will select the justice of the marginalized group.” It was an “aha moment” for everyone, she says. “People got it.” But Susy also says she recognizes that those who felt uncomfortable had a point, too. “They said they wanted to tune out politics and focus on their work,” she says. “We realize that people need to be able to opt in to certain conversations.” To that end, they created Slack channels dedicated to diversity and equity content. But employees who don’t want to be a part of the dialogue, doing have to join in. Susy says she is proud of how the team came together. “It was a tough but constructive conversation.” Case Study #2: Check in with employees one on one and don’t make assumptions about how they lean. Aimee Pedretti, a senior manager at Mammoth HR, vividly recalls how the results of the 2016 presidential election played out in her office. “The morning after, you could feel the tension,” she says. “Some people were upset and crying, and there were others who, even if they were not expressing jubilation, it was clear they were satisfied with the outcome.” For Aimee, the experience was eye-opening. While she hadn’t necessarily talked politics with each and every one of her colleagues, she had assumed that most people at her company, headquartered in Portland, OR, held similar political values. “I realized the importance of not making assumptions about people’s opinions,” she says. “Not everyone shared the same political beliefs.” She remembers taking solace from the company’s leadership. “Things were heated, and emotions were running high — similar to what’s happening today,” she says. “When I think back on those days, I remember messaging from our CEO. He acknowledged that it was pivotal moment for all Americans. It was comforting to feel that management cared about how the election was affecting us.” The CEO also reminded the team of its company values regarding equality and inclusion. “That really helped level-set us and bring us back to reality: Even if we didn’t all see eye-to-eye on politics, we were all committed to the same purpose and organizational principles.” Today, amidst another turbulent political season, that lesson has served her well. Aimee says she is “focused on her team’s wellbeing,” and regularly checks in with employees one-on-one to make sure they’re coping alright. “Things are so divisive right now outside of work,” she says. “As a leader, it’s important to acknowledge there is a lot of fear and distress about the election regardless of which political party you belong to.” She says she’s also more sensitive about the way she engages with colleagues in conversations about politics — and no longer makes assumptions about how they lean. She tries to lead by example: She demonstrates respect for others’ opinions and an openness to different perspectives. “Managers need to make sure their people feel safe and respected,” she says. “No one should have to stifle who they are.” Recently, Aimee gathered that she holds very different views from some of her colleagues. “In these cases, it’s important to separate the person from their political positions,” she says. “Managers need to be transparent about how they’re assigning work, how they’re promoting people, and how they’re treating people.” Sometimes, she says, it’s easier to engage on neutral topics like pets and hobbies. “There’s no need to force a political conversation.” Rebecca Knight is a freelance journalist in Boston and a lecturer at Wesleyan University.  Her work has been published in The New York Times, USA Today, and The Financial Times."
"13",13,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/whats-wrong-with-asking-where-are-you-from","communication.txt","Asking someone, “Where are you from?” can seem like a very innocuous question but can quickly turn into a microaggression. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. Four years ago, I moved to New York to start pursuing my journalism degree at a graduate program in the city. I spent my first week researching and reporting an audio story about the local farmer’s market. When I handed it in, my professor looked down at the script I had written, looked back up at me, and said, “Your English is good. Where are you from?” While that was supposed to be a compliment, it didn’t feel like a pat on the back. Whether it was based on how I looked, sounded, or information the professor had gathered about me beforehand, their tone implied that, because I was an international student, my ability to write English well (or not) was tied to my geographical and cultural background. I was confused and hurt. This is a question we all ask — and get asked — very often. It comes up during the 10-minute chats we have with our Uber drivers, in job interviews, and even during that awkward small talk at office parties. It may be a question that’s asked out of curiosity (and I do believe that is usually the case), but it has the potential to trigger something very personal: Our sense of belonging. And, that, for a lot of us, can look like alienation. Here is the problem: For those of us who already feel “different” in a given space, being asked where we’re from carries implicit assumptions about our race, caste, ethnicity, nationality, etc. Often, it translates into: You don’t seem to (already) belong here. It validates existing beliefs about social identities and can be quite patronizing. For instance, following-up the question with, “Oh, of course” or “Yes, you do look like you’re from [country]” can force people into neat categories of race, gender, or nationality, without acknowledging the nuances of that person’s identity. None of us have singular identities and most of us belong in many places. People can belong in different geographies, cultures, and identities at the same time. Most of us don’t identify with markers we were born with. So, to me, the question, “Where are you from?” is very reductive. But that’s how I feel about it — and lately, I’ve been thinking, “How do others perceive this question, especially if it’s asked in a professional setting?” So, I reached out to four of my colleagues at Harvard Business Publishing across the globe — who also led an internal Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging panel recently — and asked them how they feel when someone asks them, “Where are you from?” Here’s what I learned from my discussions with them. For Stefano McGhee, a colleague based in the U.S., his last name has always garnered a lot of attention. “My first name is Italian, the last name is Irish, and my paternal family is Black, based in Alabama. So, when I introduce myself to someone, the follow-up question usually is about where I’m from,” he says. However, he doesn’t mind it. In fact, it wasn’t until he was 25 that he learned about the origins of his last name. “During the time of slavery in the [American] South, slaves often took the last name of the slave owner,” he explains. “Somewhere in my history, my ancestors were held by an owner named McGhee.” McGhee finds the question fascinating and wonders if there are others like him, with similar stories about their roots. However, he adds that he is always mindful of the context of the question while he’s answering it. “I’m usually okay if a friend asks me that, but it doesn’t make sense in formal, work situations.” Why? Because questions about someone’s identity can be a microaggression — especially at work. A microaggression is a behavior or action — whether accidentally or purposefully — that subtly undermines someone’s identity by playing into the stereotypes or historic biases about social groups. While the question may not be born out of malicious intent, it can have a serious consequence or impact on the people it is directed towards. In the context of racism, anti-immigration, and anti-minority sentiments, this “curiosity” about someone’s perceived race, ethnicity, and nationality can be quite damaging. Trisha Rai, a former colleague who lives in India, explains that asking this question can often stereotype people. “When someone tells you, they are from [country], and your response is, ‘Oh I love [that country’s] food/music/movies/characters,’ it reduces their complex identities to your limited understanding of a social/identity group they belong to.” That’s harmful because it turns an individual into a representative for a specific culture or identity — and that can be really exhausting for the individual on the receiving end. This often looks like: “Do you have any ideas on how we can celebrate [insert festival] at work?” or “What’s going on with this [news affecting that group]?” This can put pressure on the individual to be responsible to educate others about a specific culture or identity, which turns out to be a lot of work (work that the person asking should really be doing). Maria Ortega, a colleague from Mexico City, says that asking about people’s backgrounds can be an opportunity to build an honest, trusting relationship. But it all depends on how you ask the question — and what you say next. “The tone, the facial expressions, and the follow-up questions — all of that tells me what this person really wants to know,” she says. “For instance, you wouldn’t just ask a colleague if they have kids,” she says. “But, in a conversation, if they mention or talk about their kids, then you can build a conversation from there.” Ortega uses a test to gauge the intentions of the people who put her in a tight spot. “I always wait for the next question someone asks after they hear where I’m from,” she says. That tells her whether the questioner is really interested in getting to know her or whether they’re looking to confirm their own judgments or unconscious bias. If it’s the latter, it’s a microaggression. It’s also about who is asked — and who gets to ask these questions. “It is likely that many of us might be okay with asking our juniors or colleagues about their background, but how many of us have actually asked a senior executive a similar question?” asks Rai. To her, it also reflects power relations between individuals. Questions about our last names, looks, accents, and culture may reinforce and magnify differences between a marginalized community and the majority demographic — which can trigger feelings of alienation. It made me realize (and I’m ashamed to admit) that the only people I have ever asked this question to have been people of color. Often, I have been perplexed (even if I don’t express it) when another South Asian friend has identified as British or American. So, here’s a question Rai nudges us to ask ourselves, “Why am I even asking this question? What do I hope to gain from this specific question, as opposed to say, asking someone about their favorite holiday destination or music band?” From my conversations, I learned that there are no easy answers to this question. It can mean different things in different contexts. For me, I’d be okay telling someone my background history if I met them on a solo trip halfway across the world, but not always in a professional context — particularly if the question feels like it’s coming from a place of ignorance or mal-intent (consciously or not). The tricky thing about microaggressions is that they are mostly unconscious biases — which means it’s so much more important to be mindful of where, when, and how you ask questions about someone’s identity. How can you start? First, know that you will make mistakes. “It is often in these uncomfortable moments, that we are able to engage with why these questions are problematic and learn from them,” Ortega says. “For instance, the use of words like ‘partner’ instead of wife or husband and pronouns like ‘they’ instead of the binary ‘he’ and ‘she’ weren’t common to use at work until a few years ago. It was only because people were called out and made aware of their unconscious biases that we were able to change and use more inclusive language,” she explains. Consider this article your callout. Here’s what you can do to change: Become more aware of your place in the world and the impact your status has on those around you. My Canadian colleague, Mary Shaw, said something that really stayed with me: “I realize that I’m someone with privilege. Of my skin. Of my nationality. Of my general place in the world. And that awareness is useless if it doesn’t translate into more accountability.” According to Shaw, that means operating from a place of kindness. And kindness means different things to different people. “For me, that translates into making personal connections with people — from the simplicity of smiling and saying hello when out on walks (a common politeness in our small town) to never asking “Where are you from?” Pro tip: More privilege means more accountability. Ortega shared how change only happens when we start to listen more than we speak. “The only way to eliminate unconscious biases is to listen more deliberately when someone speaks,” she says. “Listen to what details they give you and have a conversation. Don’t try to box someone’s identity based on what you believe to be markers of said identities.” Before you ask personal questions, be willing to get to know someone better. “The best we can do for ourselves and for historical injustices goes far beyond asking where someone is really from. Better questions surround who they want to be, what their aspirations are, what specific needs you can help them with,” Rai explains. Pro tip: Instead of inquiring about someone’s background, ask, “What is it that you’d like me to know about you?” If you ask something that you immediately regret, address it. Say, “I’m sorry if I crossed a line there. We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t feel comfortable.” If someone doesn’t respond positively to you, understand that they may not be willing to address the question, and let it go. Pro tip: Avoid saying, “Oh, don’t be so sensitive,” or, “I was just joking.” Be sincere in how you apologize and move on from the conversation. In my case, I didn’t confront or seek clarification from my professor. But, if I could go back in time, I’d say, “Thank you, but is there a reason that you asked me where I’m from?” It’s a strategy I’ve learned from a friend — to ask “Why?” until someone sees through their own (unconscious) biases. These conversations can feel awkward to address, especially in multicultural and global workplaces. And that’s okay. All it takes is a little bit of self-awareness and a lot of accountability, so diversity actually makes people feel included.

"14",14,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/what-to-do-when-your-coworker-brings-up-politics","communication.txt","As we continue to make our way through a heated election season, conversations about politics can feel unavoidable, even at work. If you have a colleague who seems intent on bringing politics into a workplace conversation, take a breath. Then replace your judgment with curiosity. Consider putting up boundaries that move the conversation to the proper time and place, increase the likelihood of balanced dialogue, and provide an offramp if needed. Swap certainty for humility. While not always easy to implement, these practices will increase the likelihood of having meaningful conversation. Political topics have always been challenging in the workplace, but never more than now. In the past, the goal was to avoid escalation. Today the conversation often starts heated. Furthermore, they can feel unavoidable, especially if they’re sprung on you with no warning. For example, imagine you’re on a Zoom call discussing accelerating a project deadline when your colleague, “Ned,” says, “This is a product release, not a vaccine.” And that was the fourth time in just this meeting he has laced his comments with politics. You can tell others feel he’s not just making jokes but pushing his opinions. What should you do? No one wants to get into a heated debate with their coworkers, especially over Zoom or the phone. Fortunately, there are ways to venture into these topics that both yield a much higher likelihood of healthy dialogue, and leave you an exit path if it appears that’s not possible. I’ve found it’s possible to talk openly about far more controversial issues than we usually think, as long as you bring three things to the conversation: curiosity, boundaries, and humility. Years ago in London, I hailed a taxi for the 45-minute trip from the Gatwick airport to my hotel. After I informed the driver of my destination, he turned to face me and said, “You have an American accent. Are you American?” “Yes,” I responded. His eyes grew wide, he craned his neck to look back at me, and with great vehemence yelled a curse on the U.S. President. It was late at night. I was tired. I weighed my willingness to engage in an energetic conversation and as I considered ignoring the comment I thought, “I should be able to do this. I should be able to talk to someone with a strong opinion even if I don’t fully agree.” “Not too worried about your tip, I take it?” I said and smiled at his eyes in the mirror. He broke into a broad grin, but it quickly disappeared. He repeated his curse a second time. Then he quickly moved into a lengthy indictment of U.S. foreign policy. His voice got louder and his face redder the more he spoke. He paused only long enough to draw a breath and it was clear he had more than 45 minutes’ worth of material he intended to share. Ironically, I was in London to lecture about a book I had recently co-authored about politically and emotionally risky conversation. Given my itinerary, I felt a special obligation to practice what I was about to preach. So, I committed to attempt turning the remaining 40 minutes into a meaningful dialogue. Remarkably, it worked. Of course, I knew once I got to my hotel that I wouldn’t have to see the driver again, but I was still invested in having a civil, and even productive, conversation. Next time you find yourself drawn into a discussion with someone who has strong political views, whether it’s a stranger or your colleague from another department, here are the three things you want to bring with you. Our temptation when someone comes on strong is to either shut down or amp up. We might withdraw into silence, feigning attention while seething in quiet judgment; or we fight for space, matching or exceeding the others’ provocative certainty. Both approaches produce more heat than light. The way to turn conflict into conversation begins with curiosity. Curiosity is a virtue that need only to be practiced to be passed. It’s remarkable to see how quickly a debate deescalates when one party begins sincerely inquiring into the views of the other. And there almost always comes a point when the one being authentically heard involuntarily reciprocates. For example, once your call ends, you could invite Ned to hang on the connection for a moment. Then start with something like, “Hey Ned, four times in the meeting you made comments that sounded like you were expressing your political views. If at some point you want to discuss those, I’m all ears.” You don’t have to renounce your views in order to practice curiosity. All you have to do is set them aside. Don’t worry, you can pick them back up as soon as the conversation is done. But if you’re simultaneously clutching yours while conversing about others’, you’ll do justice to neither task. You shouldn’t consider your curiosity satisfied until you see the integrity of their position: how the experiences, perspective, and information they bring leads sensibly to the conclusion they hold. The problem with Ned’s offhanded comments in your meeting is the fact that he was turning a business meeting into a political platform. As you invite Ned into a conversation, you should also ask him to honor meeting boundaries. Assuming Ned shows an interest in sharing his views with you, you should first add, “And Ned, can I ask that in the future you avoid those kinds of comments in our meetings? That’s not the time or place for it. Okay?” Setting boundaries at the beginning of a conversation is also helpful if you’re worried it might go off the rails. Before jumping into opinions, first, set the table. Ask for agreement on some boundaries, or ground rules that will keep things civil and balanced. Even people who disagree wildly about specific policies can usually agree quickly on simple rules of civil discourse. And if you gain their agreement before emotions escalate, they’ll often self-monitor in a way that keeps things somewhat healthy. And if they don’t, be sure you set a boundary about how you’ll handle it when someone violates the other rules. Here’s how I set the table for a conversation with my taxi driver. I didn’t wait for him to pause as I didn’t sense one was coming anytime soon. Instead, I patted the back of his seat to interrupt him, and made him a proposition. “I’m very interested in hearing your views,” I said. “I may agree with some of them but disagree with others. But I want equal time. Tell you what, can we agree that you get the first 10 minutes, then I get the next 10 minutes? If either of us gets too angry at the other, we’ll stop and ride quietly to my hotel. If it goes well, we might both be a little smarter when we’re done. Deal?” He laughed heartily, turned to face me full on and said, “That’s a deal.” If you come to the conversation curious, you will almost always leave smarter. But only if you bring the third ingredient: humility. It’s rare that when you begin to genuinely inquire into others’ experiences that you don’t find things that surprise you, teach you, and improve you. The sobering truth is that we don’t arrive at many of our most cherished opinions starting with a blank page. Whether we are Christian or Muslim, conservative or liberal, prefer Coke or Pepsi, our ideas are shaped more by the groups we identify with than the facts we sift through. When we listen sincerely to others, we’re often humbled as we recognize how fragile the foundation of our own convictions can be. When that happens, have the integrity to concede those points. The more you point out areas of agreement, especially ones that involve relinquishing of previously cherished “facts,” the more likely the other person is to feel safe doing the same. Ten minutes into my taxi ride, I was loath to interrupt the driver for my turn. I was so struck with the insight I was gaining seeing my country’s foreign policy from a 12,000-kilometer distance that I didn’t want to stop. I don’t know that my taxi-driver friend ended up seeing the world any differently when we were done with that ride, but I did. Not that my opinions were profoundly altered, but they became nuanced in a way that I was grateful for. The same will happen with Ned if you are truly humble. Don’t approach the conversation with a goal of passing judgment. Approach it with the goal of understanding how Ned’s world works. If you do this well, you’ll begin to see how, given the information and experiences he has, he would come to the conclusions he holds. Feelings of derision are evidence that my motive is to convert not to learn. Next time you cringe with apprehension when a colleague seems intent on bringing politics into a workplace conversation, take a breath. Then replace your judgment with curiosity. Consider putting up boundaries that move the conversation to the proper time and place, increase the likelihood of balanced dialogue, and provide an off ramp if needed. Swap certainty for humility. Perhaps these practices won’t immediately bring about world peace, but they’ll certainly increase the likelihood of meaningful conversation at work.

It’s not because we don’t know the word for it, but because our language doesn’t have a word for it. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. Pause right now. Stop whatever it is that you’re doing, and think about exactly how it feels to be you, in all your complex originality, at this precise moment in time. Maybe a simple label like “tired” or “excited” roughly captures it. But does it really do you justice? Not nearly. Too often, we are constrained by our vocabulary. Our subjective experience is so unique, fine grained, and dynamic that our attempts to express it perfectly rarely succeed. Think of all the feelings and sensations you’ve had during the past few months, and how language totally fails to capture their kaleidoscopic nuances. The trouble is that what we can’t name, we may struggle to fully understand or remember. Over time, the granularity of our experiences ebbs away, leaving us with hazy memories of moments we label with basic words like happy or sad. This is a problem because, as a wealth of research shows, the less we are aware of and understand our feelings, the more we are at their mercy, and the more we struggle to process and manage them effectively. The good news is that help is at hand. While all languages are limited alone, collectively, they can fill in some of our experiential gaps. Almost all languages lack words that can be found in other tongues. In linguistics, these words are known as “untranslatable” terms — though some scholars prefer “unlexicalized” —  and they are the topic of my own research. Perhaps the classic example is the German word Schadenfreude, defined as malicious joy in response to the misfortune of another. You probably have noticed that many English speakers also freely use this term (as indeed I am doing here). All languages “borrow” from one another, taking terms they lack and assimilating them into their lexicon as “loanwords,” thereby enriching the vocabulary of their speakers. That’s how languages evolve. Moreover, when we borrow, we improve our ability to understand our experiences in a differentiated and granular way. As the neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett has argued, such capacities are associated with greater emotional intelligence and improved wellbeing. Here, I am going to empower you with 12 words to help you name some of your elusive experiences. And goodness knows we could do with some assistance here, given how the turmoil of 2020 has destabilized our lives, employment, and careers. Each example features a rough pronunciation guide (in the International Phonetic Alphabet and in rough English phonemes), and a very basic definition (recognizing that words are complex, and these brief descriptions do not capture all their nuances). There are even suggestions for how you might use them in a sentence (bearing in mind that loanword adoption can be inelegant and tricky at first). Bon appétit! Arrangiarsi Italian / v. / a.ranˈʤaːsiː / a-rran-jar-see. Literally, arranging oneself. The art of “making do” or “getting by,” often with creativity and ingenuity in the face of challenges or limited resources. Although it’s a verb (which are less well suited to borrowing), one could imagine it being adopted as a noun, as in, “I got it done eventually with some crafty arrangiarsi.” Arbejdsglæde Danish / n. / ɑːbaɪd̪ʱsˌglɪl / ar-bides-glil. Literally, work joy. Pleasure or satisfaction arising from one’s work and career-related achievements. As in, “I’ve been feeling a lot of arbejdsglæde lately.” Capoter Quebec French Quebec / v. / kapɔte / kah-poe-tay. Literally, to overturn or derail. Can be used in positive ways to express delight or ecstasy, and also in negative ways to imply feeling overwhelmed and/or at a loss. Again, although a verb, one could imagine it being adopted as a noun, as in, “This new job is a real capoter!” Desasosiego Spanish / n. / dɛ.səˌsəʊ.sɪ.ɑːgəʊ / dess-ass-oss-ee-ah-go. Literally, unrest, unease, anxiety. A state where one cannot find solace in body and mind; emptiness, unrest, discomfort, longing and desire all in one. As in, “Twenty-twenty really has been a desasosiego of a year.” Eudaimonia Greek / n. / juːdᵻˈmoʊniə / you-de-moe-nia. Literally, “good spirit” or “good conscience.” Psychological and character development and resulting experiences of flourishing and fulfillment. As in, “Happiness is not only about pleasure and satisfaction, but also involves cultivating eudaimonia.” Feierabend German / n. / faɪɐʔaːbənt / fire-ar-bent. Literally, evening celebration. The upbeat or relaxed mood that can arrive at the end of a working day (though can also just mean the day’s end itself, with no particular festive connotation). As in, “What a day it’s been, but at least it’s Feierabend at last.” Fika Swedish / n. / fiːkæ / fee-kah. Literally, a coffee break, but elevated into an important daily ritual of bonding and connection. As in, “We should start having a regular fika together!” Firgun Hebrew / n. / fɪə.guːn / feer-goon. Literally, unbegrudging empathetic joy. Vicarious and overt (expressed) pride and happiness at other’s successes. Use this to celebrate your colleagues’ achievements (and be celebrated in return)! As in, “I’m full of firgun for you.” Ikigai Japanese / n. / iːkiːɑiː / ee-kee-gaee. Literally, life result, worth, use, or benefit; essentially, having meaning and purpose in life, and a reason for being. In relation to work, it can denote the sweet spot in the Venn diagram where there is a precious alignment between (a) what you are good at, (b) what you enjoy, (c) what the world needs, and (d) what the world can actually pay you for doing. As in, “My ikigai is different from what I do to earn a living.” Sati Pāli / n. / sa:tiː / sah-tee. Literally, recollection or remembrance. Clear, mindful awareness of the present moment, especially in a kindly, non-judgmental spirit. Although this is the origin of the English term “mindfulness,” in its original Buddhist context it incorporated ethical and spiritual dimensions that are often missing from contemporary definitions of mindfulness. As in, “It’s really important to bring a spirit of sati into the workplace.” Savoir faire French / n. / sav.waʀ.fɛʀ / sav-wah-fare. Literally, knowing how to do. The ability to behave in a correct and confident way in different situations; charisma, diplomacy, and verve. As in, “She really lights up the room with her savoir faire.” Ubuntu Zulu / n. / ʊˈbuːntʊ / uu-boon-tuu. Literally, humanity, or I am because you are. Connection, compassion and kindness on the basis of common humanity; mutual understanding, care, and respect. As in, “Ultimately, ubuntu is what matters, and we need to do right by other people.” Tim Lomas is a senior researcher for the Wellbeing for Planet Earth Foundation, and a senior lecturer in positive psychology at the University of East London. Tim has published over 70 papers and 11 books relating to wellbeing, involving topics including linguistics, systems theory, neuroscience, mindfulness, Buddhism, gender, art, and cross-cultural enquiry. His current main area of research involves creating a lexicography of untranslatable words relating to wellbeing."
"16",16,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/storytelling-can-make-or-break-your-leadership","communication.txt","Telling a compelling story is how you build credibility for yourself and your ideas. In this piece, the author draws on his experience as a speaker, publisher, and author to illustrate five characteristics of effective storytelling. He suggests that strong stories must be audience-specific, clearly contextualized, human-centric, action-oriented, and humble. Whether you’re winning over a colleague, a recruiter, or an entire conference audience, making sure you stick to these guidelines will help you convey care and compassion when presenting even the most daunting of ideas. “It’s a new goal-setting framework.” That was one of my large enterprise clients’ attempt at an inspirational rallying cry for their rollout of Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs. As you might expect, it wasn’t met with much enthusiasm: “Why do we need a new goal-setting system?” managers and employees protested. “What will this mean for my evaluation? Am I still on track for that promotion?” The problem wasn’t anything inherent to the proposal — instead, what was lacking was the executive’s storytelling. Telling a compelling story is how you build credibility for yourself and your ideas. It’s how you inspire an audience and lead an organization. Whether you need to win over a colleague, a team, an executive, a recruiter, or an entire conference audience, effective storytelling is key. As a speaker, publisher, and author of four books and dozens of articles, I’ve found that my most effective stories all shared the following five characteristics: It may sound basic, but if you want to know what your target audiences is curious about, what worries them, and what motivates them, a series of quick, informal conversations is often the most effective way to figure it out. You can then infuse your storytelling with words that speak to your audience’s specific anxieties or concerns, while avoiding language that will come across as bland platitudes. That was the first mistake my client made around their OKRs announcement — they assumed that the same message would be effective for all 10,000 employees. But this audience included managers and individual contributors, veteran employees and new hires, people who were already aware of the OKR framework and others who had never heard of it. Furthermore, the audience was particularly concerned because this announcement had the potential to impact how all of these different groups were evaluated and promoted. As such, a better approach would have been to craft a variety of different rollout announcements addressing the specific questions and concerns of each subgroup within the organization. Another major issue with the OKR rollout was that the various announcements made about it failed to contextualize why now was the right time to make this change. To many employees, it seemed like yet another random, top-down management initiative. Had the story of the rollout explained how it fit into the broader vision of the company, its background, and future strategy, that would have helped people understand where the changes were coming from and why they were important. For example, they could have provided a statement along these lines: Our roots are in industrial manufacturing, and the goal-setting frameworks we’ve been using were designed to be effective in that world. As we now transform into a digital, software-enabled company, those frameworks no longer make sense. We’ve invested in a variety of projects over the past five years to increase our digital capabilities, and those new ways of working require new ways of setting goals. A personal anecdote can both lighten the mood and illustrate your perspective more effectively, helping your audience feel less skeptical and more open to your ideas. For example, when speaking to my leadership clients, I’ll often bring up the six months I spent traveling with a circus. While this might seem completely unrelated to the business context at hand, stories about my time hanging out with the human cannonball always get a laugh, and more importantly, my experience handling a strange new situation, building relationships, learning a new culture, failing often, and ultimately integrating successfully into a totally new world often turns out to be extremely relevant to my clients. Similarly, the executives tasked with announcing the OKRs might kick things off with a personal story: As some of you know, I enjoy skydiving. They say your mind goes blank when you jump out of an airplane, but last weekend, as I was stepping out of the door at 12,000 feet, it dawned on me that I had a clear objective: to maintain a work/life balance that reminds me regularly why both are important. And what were my key results? Well, at least one of them was to land 100% of my jumps without major injuries. As you can see, so far so good! This kind of clarity around our objectives is what I hope to achieve for our company with this new OKR framework. Specificity reduces anxiety. If you give your audience practical advice and clear direction, you empower them to take action and make your story their own. Initially, my client described the OKR rollout with impressive-sounding, but ultimately unhelpful platitudes: “It will change how we work. It will redefine success for the company. It will bring us closer to the customer,” they declared. And these things were all true. But they did nothing to help people understand what the changes would actually mean for them, day to day, as they began setting and working towards their new goals. Instead, a more effective approach would be to focus on exactly what changes people would need to make: Instead of relying on a roadmap with fixed initiatives and feature launch dates, we’re going to set quarterly check-in dates for assessing our progress towards customer metrics like retention, average order value, and customer acquisition cost. This means that executives and middle managers will no longer be prescribing work to product teams, but instead, teams will be responsible for developing their own plans for how best to achieve these goals. In addition, we will be offering training courses and long-term coaching to support teams as they make this transition. If you’re interested, just reach out to your manager and they’ll help you get started. It’s normal to wince at the idea of baring your failures in front of colleagues, a conference audience, or a recruiter. But true humility shows capacity for growth and learning. It builds trust in your story precisely because it demonstrates that you’re not claiming to have all the answers, and that you’re willing to learn and adjust course as needed. In my experience, nothing creates a tighter connection between you and your audience than acknowledging that you’re standing on others’ shoulders, and you’re not going get everything right all the time. In the case of the OKRs announcement, a dose of humility might look something like this: Many of you may remember the last time we tried to update our goal-setting system. I was COO at the time, and I was one of the main drivers for that change. Many of you will also remember how badly that initiative failed. That was my fault. I pushed the change too quickly without a clear understanding of how to support the organization through that transition. I’ve learned so much from that experience, and I’m continuing to look to all of you for your valuable suggestions and support to ensure this OKR rollout is a success. Storytelling can make or break any initiative. A poor storyteller can butcher even the best ideas, while a strong storyteller can present a daunting concept with care and compassion for their audience. It will take practice, but when done well, good storytelling can make a major impact on your team, your organization, and your entire career.

"17",17,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/how-men-can-confront-other-men-about-sexist-behavior","communication.txt","Confronting other men for sexism, bias, harassment, and all manner of inappropriate behavior may be the toughest part of male allyship. But it’s also utterly essential. While the prospect of speaking up against transgressions can feel overwhelming, there are steps you can take to make it easier. Within two seconds of hearing an inappropriate comment, call it out — even if it’s just saying “Ouch.” When you say something, own it. Use I-statements to signal that the behavior didn’t land the right way with you. Alternatively, try Socratic questions to disrupt gender bias and trigger self-reflection, or share what you’ve learned through a personal experience or relationship. Humor can also work now and then, particularly if you have an existing relationship with a male coworker. Finally, show him that you’re on his side and follow up with positive reinforcement. Globally, most men support gender equality and believe they are contributing in meaningful ways. While some men may be doing their part in interpersonal allyship — mentorships and other professional relationships and support to push women forward — few are helping with public allyship — becoming courageous watchdogs for equity, dignity, respect, and fairness in the workplace. Perhaps this explains evidence showing that 77% of men believe they are doing all they can to support gender equality, while only 41% of women agree. That means men must do more to speak up and speak out when they see bad behavior. Active confrontation of other men for sexism, bias, harassment, and all manner of inappropriate behavior may be the toughest part of male allyship. It is also utterly essential. For many men, challenging masculine workplace norms is where the cost of allyship gets real in a hurry. We define confrontation this way: Bringing sexism and exclusion of women to the attention of men who knowingly or unknowingly instigate and perpetuate these attitudes and outcomes in their words and actions. Why is it so important that men stand willing to confront other men when they demean, offend, or harass — even if it’s unintentional? There are several reasons. First, women who call out bad male behavior often are evaluated negatively, even rated as less competent compared to a man that does the same. Second, when a man (someone without an apparent vested interest in gender fairness and equity) confronts bias or sexism, observers are more likely to be persuaded. Third, how a message is received is often less about precise wording and more about the in-group identity of the speaker. A confrontation intended to change attitudes and behavior has more impact when it comes from someone perceived to be similar — in this case, another man who can claim, “That’s not who we [men] are” and “That’s not what we [guys] do.” Finally, quite often, men fear they’re the only guy in the room who objects to a sexist comment or raunchy joke (though evidence shows lots of men are offended), so they stay silent when they could break the spell and enable other male allies to find their voice if only they’d speak up. While the prospect of speaking up against transgressions can feel overwhelming, there are steps you can take to make it easier. Drawn from our research for our new book Good Guys, here are six confrontation strategies you can apply right now in your interactions at work: Use the two-second rule. The well-documented bystander effect too often plays out in the workplace when men stay on the sidelines, timid and mute in the face of obvious gender bias and sexism. To combat the paralysis that sets in mere seconds after another man delivers a sexist comment or demeaning joke, just say something! We recommend the ouch technique: Simply say “Ouch!” clearly and forcefully. This buys you a few extra seconds to formulate a clear statement about why the comment didn’t land well with you. Then, have some ready responses cued up in advance, such as: When you say something, own it. When you confront another man, don’t attribute your concern or offense to the fact that there’s a woman in the room or that women might be offended. Too often we hear half-hearted confrontations such as, “Come on, Bob. There are women in the room.” This implies that Bob’s sexist comment would be acceptable if no women were in sight. Instead, use clear I-statements to signal that the behavior didn’t land the right way with you, such as, “I didn’t find that joke amusing, Bob. I don’t appreciate the way it demeans women,” or “I’d really appreciate it if you’d stop referring to our female colleagues as ‘girls.’ They are women.” Use Socratic questions as a confrontation device. Quite often, a Socratic question can serve both to disrupt gender bias and trigger self-reflection in a male colleague. For instance, many women have experienced having a creative idea ignored during a meeting, only to have it repackaged by a male before the meeting ends. Next time you bear witness to such co-opting of a female colleague’s idea, ask a thoughtful question designed to remind everyone in the room — including the offender — who generated the idea in the first place: “I’m confused, Charles. How is that any different from what Amber suggested a few minutes ago?” The Socratic question can also be quite effective in helping a male colleague consider an alternative perspective. Lisen Stromberg of Prismwork Consulting recommends something as simple as, “I wonder if you’ve considered that women might experience this differently?” Share what you’ve learned through a personal experience or relationship. Sometimes, confrontation through self-disclosure can be a powerful approach. Sharing authentically how bias or sexism was harmful to someone close to you can cause other men to do a double take, seeing their own behavior through a new lens. Saying, calmly but firmly, “My wife experienced this at work, and it’s unacceptable! I don’t want women to experience that here,” can be deeply influential for other men. You can even make this aspirational by connecting this feedback to who he wants to be by saying, “I know you’re a good guy, and I wouldn’t want you to inadvertently offend women by suggesting they should smile more.” Use humor now and then. Particularly when you have an existing relationship with a male coworker or peer, try a short humorous observation as an intervention. For instance, when a guy calls a female colleague “sweetheart,” try, “Do you call all your software developers ‘sweetheart’?” Or, when a team member regularly interrupts your female colleague in a meeting, try some sports-related humor. Toss a yellow sticky note on the table, and say, “Penalty! That’s 10 yards for interrupting.” Show him that you’re on his side. Creating real behavior change in other men is best achieved through an artful blend of challenge and reinforcement. A group of real allies can turn confrontation into “carefrontation” as one informal group of executive leaders shared with us. So, when a guy goes off the rails with sexism or harassing humor, first, use language that lets him know you see him as part of your tribe and that your heart is in the right place. Pull him aside after a meeting and have a direct conversation. Show that you are worried about him; use I-statements that aren’t accusatory, but also let him know how you feel as a friend and colleague. In clarifying the precise behavior of concern, be specific in the details, situation, and people involved. You don’t have to take the conversation to “DEFCON 5,” but you do have to make him understand how his behavior is hurting others, sabotaging his credibility, and why you care. Then, when he shows some gender awareness or an inclusive mindset, be sure to follow up with some positive reinforcement. Confronting other men about their missteps is not about humiliation, shaming, or angry altercations. And there is no one-size-fits-all approach. At times, a private conversation after the meeting will get a more positive result, especially if the perpetrator is a close colleague, open to feedback, and well-meaning but naïve, or out of step with changing attitudes and expectations. At other times it is essential to confront in public, especially if the comment or behavior was egregious and likely to dispirit coworkers and damage the relational environment, or if the perpetrator is a serial offender, rigid in his attitudes toward women, and unlikely to respond to private corrective feedback. Allyship is hard work. It takes a deft touch and a thoughtful and empathetic ally to create lasting and meaningful change. Excellent allies have the courage to get comfortable doing the uncomfortable work of disrupting the status quo. W.

First, use regular meetings to set vision, align roles, agree on goals, or do other creative and strategic discussions. Then, share documents asynchronously through file sharing services. You can work side by side through video on a shared product to ask questions and encourage productivity. Finally, carefully approach how and when you use messaging to ensure that you have time for focused work, while balancing team communication.

Team collaboration done right is a powerful force to align a group of individuals to accomplish a common goal in the most effective way possible. But even the best collaborations, filled with smart, capable, and experienced team members, can be a struggle. Done wrong, collaborative projects can feel like a waste of time where individuals spend more time talking about doing things than actually getting things done. Collaboration is especially difficult now, during the pandemic. Organic collaboration is almost impossible when you’re working remotely. Catching up on the latest projects and exciting new experiments — or where a project may be struggling — could easily be covered during frequent hallway chats, but those opportunities won’t happen in a remote environment unless you’re intentional. And collaboration isn’t effective when you loosely and sporadically message about initiatives and don’t have a structured approach to answering important questions, aligning team members, and driving to the main goal. For team collaboration to work remotely, you and your teammates must be clear and strategic about how you will collaborate. The logistics of collaboration are not the only obstacle facing team members. Time is also a concern. Many individuals have extra work on their plates, due to Covid-19-related complexities and hiring freezes, and their schedules are more disparate than ever, juggling working from home with child care and remote schooling. How do you get team members to come together to focus their time and attention on your project? As a time management coach, I know to be most effective at work, you have to be purposeful about how you invest every precious minute. Here’s how to do team collaboration right, even as you’re facing pandemic- and remote work-related challenges. If you need to brainstorm, set vision, align roles, agree on goals, or do other creative and strategic discussions, a meeting will likely be your most efficient method for getting these activities done. You may be tempted to add a recurring meeting to the calendar, but when you can, try to work these items into existing standing meetings instead, so you’re not adding more to people’s already overcrowded schedules — for example, you may decide that once a month your regular team meeting takes a more strategic focus instead of a tactical one. Set an agenda in advance and assign someone to facilitate the meeting to keep the group on track and drive decision making. Also, have someone take notes and route them to stakeholders, so you don’t have to waste precious time by having another meeting about the same topic in the future. If you need feedback on material, and it’s okay for the communication to be asynchronous, share a document. You can do this through Google Docs, Teams, Slack, or whatever other file-sharing service is approved by your organization. When you use this method, be sure to set a deadline for review, turn on track changes, and be clear on exactly what you need from the reviewers in the document. Everything should be self-explanatory, so that if your colleague has to look at the document after they’ve tucked in their kids at night (and therefore can’t reach out to a teammate in the moment), no clarification is required. If you’re back in the office — or never left — working side by side may naturally happen. But for some of my coaching clients who work remotely, I’ve seen a trend toward “virtual side-by-side” working. What this looks like is on a video call with a colleague, do your work on a particular shared project at the same time. This way, you can easily stop and ask them a question or ask for feedback whenever you get stuck. Since the person is already “there” and working on something similar, the collaboration can move forward more smoothly. This strategy is also effective if you find yourself avoiding something difficult at work. The positive peer pressure that someone is physically present with you and expects you to get a certain activity done in that window of time can be a good incentive to help you overcome approach avoidance. Although collaborative chat tools, like Slack, Teams, and Flock, are incredibly popular and often seen as the “key” to team collaboration, make sure that they’re working for you instead of you working for them. Decide how often and for how long you’ll engage with the appropriate channels. For some of my coaching clients that can mean as little as 10 minutes once a day to skim through the most relevant messages. For others, it looks like checking in multiple times a day or having their messaging tool open except for when they need to be super-focused. And if you find that you can’t easily solve a problem through chat, switch the conversation to a call. By doing this, you take more control over your time, and the entire team has a better understanding of when they’ll hear back from you. The purpose behind team collaboration isn’t for you to always be available. Instead, it’s to make sure that you and your team are aligned on your goals and most effectively moving ahead in accomplishing them. You can collaborate effectively from far apart, even when you have an incredible amount to do, if you collaborate with intention and focus.

"19",19,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/to-foster-innovation-cultivate-a-culture-of-intellectual-bravery","communication.txt","If you want your team to innovate, you need to create a culture of intellectual bravery, in which team members are willing to disagree, dissent, or challenge the status quo even when it requires they risk being embarrassed, marginalized, or punished. As a leader, make this possible by rewarding (or punishing) vulnerability and risk-taking. The author suggests seven ways you can set the right tone on your team and encourage psychological safety. For example, respond constructively to feedback or bad news and if you reject feedback, explain exactly why. Also, encourage people to think beyond their roles and consider assigning someone to play the role of devil’s advocate. Perhaps most important, model vulnerability. Share your mistakes. Ask exploratory questions. Admit what you don’t know. When an organization stops innovating, it is only a matter of time before it fails. But what causes a company to cease coming up with new ideas? Over the last 20 years, I’ve studied many failed organizations and one of the things I consistently see is an almost imperceptible erosion of intellectual bravery. Intellectual bravery is a willingness to disagree, dissent, or challenge the status quo in a setting of social risk in which you could be embarrassed, marginalized, or punished in some way. When intellectual bravery disappears, organizations develop patterns of willful blindness. Bureaucracy buries boldness. Efficiency crushes creativity. From there, the status quo calcifies and stagnation sets in. The responsibility for creating a culture of intellectual bravery lies in leadership. As a leader, you set the tone, create the vibe, and define the prevailing norms. Whether or not your company has a culture of intellectual bravery depends on your ability to establish a pattern of rewarded rather than punished vulnerability. Let me share two examples. Team A — Punished Vulnerability: Last year, I spent a day with a software development team — a group of talented people with high expectations for themselves. This team was behind schedule, over budget, and not making progress as expected. Each member of the team had a track record of solid individual performance, so the prospect of failing on this project created a level of anxiety and frustration they had not experienced before. The leader had given the team guidance about a specific user experience design he preferred, but when team members tried to offer an alternative point of view, he would cut off the conversation and tell them to get back to work. When he finally understood that his UX ideas were not working, he reacted with anger and pointed out the team’s failing in an all-hands meeting. This activated everyone’s self-censoring instinct, and iced the team into crippling silence. It was now risky for anyone to say what they really thought, so the team members retreated into risk management, pain avoidance, and loss prevention — a reasonable reaction. At the very time the leader needed to inspire his team, he created a collective stupor, and his actions were met with compliance, disengagement, and a lack of critical thinking from the team. Team B — Rewarded Vulnerability: I worked with another software development team at a different company. They were on deadline for a new version release and had been working around the clock. Because of the stakes, the margin of error was low and the pressure was on. But in this case, the team members didn’t seem worried about social risk and spoke up regardless of hierarchy and power with energy and enthusiasm. I watched a new team member push back on a senior leader’s suggestion. Another person asked a naive question. Another shared a mistake she had made and wanted to discuss. In short, the level of psychological safety in the room matched the level of personal exposure required to challenge the status quo. They engaged in small and large acts of vulnerability without fear of ridicule or retaliation. Why? Because they had been given a license to disagree. Most impressive was the team’s ability to maintain creative abrasion and constructive dissent without collapsing into debilitating tension, personal attacks, or silence. The leader rewarded the teams’ acts of vulnerability with permission to engage in more acts of vulnerability. That pattern became the norm. How did the leader of Team B do it? She created comfort and protection for team members to speak up. Employees naturally engage in threat detection as they interact in the workplace. If they see evidence that other employees have been marginalized, embarrassed, or punished in some way because of their position, gender, ethnicity, age, neurodiversity, or another demographic variable, they use that information to decide whether or not to be vulnerable — even for something as seemingly benign as asking a question. For instance, a new employee may hesitate to ask a question because he perceives that he is not authorized to contribute until he gains more tenure. Or a woman of color may not express an important insight because she witnesses instances of gender and racial bias. By reducing social risk, you can create a culture of intellectual bravery, making it more likely that people will feel comfortable speaking up. Based on my research with diverse, global teams, I’ve found seven ways to create intellectual bravery on your team: Encouraging psychological safety isn’t easy; it requires a high level of emotional intelligence and a highly controlled ego. Arguably, a leader’s most important job — perhaps above that of creating a vision and setting strategy — is to nourish a context in which people are given air cover in exchange for candor. That’s how you create a culture of intellectual bravery."
"20",20,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/the-agile-family-meeting","communication.txt","After fifteen years of research on what makes for a happy family, the author stumbled upon a surprising idea: that techniques borrowed from agile development can work just as well for family meetings as they do at work. He recommends a weekly family meeting that is based around just three questions: What worked well in our family this week? What didn’t work well in our family this week? What will we agree to work on this week? This simple framework will help families manage the chaos, get along better, and reduce stress. At a moment when many families around the world are confined to home, climbing the walls, and are searching desperately for fresh techniques for managing their household chaos, one proven solution that my family, along with many others, uses comes from an unlikely source: agile development. It’s no secret that working parents face enormous pressures. Ellen Galinsky, of the Families and Work Institute, asked a thousand children, “If you were granted one wish about your parents, what would it be?” When she asked parents to predict what their children would say, the parents said: “Spending more time with us.” They were wrong.  The kids’ number 1 wish: that their parents were less tired and less stressed. So how can we reduce that stress and help families to become happier? I spent the last 15 years trying to answer that question, meeting families, scholars, and experts ranging from a founder of the Harvard Negotiation Project to online game designers to Warren Buffett’s bankers. I published my finding in the bestselling book The Secrets of Happy Families and have found myself doubling down on many of those ideas in this time of flux of stress. The single best solution I found may be the simplest of all: hold regular family meetings to discuss how you’re managing your family. A few years ago, my research brought me to the Starr family home in Hidden Springs, Idaho. The Starrs are an ordinary American family with their share of ordinary American family issues. David is a software developer; Eleanor is a stay-at-home mom. At the time, their four children ranged in age from 10 to 15. Like many parents, the Starrs were trapped in that endless tension between the sunny, smooth-running household they aspired to be living in and the exhausting, ear-splitting one they were actually living in. “I tried the whole ‘love them and everything will work out’ philosophy,” Eleanor said. “but it wasn’t working. ‘For the love God,’ I said, ‘I can’t take this anymore.’” What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising. Instead of turning to their parents, their peers, or even a professional, they looked to David’s workplace. Specifically, to a philosophy of business problem solving that David had studied and taught: agile development. The techniques worked so well for their family that David wrote a white paper about it, and the idea spread from there. When my wife, Linda, and I adopted this blueprint into our home, weekly family meetings quickly became the single most impactful idea we introduced into our lives since the birth of our children. The idea of agile was invented in the 1980s in large measure through the leadership of Jeff Sutherland. A former fighter pilot in Vietnam, Sutherland was chief technologist at a financial firm in New England when he began noticing how dysfunctional software development was. Companies followed the “waterfall model,” in which executives issued ambitious orders from above that then flowed down to harried programmers below. “Eighty-three percent of projects came in late, over budget, or failed entirely,” Sutherland told me. Sutherland designed a new system, in which ideas flowed not just down from the top but up from the bottom and groups were designed to react to changes in real time. The centerpiece is the weekly meeting that’s built around shared decision making, open communication, and constant adaptability. Such meetings are easy to replicate in families. In my home, we started when our twin daughters were five and chose Sunday afternoons. Everyone gathers around the breakfast table; we open with a short, ritualistic drum tapping on the table; then, following the agile model, we ask three questions. From the very beginning, the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters’ mouths. What worked well in our family this week? “Getting over our fears of riding a bike,” “We’ve been doing much better making our beds.” What went wrong? “Doing our math sheets,” “Greeting visitors at the door.” Like most parents, we found our children to be something of a Bermuda Triangle: words and thoughts would go in, but few ever came out. Their emotional lives were invisible to us. The family meeting provided that rare window into their innermost thoughts. The most satisfying moments came when we turned to the topic of what we would work on during the coming week. The girls loved this part of the process, particularly selecting their own rewards and punishments. Say hello to five people this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed. Kick someone, lose dessert for a month. Turns out they were little Stalins. Naturally, there was a gap between the girls’ off-the-charts maturity during theses 20-minute sessions and their behavior the rest of the week, but that didn’t seem to matter. It felt to us as if we were laying massive underground cables that wouldn’t fully light up their world for many years to come. Ten years later, we still holding these family meetings every Sunday. Linda counts them as among her most-treasured moments as a mom. So what did we learn? 1. Empower the children. Our instinct as parents is to issue orders to our children. We think we know best; it’s easier; who has time to argue? And besides, we’re usually right! There’s a reason few systems have been more “waterfall” than the family. But as all parents quickly discover, telling your kids the same thing over and over is not necessarily the best tactic. The single biggest lesson we learned from our experience with agile practices is to reverse the waterfall as often as possible. Enlist the children whenever possible in their own upbringing. Brain research backs up this conclusion. Scientists at the University of California and elsewhere found kids who plan their own time, set weekly goals, and evaluate their own work build up their prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain that help them exert greater cognitive control over their lives. These so-called “executive skills” aid children with self-discipline, avoiding distraction, and weighing the pros and cons of their choices.  By participating in their own rewards and punishment, children become more intrinsically motivated. 2. Parents aren’t infallible. Another instinct we have as parents is to build ourselves up, to be Mr. or Ms. Fix-it. But abundant evidence suggests type of leadership is no longer the best model. Researchers have found that the most effective business teams are not dominated by a charismatic leader. Rather, members of particularly effective teams spend as much time talking to one another as to the leader, meet face to face regularly, and everyone speaks in equal measure. Sound familiar? “One thing that works in family meetings,” David Starr told me, “is the kids are allowed to say whatever they want, even about the grownups. If I’ve come back from a trip and am having trouble reentering the routine, or if mom hasn’t been nice that week, this is a safe venue to express their frustration.” 3. Build in flexibility. Another assumption parents often make is that we have to create a few overarching rules and stick to them indefinitely. This philosophy presumes we can anticipate every problem that will arise over many years. We can’t. A central tenet of the tech sector is if you’re doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago, you’re doing something wrong. Parents can learn a lot from that idea. The agile family philosophy accepts and embraces the ever-changing nature of family life. It’s certainly not lax; think of all the public accountability. And it’s not anything goes. But it anticipates that even the best designed system will need to be re-engineered midstream. *** As I was leaving the Starrs’ home, I asked Eleanor what’s the most important lesson I should learn from the first agile family. “In the media, families just are,” she said. “But that’s misleading. You have your job; you work on that. You have your garden, your hobbies, you work on those. Your family requires just as much work. The most important thing agile taught me is that you have to make a commitment to always keep working to improve your family.” What’s the secret to a happy family, in whatever situation you find yourself and whatever kind of stress you face? Try."
"21",21,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/case-study-stick-with-a-bad-new-job-or-cut-your-losses","communication.txt","Mia Ricci’s first day was off to a bad start. She’d been excited about her new role as a program manager at Rescue, the oldest and largest aid organization fighting global poverty. She’d risen early; walked her dogs; eaten breakfast with her boyfriend, Mateo; packed a lunch; and still managed to get to the office before 9:00. She’d thought arriving early would make a good impression.   When Mia walked into the lobby, she saw a few familiar faces from her previous visit, but the receptionist was the only one to greet her. His name was Anthony, and although she thought they’d bonded last time, he looked up at her quizzically. “Can I help you?” he asked. “It’s great to see you again,” Mia said. “I’m Mia, the new program manager.” “Oh, right,” Anthony said, unsmiling. “Take a seat, and I’ll give you some paperwork to fill out while I grab your manager. It’s Michael, right?” Mia had been in the building for less than five minutes and already she felt discouraged. Things didn’t improve from there. Anthony couldn’t find Michael, so he escorted her back to a dim room full of cubicles. The one person already there, a support team coordinator named Jessie Carbone, introduced herself quickly, explained that IT hadn’t set up Mia’s desk yet, suggested that she sit at a vacant workstation, and went back to typing. At 10:30 Michael finally stopped by to hand Mia a stack of reading material and explain that his day was packed but he hoped to catch up with her later that afternoon. He never did.1 Mia spent five hours coordinating with HR and IT via her cell phone and personal email account. She ate lunch at the borrowed desk. A few other employees came in and out during the day, and she smiled warmly and waved, but no one seemed to know who she was. Finally a technician arrived with a laptop and a monitor, which he installed at the desk farthest from the window. Mia found herself thinking wistfully about her previous workplace, Azzurro, a start-up that used IoT-enabled container sensors to help retail businesses better manage waste. She’d joined it just after graduating from the University of Bologna with a degree in international management and had been promoted to business analyst in less than four years. She liked the work and the people. But then she met Saul Rizzo, a senior HR director at Rescue, at a networking event. He mentioned a role at the organization’s new outpost in Bologna—one of its 92 offices worldwide—and Mia was immediately intrigued. The job would include setting up data and reporting systems and working with a seasoned Rescue manager to outline critical business processes and identify key performance indicators. At an interview a few weeks later, Saul had offered her a salary nearly double what Azzurro was paying her and promised that she would not only have a personal growth plan but also be able to work on the ground once a month helping populations in crisis. It had seemed like a no-brainer to make the move. Mateo agreed. Now, considering whether she should book a meeting with Michael for the next day—basically forcing him to onboard her properly—Mia wondered if she’d made the right decision.2 Just then she got a text from Mateo: “How was it???” She replied with a thumbs-down emoji and “I need a drink. Let’s meet at the usual spot.” “It was a disaster,” Mia said after recounting her workday. Mateo nodded empathetically. “Do you think I made a mistake? I mean, I really liked Azzurro, but the humanitarian work sold me on Rescue.” “Don’t forget the pay!” Mateo said jokingly. Mia sighed. As the primary breadwinner in their household (Mateo was a struggling artist), she was already feeling the pressure.3 “Seriously, though,” he went on. “It’s too early to know. It’s such a different culture, and Rescue is a huge organization. How many employees did Azzurro have?” “A hundred,” she said. “Rescue has thousands.” “Right. And they’re just setting up this branch. It may be a particularly chaotic time.”4 “It’s just so weird to have no official welcome, no onboarding, not even any real assignment. I’ve spoken with Michael only twice—on the phone during the interview process and very briefly this morning. You’d think he’d want to at least have a conversation with me on my first day.” “I’m sure it was an anomaly,” Mateo said. “Tomorrow will be better. Rescue is reputable, and on paper this is a good career move.” “I know, I know. You’re right.” Mia gulped her wine. She just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The following afternoon Mia finally met with Michael. “Mia, welcome,” he said brusquely. “Sorry I couldn’t get to you earlier—I’ve been tied up in strategy meetings. As you can see, we’re still getting our systems in order. Let’s talk about your first project.” He said he wanted her to audit the processes of three departments—warehouse, supply chain, and delivery—that were essential to Rescue’s missions. Each unit combined employees transferred from other Rescue offices and recent hires brought in to help experiment with new strategies. Mia’s job was to see whether those strategies were more efficient than Rescue’s current ones. The assignment was not what she had expected, but she nodded and smiled. “Anything else?” Michael asked, turning back to his laptop. “Actually,” Mia said, “when I was recruited, Saul mentioned that I’d have a chance to participate in some field projects.” Michael looked surprised—and a little annoyed. “Hmm. I don’t mean to disappoint you, Mia, but that’s not what I had in mind for this position. We’re just building this operation, and we need internal staff members to stay focused on their responsibilities here.” He shook his head. “I’m sorry, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon.” “OK,” Mia said, trying to hide her dismay.5 Mia spent the next three weeks toiling away at the auditing project, but it wasn’t easy. Michael had forgotten to introduce her to a few department heads, so although some were friendly and forthcoming, others ignored her repeated emails or only reluctantly shared information. She’d asked Michael for advice several times, but he’d basically blown her off. And when her work was finished, it took her five days to get half an hour with him to present her findings. He’d been complimentary but then asked her to track some new metrics. She asked about broadening the scope of her duties, but his phone rang, and he waved her away. “Sorry, I have to take this. Let’s discuss next time we meet.”6 Desperate to confide in someone besides Mateo, Mia asked Jessie if she’d ever had any problems getting Michael’s attention. “It’s not his fault,” Jessie said. “It’s this organization. It’s just such a bureaucracy. He has to run every new idea up the food chain. We’re always short-staffed because they’re always opening new offices. And they move people around so much that everyone’s constantly in learning mode, trying to get up to speed on a new geography. Don’t get me wrong—we do amazing work out in the field. We do help people. But inside, it’s a slog.”7 “Do you ever get involved in that outside work?” Mia asked. “Oh, no. We’re the back office. Our job is to help the people who are experts at fieldwork do theirs.” Her heart sank. Mia decided she’d email Saul and request a video call. To her surprise, he replied within the hour and said he had 30 minutes free at 5:00. Mia was determined to be up-front about her disappointment. She outlined how unnecessarily difficult her initial assignment had been and how rarely she interacted with Michael, even though she thought part of her job was to partner with him on performance indicators. “Plus he doesn’t seem open to my doing any direct humanitarian work, even though that was a big pull for me,” she said. Saul looked concerned. “I know, and I mentioned that to him. My sense is that the audits are just the first step and that you’ll get into the more interesting work soon. He may have forgotten our discussion because things are so hectic right now.” He asked her to be patient and promised to talk with Michael. “We’re lucky you’re here, Mia. Let’s see if we can turn things around.”8 That evening Mia was doing the dishes after dinner when her phone signaled a new email. It was from Michael. She called Mateo into the kitchen to hear the message: “Dear Mia, I’m writing to let you know that I spoke with Saul this evening. We discussed your role and the misalignments that resulted in a negative experience for you. Given the demands of my role, it’s difficult for me to meet regularly with all the members of my team, but I’m happy to set up a weekly check-in to support you. There are certain tasks that will greatly benefit the organization that I’d like you to stick with. But there may be other responsibilities we can add that would be more in line with your interests. Best regards, Michael” “Hmm,” Mateo said. “Is he sorry for being such a bad boss since you started, or is he angry at you for talking to Saul?” “I’m not sure,” Mia replied. “He’s saying the right things, but it’s such a cold, formal email, so I can’t help feeling that he sent it only because he got in trouble. Maybe going over Michael’s head was a mistake.”9 “Well, you’ve tried talking to Michael and didn’t get anywhere. And it’s clear he didn’t understand what Saul promised you, so they needed to have a conversation. Even if he’s saying all this under duress, at least he’s saying it.” “But can I trust him? Can I trust the organization? It has such a great reputation, but from the inside it seems like a mess.” Mateo hugged her. “You’ve never been the kind of person to settle,” he said. “If it’s that bad, maybe it’s time to cut your losses.” “And do what? I need a job.” “Of course. We rely on your income. But what did your boss say when you left Azzurro? She said you could always come back.” “Doesn’t everyone say that?” “No. They loved you there.” Mia smiled, but she was still conflicted. “I guess I could reach out to recruiters, too.” “See—you have options.” “I know. I need to think more about what I’m going to do.” “Well, I’m here to talk whenever you need to. I’ll support your decision.” IF YOU DON’T like your current situation, you have the power to change it. I would encourage Mia to actively start looking for another job. She needs to reframe her negative experience at Rescue as an opportunity to consider what will really make her happy. Does she want to be more involved in a career track that includes fieldwork? Is an office environment with natural light and standing desks (as opposed to a dark space filled with cubicles) important for her mental health? We already know she’s a marketable candidate. She was recruited and offered twice her salary to work at a respected nonprofit. And because she has a steady income, she has time to be strategic and consider other job options. Looking for a job is like a job in itself, but it will be worth it if Mia can find one better suited to her goals and personal needs. I experienced a similar situation. A few years ago I joined a prestigious news outlet. Like Rescue, it was a large organization with serious bureaucracy problems. Processes weren’t streamlined, and people needed approvals at many levels to get things done. This lack of agility meant that the organization struggled with employee development. As a result, my manager and I had different expectations regarding my role. Mia is facing the same thing. In a bureaucracy, without a supportive boss, it can take months, even years, for the situation to change. And Michael’s icy email implies that he already resents Mia for going over his head—a red flag that suggests he may not be open to change. Even if his reasons are justified, their relationship will probably continue to be emotionally exhausting for Mia. What Mia can control is how she reacts. She can think about what she’s looking for in a work environment and culture and outline where she wants to be in five to 10 years. She can update her résumé and craft a story to explain her short time at Rescue. I’d recommend that she tell an honest one: “I was recruited, but in the end there were some misalignments between the role I was told I’d be taking on and the work I was doing.” She doesn’t need to go into a lot of detail. I left the news outlet years ago and found a job at a much smaller company that was a better cultural fit. I was also given more leadership opportunities, which allowed me to launch my long-term career. Later on I learned that the structural problems at the news outlet ended up hurting the business because it couldn’t keep up with changing technologies. If Mia stays at Rescue, she risks spinning her wheels and halting her professional development. She needs to be a self-starter and put her happiness first. MIA SHOULD STICK with Rescue for a bit longer. She is only a month in and needs to give it more time. Change always comes with some challenges. I’d encourage her to revisit what originally drove her to take this role. First, the organization is very much more in alignment with her interest in humanitarian work than Azzurro was. And although she is understandably excited by the prospect of actually working in the field, she will soon learn how crucial internal support staff members like her are to making this work possible. Nonprofits today depend on strong data and analytics to remain competitive in their fields and to present valid, evidence-based reporting to their partners. Second, this role is more challenging than her previous one was. She is taking on new and different responsibilities, which naturally come with a period of discomfort. But that’s normal. At the end of the day, this job is going to stretch her in ways that her previous role didn’t. She will walk away with a much broader skill set in a field she is passionate about. Without putting the blame on anyone in particular, it appears that there were some failures in the interview process that have led to a misalignment between Mia’s expectations and Michael’s. It doesn’t seem to me that this is the result of poor leadership or an issue of organizational structure, either of which would be of greater concern. As written, Mia’s job description—setting up data systems and identifying key performance indicators—is a very internal one. If we could go back a month, I would caution her to take a closer look at what exactly she was being hired to do and to clarify her day-to-day responsibilities. For example, “Does identifying KPIs mean I’d be going into the field, or would that work take place in the office?” What Mia can do now is revisit that job description to see whether it matches the tasks she’s been assigned so far. Recruiters do sometimes make promises to expand roles when they are trying to draw in candidates. Since Mia was indeed promised fieldwork by Saul, Michael has a responsibility to follow through. When and how that will happen needs to be made clear. It’s a good sign that Michael addressed this issue head-on, even if he did so in an email. He may have been doing it grudgingly, but he seemed to be offering Mia an olive branch and a chance for the two of them to get on the same page. If Mia chooses to stick it out for at least six months, she can take small, proactive steps to improve her situation. It is Michael’s responsibility to make time for weekly check-ins, but it is Mia’s responsibility to set the agenda for those meetings. Before going into them, she should outline what she wants to discuss, including questions she has about upcoming projects and how to overcome challenges she may be facing. She needs to take the initiative to get guidance from Michael rather than waiting for him to offer it. Even if we weren’t in the midst of an economic downturn, I’d advise Mia to stay on for now. If she is still unhappy in the role after six months, maybe she does need to think about other possibilities. But she will walk away with a stronger résumé and a better skill set, which will position her to have more options."
"22",22,"https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue","communication.txt","Why do we find video calls so draining? In part, it’s because they force us to focus more intently on conversations in order to absorb information. They also require us to stare directly at a screen for minutes at a time without any visual or mental break, which is tiring. To make video calls less exhausting for yourself, try using a few research-based tips. First, avoid multitasking. It may be tempting to get other work done on a video call, but witching between tasks can cost you as much as 40 percent of your productive time. The next time you’re on a video chat, close any tabs or programs that might distract you, put your phone away, and stay present. Second, take mini breaks during longer calls by minimizing the video, moving it to behind your open applications, or just looking away from your computer now and then. Finally, check your calendar for the next few days to see if there are any conversations you could have over Slack or email instead. Especially in situations where you’re communicating with people outside of your organization, don’t feel obligated to send a Zoom link. Often, a phone call is more appropriate. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. If you’re finding that you’re more exhausted at the end of your workday than you used to be, you’re not alone. Over the past few weeks, mentions of “Zoom fatigue” have popped up more and more on social media, and Google searches for the same phrase have steadily increased since early March. Why do we find video calls so draining? There are a few reasons. In part, it’s because they force us to focus more intently on conversations in order to absorb information. Think of it this way: when you’re sitting in a conference room, you can rely on whispered side exchanges to catch you up if you get distracted or answer quick, clarifying questions. During a video call, however, it’s impossible to do this unless you use the private chat feature or awkwardly try to find a moment to unmute and ask a colleague to repeat themselves. The problem isn’t helped by the fact that video calls make it easier than ever to lose focus. We’ve all done it: decided that, why yes, we absolutely can listen intently, check our email, text a friend, and post a smiley face on Slack within the same thirty seconds. Except, of course, we don’t end up doing much listening at all when we’re distracted. Adding fuel to the fire is many of our work-from-home situations. We’re no longer just dialing into one or two virtual meetings. We’re also continuously finding polite new ways to ask our loved ones not to disturb us, or tuning them out as they army crawl across the floor to grab their headphones off the dining table. For those who don’t have a private space to work, it is especially challenging. Finally, “Zoom fatigue” stems from how we process information over video. On a video call the only way to show we’re paying attention is to look at the camera. But, in real life, how often do you stand within three feet of a colleague and stare at their face? Probably never. This is because having to engage in a “constant gaze” makes us uncomfortable — and tired. In person, we are able to use our peripheral vision to glance out the window or look at others in the room. On a video call, because we are all sitting in different homes, if we turn to look out the window, we worry it might seem like we’re not paying attention. Not to mention, most of us are also staring at a small window of ourselves, making us hyper-aware of every wrinkle, expression, and how it might be interpreted. Without the visual breaks we need to refocus, our brains grow fatigued. If this all sounds like bad news, don’t despair. We have five research-based tips that can help make video calls less exhausting. It’s easy to think that you can use the opportunity to do more in less time, but research shows that trying to do multiple things at once cuts into performance. Because you have to turn certain parts of your brain off and on for different types of work, switching between tasks can cost you as much as 40 percent of your productive time. Researchers at Stanford found that people who multitask can’t remember things as well as their more singularly focused peers. The next time you’re on a video chat, close any tabs or programs that might distract you (e.g. your inbox or Slack), put your phone away, and stay present. We know it’s tempting, but try to remind yourself that the Slack message you just got can wait 15 minutes, and that you’ll be able to craft a better response when you’re not also on a video chat. Take mini breaks from video during longer calls by minimizing the window, moving it to behind your open applications, or just looking away from your computer completely for a few seconds now and then. We’re all more used to being on video now (and to the stressors that come with nonstop facetime). Your colleagues probably understand more than you think — it is possible to listen without staring at the screen for a full thirty minutes. This is not an invitation to start doing something else, but to let your eyes rest for a moment. For days when you can’t avoid back-to-back calls, consider making meetings 25 or 50 minutes (instead of the standard half-hour and hour) to give yourself enough time in between to get up and move around for a bit. If you are on an hour-long video call, make it okay for people to turn off their cameras for parts of the call. Research shows that when you’re on video, you tend to spend the most time gazing at your own face. This can be easily avoided by hiding yourself from view. Still, onscreen distractions go far beyond yourself. You may be surprised to learn that on video, we not only focus on other’s faces, but on their backgrounds as well. If you’re on a call with five people, you may feel like you’re in five different rooms at once. You can see their furniture, plants, and wallpaper. You might even strain to see what books they have on their shelves. The brain has to process all of these visual environmental cues at the same time. To combat mental fatigue, encourage people to use plain backgrounds (e.g. a poster of a peaceful beach scene), or agree as a group to have everyone who is not talking turn off their video. After a long day of back-to-back video calls, it’s normal to feel drained, particularly if you’re an introvert. That’s why virtual social sessions should be kept opt-in, meaning whoever owns the event makes it explicit that people are welcome, but not obligated, to join. You might also consider appointing a facilitator if you’re expecting a large group. This person can open by asking a question, and then make it clear in what order people should speak, so everyone gets to hear from one another and the group doesn’t start talking all at once. It’s easy to get overwhelmed if we don’t know what’s expected of us, or if we’re constantly trying to figure out when we should or should not chime in. Check your calendar for the next few days to see if there are any conversations you could have over Slack or email instead. If 4PM rolls around and you’re Zoomed-out but have an upcoming one-on-one, ask the person to switch to a phone call or suggest picking up the conversation later so you can both recharge. Try something like, “I’d love a break from video calls. Do you mind if we do this over the phone?” Most likely the other person will be relieved by the switch, too. Many people now feel a tendency to treat video as the default for all communication. In situations where you’re communicating with people outside of your organization (clients, vendors, networking, etc.) — conversations for which you used to rely on phone calls — you may feel obligated to send out a Zoom link instead. But a video call is fairly intimate and can even feel invasive in some situations. For example, if you’re asked to do a career advice call and you don’t know the person you’re talking to, sticking to phone is often a safer choice. If your client FaceTimes you with no warning, it’s okay to decline and suggest a call instead. Some of these tips might be hard to follow at first (especially that one about resisting the urge to tab-surf during your next Zoom call). But taking these steps can help you prevent feeling so exhausted at the thought of another video chat. It’s tiring enough trying to adapt to this new normal.

"23",23,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/how-to-network-when-there-are-no-networking-events","communication.txt","Even though networking events have been canceled, there are still many ways for you to build professional relationships while working from home. The authors outline three strategies: 1) Turn canceled conferences into private networking opportunities. Identify participants who were supposed to attend or speak and choose 5-10 you’d like to connect with and send them a message on LinkedIn. 2) Rethink geographic boundaries. Organize virtual events and invite people you normally wouldn’t have because they weren’t local. 3) Invite senior leaders to your online working group meetings. A drop-by from a high-level leader may have been difficult, if not impossible, under normal circumstances — but with everyone working virtually (and the leader not traveling), a 15-minute appearance is often surprisingly easy to facilitate. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. We all know the typical ways to network: by attending industry mixers, business dinners, and conferences. But of course none of those have been possible over the past few months, with so much of the world in quarantine. And even as various regions start to open up, large gatherings will be slow to come back, and long-distance travel will be limited. How should you be making new professional connections during this time? And how can you strengthen relationships inside your company when many people are still working remotely? As executive coaches who work with leaders across the globe, we’ve spent years helping clients learn to build relationships virtually. As in the past, it’s still useful to deepen existing relationships and cultivate new ones by engaging on LinkedIn or other social media platforms. But in this unique time, we’ve identified several other strategies you can use to create connections. Here are three to consider. Since the pandemic began, many conferences and other large gatherings have been canceled, but even in their absence, you can use them as a way to meet people. Take a look at the conferences scheduled for earlier in the year along with those that would have been coming up. Identify participants who were supposed to attend or speak or who came in prior years. (If you don’t have the list, you can often email conference organizers and ask for it.) Choose five to 10 people you’d like to connect with, and find something you have in common that might make them interested in meeting you (for instance, you’re both involved in robotics research, or you’re alumni of the same university). You can email them or send a message on LinkedIn saying something like, “We were both planning to attend [conference] this year. I had been hoping to meet you there, because I saw that we’re both involved in robotics research and I thought it might be interesting to chat. Since the event was canceled and we’re all grounded for the moment, I thought I’d reach out virtually instead. Let me know if you’d like to meet for a coffee over Zoom.” One of Alisa’s clients, the CEO of a media company, employed this strategy. After a major conference he was planning to attend got canceled, he reached out to some of the people he had wanted to meet there and convened a virtual cocktail party. He developed relationships with interesting new contacts and was invited to speak at a future event. Before the world went remote, most professionals’ standard networking impulse was to focus on the people around them. We experienced this ourselves as hosts of regular dinner gatherings in New York City. When creating guest lists, we’d think about local colleagues and would tell out-of-town contacts to “let us know when you’re going to be in New York.” Now those boundaries have receded, and as we’ve shifted to virtual cocktail gatherings, we’ve realized that we’re free to invite people from around the world with whom we wouldn’t have previously been able to connect. During one recent Zoom networking event we brought together colleagues from Boston, New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Austin. We’ve noticed that our corporate coaching clients are applying the same principles and similarly taking a more expansive view. In the past, they might not have invited colleagues from different geographic regions to participate in a meeting if everyone else attending was in the same office. Now that so many of us are remote, they’re more comfortable inviting colleagues regardless of where they’re located. The current crisis has raised a host of new issues for business leaders to consider, whether it’s the future of your industry, how your company is responding to particular challenges (from supply chain to marketing to employee engagement), or the future of global work. This presents a unique opportunity for you to proactively convene an informal working group to discuss these issues. In some corporate cultures, you can simply invite a few people and have it grow from there. In others, it may be important to check in with your manager first. After gathering a group of peers a few times and establishing that the conversations are valuable, you can, where appropriate in your corporate culture, reach out to senior leaders and invite them to join a session, as either a participant or a guest speaker. A drop-by from a high-level leader may have been difficult, if not impossible, under normal circumstances — but with everyone working virtually (and the leader not traveling), a 15-minute appearance is often surprisingly easy to facilitate. One of Alisa’s clients is the CHRO of the U.S. division of a Fortune 500 company. In the early days of the pandemic, she took the initiative to convene a regular call with her peers in other geographies. As the crisis has played out, she has invited multiple company leaders, including the global CEO, to take part. That got her onto his radar, and he now calls her personally to discuss how the various regions are doing. Even though networking events have been canceled, there are many ways for you to build professional relationships. By employing these three strategies, you’ll emerge even stronger once in-person events start up again.

"24",24,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/tame-your-inbox-like-an-er-doctor","communication.txt","As the Covid-19 crisis has intensified there has been a related parallel surge that poses a real threat to communication in the crisis — an explosion of critical emails. This creates a real risk that important information might get lost, stalled, or fail to reach the right people, and that the sheer volume and density of expanding threads could distract people from their essential work. To address the threat, apply crisis resource management principles familiar to every emergency physician. As the Covid-19 crisis intensified in New York City there was a related parallel surge that posed a real threat to communication in the crisis — an explosion of critical email that at first exceeded our capacity to keep up. There was a real risk that important information would get lost, stalled, or fail to reach the right people, and that the sheer volume and density of expanding threads would distract people from their essential work. To address the threat, we applied crisis resource management (CRM) principles familiar to every emergency physician. CRM, derived from crew resource management — an aviation safety protocol — is a method for managing teamwork during a resuscitation or other medical emergency, with effective communication at its core. As emergency physicians, we are trained to apply CRM principles in balancing the workload in a busy emergency department (ED), prioritizing tasks, ignoring distractions, navigating uncertainty, and relentlessly solving complex problems. The exact choreography of care changes depending on the patient volume and severity, with different tempos for patients arriving via ambulance or from mass-casualty events. We realized that managing the flood of crisis-related email needed to be similarly choreographed. Of course, some argue against using email in general, in favor of more nimble communication modalities such as Slack, BAND, WhatsApp, or team sites. But the reality is that during the Covid-19 crisis communication flooded in through every door, window, inbox, and app it could find. Email in hospitals remains largely the dominant form of digital communication; it can’t be ignored, but it can be tamed. Here’s how we have applied CRM communication principles to effectively manage email communication in during the crisis. A team of experts is not the same as an expert team. Having many leaders in a resuscitation room creates cacophony and makes it difficult for a team to focus and prioritize tasks. During the crisis, many well-intentioned leaders from various pillars of the organization composed daily emails with important but oft redundant updates — and the sheer volume of information made it nearly impossible to absorb during busy clinical shifts and other duties. Early in the response we designated a single person to serve as the department email summarizer who would synthesize this daily deluge into a more digestible and consistent format sent at the same time each day. The subject line, format, and section headings were all standardized to reduce cognitive load and focus limited attention on the rapidly changing protocols for testing, clinical care pathways, personal protective equipment availability, and wellbeing initiatives. Clearly stating the title and roles of people on each email was another important step. Consistently including this information spares people the trouble of decoding who the recipients are and why they’re on the thread and assures that everyone on an expanding team is aware of each other’s roles. For instance, when adding Dr. Romney to the cc line, the sender would include the note “+Dr. Romney, Vice Chair of Quality, as she is overseeing mortality reviews.” Soliciting this information from other senders, though possibly awkward, helps all recipients get on the same page and can help later in dispersing the crowd and keeping the focus on action-oriented teams. For example, when somebody was included solely for situational-awareness purposes, they could later be “moved to the bcc line to spare their inbox,” (language that explains their departure) allowing them to see that the team is moving forward while excluding them from subsequent group messages once their role in decision making is achieved. In the resuscitation bay there is no room for vague requests. “Thin-air” statements or “asking the room” refers to requests that are not directed at an individual, such as “can somebody please get me a scalpel.” In the ED, directly asking a person by name to do a specific task provokes a faster response and is more likely to evoke vital additional information (“we’re out of scalpels!”). Similarly, when you’re sending emails during a crisis, avoid the passive voice, clearly direct requests to specific individuals and provide concrete timelines and instructions on how to report back when the action is complete, to close the loop. Email is commonly abused as a tool for putting work on somebody else’s desk without having to confirm that they can take it on. During a crisis it is essential that the person initiating an email solicit a closed-loop response that the message has been received, that the delegated party can complete the action, and that he or she will reply again when the job is done. The subject line can be used like a step-stool the leader stands on to get more attention during a code. Noting action requests in the subject line with open and closed brackets can help readers to prioritize the message.  For example, “Subject: [Response requested by end of day] re: Status of mask delivery.” Once teams are familiar with a common language they can shift to shorthand (e.g., AR = action requested, or EOD = end of day). In a crisis, people’s reflex is to add recipients to an email thread to assure that everyone is on the same page. This can be important, but for the recipient brought into a conversation midstream, it can be time-consuming to piece together what’s going on. Sometimes, after spending several minutes reading and re-reading a lengthy email, the intent of the message and your role remains a mystery. In the ED, when a new member joins a resuscitation in progress, a standard CRM practice is to give them a recap. For example, “This is a 40-year-old male brought in cardiac arrest following a motor vehicle crash. We are on our third round of epinephrine.” When you’re copied onto a chain, rather than spend time reading long threads to reconstruct the narrative simply ask for clarification: “Sorry, long email sent, can you please clarify why I’m added now and how I can help?” The ultimate team goal during any resuscitation is to rapidly adopt a shared mental model of the situation. This assures that everyone understands each other’s roles, the patient’s status from moment to moment, and what needs to be done. With several people working simultaneously and focusing intensively on one problem (say a sudden heart arrhythmia), “task fixation” can occur causing the team to miss something else that’s also urgent (like a blocked breathing tube). To assure that the team avoids task fixation and maintains broad situational awareness in a resuscitation, emergency team huddles often start with a call for quiet in the room followed by a concise game plan and clear instruction about roles, including hand offs. Crisis emails can adopt a similar strategy. To avoid unnecessary noise in an email, explicitly state who you want to hear from and who you don’t (“please don’t reply unless…”). A communications technique called SBAR (for “situation, background, assessment, and recommendation”) facilitates efficient communication and hand-offs during an acute events, and can be usefully applied to email. As our emergency department responded to the escalating Covid crisis, using this format in emails with other departments helped keep communication concise and focused on outcomes. Comments buried in the body of a message are the equivalent of mumbling during a resuscitation; if you have something important to say, bring it to the top and say it loudly with an SBAR. For example, “Situation: Face mask shortage. Background: Last weekend we ran out of face masks on Saturday. Assessment: We need a strategy to ensure weekend supply chain is maintained. Recommendation: Can we either get extra supply on Friday or have a facilities contact that our administrator on call can escalate directly to this weekend if supply runs short again?” Communication in a crisis relies on team members feeling a sense of psychological safety — that they are free to speak openly without fear of repercussion. In the ED, we expect team members to speak up, especially to prevent a mistakes such as a medication error. But evidence shows that unless team members feel safe speaking openly, even vital information like this is often suppressed. Email can be a particular challenge in this regard; it is notoriously poor at conveying tone and so people may feel even less comfortable speaking up as it can be harder to convey the context and spirit in which a comment is made. Acknowledging this at the outset, especially when speaking frankly in email about a concern or problem, will help to provide context and foster an open exchange. Psychological safety is a fragile construct that requires constant nurturing. Remember that unlike in a trauma room, you can still communicate one-on-one via emails, and some replies may be best done individually if there is any risk of somebody feeling they are being publicly reprimanded or embarrassed through reply-all. Just as in the emergency department, the more this communication script is rehearsed and incorporated into the work culture, the safer members will feel sharing information. As a leader, one way to facilitate this via email is to amplify a recommendation made by a junior team member that hasn’t yet been acknowledged. For example, “Andre asked an important question about staff safety. Myriam, what are your thoughts on this?” *** It is time to resuscitate our inboxes. Though there is still a lot to learn as a community about how to communicate with each other during a crisis, developing more standardized formats for email communication will help to build a culture of productive discourse using this medium. Establishing a single point of information delivery and avoiding use of inbox except for communication and tracking of action items can help us focus critical email resources on addressing the topics that need the most attention. Leverage the skills of CRM like an ED doc to tame your inbox and communicate effectively during a crisis."

Humor is widely considered essential in personal relationships, but in leaders, it’s seen as an ancillary behavior. Though some leaders use humor instinctively, many more could wield it purposefully. Humor helps build interpersonal trust and high-quality work relationships and influences behaviors and attitudes that matter to leadership effectiveness, including employee performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and creativity. These benefits don’t come without potential costs. The guidelines in this article suggest ways to capture the benefits of humor while avoiding the downside risks. A few years ago, we conducted a  research study in which we asked people to help us create an ad campaign for a travel service called VisitSwitzerland.ch (which we’d made up). We put the participants into small groups and showed them a photo—a Swiss landscape of a lake, a mountain, and the country’s distinctive flag with its white plus sign against a red background—accompanied by the question: “What made you fall in love with Switzerland?” We gave participants three minutes to come up with a memorable answer and then had them share their ideas with their groups.   In each presentation, we had two people (who were working with us) share first, using scripts we’d written for them. The first presenter offered a straightforward statement extolling Switzerland: “The country is beautiful. The scenery is truly breathtaking!” The second presenter alternated his approach. In half the presentations he said, “The mountains are great for skiing and hiking! It’s amazing!” In the other half, he added a pun: “The mountains are great for skiing and hiking, and the flag is a big plus! Seriously, it’s amazing!” Admittedly, that isn’t the world’s funniest joke. But we used it to test a simple question: Can one joke make a meaningful difference in how people are viewed by others? In our study, the answer was unequivocally yes. Participants who heard the second presenter make the joke rated him as more confident and more competent than those who heard his joke-free delivery. The jokey presenter was also more likely to be voted as the leader for subsequent group tasks. That’s not a bad payoff for one barely funny attempt at humor. This finding may not be surprising—many of us intuit that humor matters. Ask your colleagues what characteristics they value in a friend or a romantic partner, and they are likely to tell you (among other things), “a sense of humor,” “someone who makes me laugh,” or “someone who laughs at my jokes.” But ask the same people what traits they value in a leader, and odds are that humor will not top the list. We tend to view humor as an ancillary leadership behavior. In fact, it’s a powerful tool that some people use instinctively but more could wield purposefully. One good laugh—or better still, a workplace culture that encourages levity—facilitates interpersonal communication and builds social cohesion. Analysis of large sets of workplace communications suggests that humor occurs in at least 10% of emails and is slightly more likely to be used by leaders in face-to-face interactions. But these numbers can (and should) be larger. Research by us and others has shown that humor can influence and reinforce status hierarchies in groups, build interpersonal trust and high-quality work relationships, and fundamentally shape the way people perceive one another’s confidence, competence, warmth, and clarity of communication. It also influences critical behaviors and attitudes that matter to leadership effectiveness, including employee job performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, citizenship behaviors, creativity, psychological safety in groups, and desire to interact again in the future. However, jokes that fall flat (they’re not funny, or no one laughs) or are offensive (they’re viewed as inappropriate for the context) can harm professional standing by making a joke teller appear less intelligent and less competent. They can lower status and in extreme cases cost people their jobs. One good laugh—or better still, a workplace that encourages levity—builds cohesion. In this article, we offer guidance on how to use specific types of humor to become a more effective leader—and how to avoid being the cautionary tale at your company’s next HR training seminar. Humor and laughter are intricately tied to status and power. People in lower ranks who wield them well can climb the status hierarchy in their departments and organizations. As we saw in the Swiss advertising study (conducted with our colleague Maurice Schweitzer of the Wharton School), individuals who make funny and appropriate jokes are more likely to be nominated for leadership positions by their peers. In the same research project, we ran an experiment in which we asked people to recall moments when a colleague was funny. We found the link between humor and status to be so powerful that merely prompting individuals to recall a humorous exchange with a coworker shifted their perceptions of the coworker’s status. Humor not only helps individuals ascend to positions of authority but also helps them lead more effectively once they are there. Professors Cecily Cooper (University of Miami), Tony Kong (University of South Florida), and Craig Crossley (University of Central Florida) found that when leaders used humor as an interpersonal tool, their employees were happier, which fostered better communication and resulted in an uptick in citizenship behaviors—voluntary actions that facilitate organizational effectiveness. That is, when leaders used humor, their employees were more likely to go above and beyond the call of duty. Why is humor so powerful? In a study to understand what makes things funny, researchers Caleb Warren (University of Arizona) and Peter McGraw (University of Colorado at Boulder) found that humor most often occurs when something is perceived as a benign violation. They conducted studies in which participants were presented with scenarios depicting someone doing something that was benign (for example, a pole-vaulter successfully completing a jump), a violation (a pole-vaulter failing a jump and getting seriously injured), or both (a pole-vaulter failing a jump but not getting seriously injured). Participants who saw the third kind of scenario (simultaneously a violation and benign) were more likely to laugh than those who saw the scenarios that were either strictly benign or strictly violations. Things strike us as funny, the researchers concluded, when they make us uncomfortable but do so in a way that is acceptable or not overly threatening. Because telling jokes that violate our psychological safety can be seen as risky, it can make people appear more confident and more competent. In one of our studies, we found that regardless of whether a joke was considered successful or inappropriate, participants viewed joke tellers as more confident—because they had the courage to attempt a joke at all. Projecting confidence in this way leads to higher status (provided the audience has no information that suggests a lack of competence). We also found that people who violate expectations and norms in a socially appropriate way are seen as more competent and more intelligent. This finding confirms our feelings about funny conversationalists: We admire and respect their wit, which raises their prestige. But the violating nature of humor is also what makes it risky. Jokes that go too far over the line of appropriateness have the opposite effect—an “eeeek” reaction. Rather than thinking that the joke teller is intelligent and competent, observers think, What an idiot or I can’t believe he just said that. Although tellers of inappropriate jokes are still seen as confident, the low competence signaled by unsuccessful attempts at humor can lead to a loss of status. In fact, our research confirms that failed humor is quite costly for leaders, making them even worse off than serious, humorless leaders who don’t attempt jokes at all. Finding the balance between a benign violation and an extreme violation can be tricky—even professional comedians routinely face criticism for overstepping—and it takes skill to get it right. When we converse with others, we need to balance multiple motives simultaneously. We may aim to exchange information clearly and accurately, make a positive impression on one another, navigate conflict, have fun, and so on. The degree to which each motive is viewed as normative and socially acceptable varies from setting to setting. That’s why context is so important when it comes to humor. It’s probably safer to tell your funny story about the horrible hotel service you experienced abroad to your friends at a dinner party (where the normative motive is enjoyment) than to a border patrol agent as you are reentering the country (where the normative motive is information exchange). A certain joke may work dazzlingly well with one group of people but completely flop with another—or even with the same group in a different context. And although jokes generally function as (well-intended) social glue, they may have the opposite effect if they’re perceived as thinly veiled brags or as insulting to specific people or ideas. Here are ways to capture the benefits of humor while avoiding the contextual risks. This form of humor happens anytime an outsider doesn’t have the background information needed to get the joke. Inside jokes are extremely common—our data suggests that almost everyone has engaged in or witnessed one. But how does insider talk, especially inside jokes, affect the dynamics within a group? In collaboration with Ovul Sezer (University of North Carolina), Maurice Schweitzer, and Michael Norton (Harvard Business School), we conducted a study to understand those effects. We asked people to engage in a brainstorming task on instant messenger. Each participant was teamed up with two of our research assistants posing as fellow participants. In one condition, one researcher sent a message to the team that the participant couldn’t read (it looked like garbled text), and then the other researcher sent a response: “I agree!” This made the participant think that the other two had exchanged information that he or she was not privy to. In the other condition, the second researcher responded to the garbled message with, “Hahaha, that’s hilarious, I agree!” It was a subtle difference—in both conditions, participants were on the outside. Did it matter whether what they missed was funny? Yes. Participants were more likely to believe that their partners thought of themselves as superior in the inside-joke condition than in the inside-information condition, and they reported lower group identification and cohesion when the secret exchange involved a joke. Adam Voorhes/Gallery Stock We’ve all experienced this phenomenon firsthand. Although levity is typically thought of as a behavior that binds people together, it can draw fault lines in a group, making some people feel awkward and excluded. Inside jokes have their place, of course. They can signal closeness or camaraderie, making people feel pleased to be in the loop. This kind of humor can be useful in transactional or nonconsequential situations when it doesn’t matter much if an outsider doesn’t get it. But the research on this kind of humor is clear: When group cohesion is important, tell jokes that everyone can understand. Despite the fact that you’re soooo good at using sarcasm, a little more guidance won’t hurt. Research by Li Huang (INSEAD), Francesca Gino (Harvard), and Adam Galinsky (Columbia) reveals that sarcasm is not just for teenagers trying to irritate their parents; it can be useful for managers and teams as well. In their study, participants either made or received sarcastic comments or made or received sincere ones. Participants in the sarcasm condition were significantly more likely to solve a creativity task assigned later in the experiment than those in the sincere condition. In a subsequent study, participants were asked to merely recall a time when they either said or heard something sarcastic or a time they said or heard something sincere. Once again, creativity on the subsequent task was higher in the sarcasm condition. Why does this happen? Sarcasm involves saying one thing and meaning the opposite, so using and interpreting it requires higher-level abstract thinking (compared with straightforward statements), which boosts creativity. The downside is that sarcasm can produce higher levels of perceived conflict, particularly when trust is low between the expresser and the recipient. And because sarcasm involves saying the opposite of what you mean, there’s a risk of misunderstanding or worse if the recipient does not pick up on the humorous intent and takes a sarcastic comment literally. The lesson: Unleash your sarcastic side to get creative juices flowing—but tone it down with new colleagues, in unfamiliar settings, or when working in teams where strong relationships haven’t yet been built. Until you’ve established trust, it’s best to communicate with respect. During his presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy faced accusations that his wealthy father was attempting to buy the election. At the 1958 Gridiron dinner, Kennedy addressed those accusations by saying, “I just received the following wire from my generous daddy: ‘Dear Jack, don’t buy a single vote more than is necessary. I’ll be damned if I’m going to pay for a landslide.’” Self-deprecating humor can be an effective method of neutralizing negative information about oneself. Research by one of us (Brad) and Maurice Schweitzer found that individuals are seen as warmer and more competent when they disclose negative information about themselves using humor than when they disclose it in a serious manner. When they add humor to a disclosure, counterparts view the negative information as less true and less important. For example, the study found that job candidates who revealed their limited math ability in a humorous manner (“I can add and subtract, but geometry is where I draw the line”) were perceived as better able to do math than those who disclosed the information in a serious manner (“I can add and subtract, but I struggle with geometry”). There are limits to the benefits of self-deprecating humor, however. Among lower-status people it can backfire if the trait or skill in question is an essential area of competence. For instance, a statistician can more safely make self-deprecating jokes about her spelling than about her statistical skills. So when discussing core competences, another form of humor might serve the purpose better. (An exception worth mentioning is when being self-deprecating about a core competence is the only alternative to disclosing the information in a serious way.) You should also avoid using humor to reveal your failures in situations where levity would be seen as inappropriate (such as if you are testifying in court) or when the failure is perceived as so serious that joking about it would be in poor taste. At the 2004 White House Correspondent’s Dinner, for example, President George W. Bush showed a video in which he was searching around the Oval Office and saying, “Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere. Nope, no weapons over there…maybe under here?” The topic was too consequential for jokes, and the video generated harsh criticism. In the second of two debates during the 1984 U.S. presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan, the incumbent, was asked if his age would impede his ability to do the job in a second term. At age 73, Reagan was already the oldest president in American history, and he was perceived as being fatigued during the first debate. The president responded by saying, “I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” The audience, along with Reagan’s opponent, Walter Mondale, erupted in laughter. Mondale later said it was the moment he knew he had lost the election. Few people enjoy being asked difficult questions like the one posed to Reagan. Previous research has revealed a range of ways people can respond: by staying silent, explicitly lying, paltering (saying truthful things to deliberately mislead), or responding with another question. Using humor to dodge a question is another option that can be quite helpful in certain situations. That’s because humor is cognitively distracting, according to research by Madelijn Strick (Utrecht University) and colleagues. Just as a good magician gets the audience to look away from the sleight of hand, a successful joke can turn our attention away from certain information. Successful humor also makes us happy, and we are more likely to trust people when we are in a good mood. And as we have mentioned, funny people are seen as more intelligent and skilled. Part of the reason Reagan’s response was so effective was that his mental ability was under attack. By responding with humor (even with a scripted line he had probably rehearsed), Reagan signaled to the audience that he was still mentally sharp. During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was angered when General George B. McClellan failed to attack General Robert E. Lee in Richmond. Lincoln addressed the issue in a letter to McClellan saying, “If you don’t want to use the army, I should like to borrow it for a while. Yours respectfully, A. Lincoln.” Using humor to deliver negative feedback, as Lincoln did, can make criticism more memorable. Delivering negative feedback can be challenging, so it may be tempting to fall back on a joke to lighten the mood. However, couching criticism in the form of a joke can lessen its impact. Peter McGraw and colleagues ran experiments in which participants reviewed complaints that were made in either a humorous or a serious manner. Although humorous complaints were better received than serious ones, they were also seen as more benign, and people felt less compelled to take action to rectify the problem. Because accompanying criticism with humor softens the feedback, it detracts from getting the point across when the issue is not obvious. If a manager jokes about a subordinate’s slipping performance, the employee may think either that his performance hasn’t been slipping or that the situation isn’t a big deal. If it were, why would she be joking about it? Do you remember the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election? For Donald Trump supporters, it was a happy day; for Hillary Clinton supporters, not so much. We took that opportunity to study how humor might help people cope with negative news. The day after the election, one of us (Alison) and several collaborators asked people who had voted for Clinton to write either something humorous or something meaningful about Trump’s victory. Those who sought humor in the situation felt better about it in the moment—and they still felt better about it when the researchers checked back in with them months later. Humor can be an extremely powerful coping tool, in even the toughest of circumstances. Leadership consultant Linda Henman found that American prisoners of war in Vietnam frequently used it to deal with the tough conditions they experienced. Strick and colleagues conducted studies in which they presented participants with photos of negative scenes (such as a physical assault or a car crash), followed by either a funny stimulus or a positive but not funny stimulus. Participants presented with the funny stimulus reported fewer negative emotions than did participants presented with the nonhumorous one. Why? Again, the cognitively demanding aspect of humor distracts people, leaving them less able to focus on negative information. Other research, however, revealed that the type of humor matters. One study by Andrea Samson (University of Fribourg) and James Gross (Stanford) found that positive, good-natured humor in response to bad news made people feel better, but negative, dark, or mean-spirited jokes made them feel worse. It’s also important to be careful about offending others with jokes when a situation is ongoing or recent (“too soon”). There are no hard-and-fast rules about when it’s safe or appropriate to tell a joke, but these general guidelines can help you use humor successfully at work. Use inside jokes when you’re not worried that individuals who don’t get the joke will feel ostracized.Avoid inside jokes when you care about group cohesion and not everyone is in the loop. Use sarcasm when you’re trying to boost creativity in a group of people you know well and trust.Avoid sarcasm when you’re trying to build relationships or when you want to avoid interpersonal conflict. Use self-deprecation when you’re joking about a nonessential trait or skill or you have to disclose negative information about your competence and your only other option is to do so in a serious way.Avoid self-deprecation when you’re discussing a core skill for your job or have not yet established widespread trust in your competence. Use humor to dodge difficult questions when you’re confident the audience will view your response as funny and you have a more serious answer if you’re pressed on the question.Avoid humor to dodge difficult questions when you don’t have a sense of the audience and you’re not highly confident the joke will land. Use humor to deliver negative feedback when you want to increase the odds that the recipient will remember the feedback.Don’t use humor to deliver negative feedback when there’s a chance the recipient will underestimate the urgency or importance of the message. Use humor as a coping mechanism when you’re close with the members of a group going through something difficult.Don’t use humor as a coping mechanism when the situation is ongoing or recent (“too soon”) or you risk being perceived as callous. Use humor whenever you can, cognizant of your relationships with the people listening and the norms of different environments. But in general, humor can be tremendously useful in helping people cope not only during or immediately after a negative event but also over the long term. In other studies Samson and Gross conducted with Alana Glassco (Twitter) and Ihno Lee (Uplight), participants who created funny responses to negative stimuli (such as responding to a photo of a man with facial stitches with, “Now he has a great zombie costume for Halloween!”) reported higher positive affect a week later when they were shown the negative pictures again. So the next time you receive bad news at work (slow sales or a botched launch), think about ways to laugh about it (“At least we don’t have to worry about stockouts” or “I’ve been stress eating so much it’s a shame my portfolio isn’t tracking my waistline”), even if you don’t say them out loud. As comedian Stephen Colbert observes, “You can’t laugh and be afraid at the same time—of anything. If you’re laughing, I defy you to be afraid.” Just as you don’t need to be Phil Mickelson to do well at the company golf outing, you don’t need to be Amy Schumer, Ali Wong, or John Mulaney to use humor well in the office. If anything, following the style or content of many professional comedians—who are expected to push the boundaries of appropriateness—would be dangerous in most workplaces. A joke’s success depends on who’s telling it, where and when it is told, and to whom, so everyone should use caution when attempting to retell a comedian’s jokes at work. The good news is that your colleagues are not expecting you to be as edgy (or as funny) as the professionals—or even to tell planned jokes at all. When you think about humor as a tool of leadership, recognize that people can be funny in a variety of ways. For example, witty conversationalists differ from elaborate storytellers, clever emailers, and rollicking presenters. Each of these types of humor requires a different response time, unique delivery pacing, and an understanding of the audience. If you’re uncomfortable making jokes in a large group or during a presentation, stick to using humor in one-on-one conversations. If you tend to be more serious when talking one-on-one, you might try sending funnier emails. Options for incorporating more humor into your work life abound. Humor at work is a delicate dance, and humor research is still in its infancy. Scholars (including us) are gaining data-driven descriptions of how people use various kinds of humor, and of when it works and when it doesn’t. But any rules of thumb for using humor have to include a caveat: Context matters. Conversational dynamics can vary profoundly from culture to culture, person to person, and group to group. These factors are tricky to navigate and make it difficult—even in the moment—to know whether your humor attempt has been successful or not. Many people will laugh politely even if something isn’t funny or is in poor taste, creating an unreliable feedback loop. If you don’t think you can land jokes at work, or you’re too nervous to try, that’s OK. Not everyone is meant to be funny, just as not every attempt at humor will be successful. (Even professional comedians have bits that bomb.) But you can still incorporate levity into your work life by doing something simple: appreciating other people’s humor. Be quick to laugh and smile. Delight in the absurdity of life and in the jokes you hear. A life devoid of humor is not only less joyful—it’s also less productive and less creative, for you and for those around you. Abundant benefits await those who view humor not as an ancillary organizational behavior but as a central path to status and flourishing at work."
"26",26,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-to-brief-a-senior-executive","leadership.txt","You can always count on outside circumstances to affect your pitch to a senior leader, so prepare to get your point across under pressure by understanding the interpersonal dynamics at play in advance. What are your boss’s “tells”? How do they engage with material? And whom do they look to for endorsement? Knowing these things ahead of time will help you react effectively to pushback and pivot when necessary while you’re in the room, either in person or virtually. Briefing a senior executive is an art and adept White House staffers do it every day under the most stressful of circumstances. They’re masters of compressing the right information into the right amount of time, no matter how complex the topic or short the briefing. The skills needed to brief the chief executive in the Oval Office are directly applicable to briefing any executive in the C-suite. There’s no shortage of advice on how to brief a senior leader: keep it short, front-load the message, and so on. These are solid pointers, but they undervalue the interpersonal elements that are critical to a successful briefing. Your presentation can fail or succeed before it begins and your odds are worse if you skimp on the personal in favor of the PowerPoint. The following tips are based on battle scars from serving twice in the White House and from years of briefing senior corporate, nonprofit, and government leaders, as well as teaching briefing skills in seminars around the country. They’re important whether the briefings take place in person or virtually. Identify the “crucial nodder.” At a critical moment in the briefing, the president will turn to a trusted advisor and look for a facial expression to affirm what you’re saying. You need that person to nod “yes.” It’s a quiet gesture that gives the boss comfort; it shows that your idea is sound and all of the right people have been consulted. Anything short of a supportive nod will invite follow-up questions and sow doubt in the room. Even worse, a look askance or a non-endorsement from a chief advisor can spell the quick death of your pitch. Before you present your idea, figure out who the crucial nodders are (it may be multiple people and it may vary based on the issue) and consult them in advance. While the executive you’re briefing may not have a crucial nodder, chances are they do have people whose opinions they trust more than others. You need their support — or at least a sense from them that you’re facing an uphill battle. Know your boss’s “tells.” If you spend a lot of time with the senior executive, then you should know the nonverbal cues that indicate things like “go deeper on that point” or “speed it up.” If not, seek out people who regularly brief and interact with them. Ask what to look for to know if the boss is annoyed and whether there’s any way to determine if it’s because of something you’re saying or if it’s unrelated. Also ask how best to respond to negative signals to try to shift the mood. Advance understanding of your boss’s body language will help you keep your cool and pivot in the right direction during the briefing. Find out how the boss engages with the material. People vary in how they react to and absorb information. A senior leader I briefed in the White House would question and push back (hard) on every point, large or small, in every briefing. Some colleagues found this intimidating and eventually turned into “yes” people and lost his respect. Other people jumped into a fight every time; they appeared closed minded and agitated him. The colleagues who earned this leader’s respect were the ones who picked their battles wisely. They went with the “yes” where they could and judiciously pushed back when it counted most, showing flexibility but also confidence in their views. If you go in with an awareness of a leader’s engagement style, you’ll be better prepared to effectively convey information and respond to pushback. Plan for gradations of success and failure. Of course, you should identify what you need from a meeting before walking in the door. But here’s a twist: Don’t think of it in binary terms of success and failure. Walk into the meeting with your “ask” but also with contingency plans for multiple scenarios of success and failure. If the conversation is trending toward “no,” you can offer a scaled-back version of your proposal. Likewise, if your idea is succeeding, have some additional ideas for add-ons or offer ways to accelerate the timetable. In short, think of how you can achieve a limited victory instead of a complete failure, keep an idea alive to fight another day, or, in the best case scenario, go bigger and faster in implementation. Read the room, not your notes. Whether the briefing is in person or virtual, you need to read cues and body language. You should know your material cold by this point so that you’re not fumbling with your notes; your mental energy should be focused on reading the room, looking for openings, and watching out for pitfalls. If there’s a corollary to this rule, it’s “take cues, not notes.” (In fact, when possible, have someone else take notes so you can be fully in the moment.) Stay laser focused on your task. Time pressure, competing interests, and unforeseen circumstances can threaten to pull you off task during the meeting, but don’t lose focus. Your ask is your priority and why you’re there, so dedicate all of your mental energy to looking for opportunities to advance it. If the conversation gets off track, a question causes the meeting to digress, or someone starts to rant about a pet topic, pre-plan several ways to redirect the conversation and get what you need. It’s a rare talent to be dogged but deft at the same time, and of course, you don’t want to look like a stiff or a robot. In a fast-paced work environment, though, meetings often get interrupted or cut short. Try not to deviate or raise unnecessary details to reduce the chance that a briefing will be interrupted before your ask is addressed. Practice the art of staying silent. You’ve floated your idea or posed your question. The discussion has taken off and now you need to be exceedingly strategic about whether and when to chime in. The executive is engaging others in the room or thinking aloud. By speaking at the wrong moment, you risk derailing the line of thought or annoying your boss. There’s no need to unnecessarily affirm something said or show off your knowledge. Alternatively, if the discussion is trending against you, take your best shot — rather than all the shots — at jumping in to try to get things back on track. Often, not speaking at the wrong time is just as important as saying the right thing at the right time. No matter how well you prepare, circumstances beyond your control, from an unrelated crisis to the boss’s stress level that day, will affect your pitch. While you cannot guarantee success, focusing on the interpersonal dynamics ahead of time and improving your situational awareness once in the room will make you more effective. You’ll be better placed to communicate the right message under pressure, whether you’re briefing the president of the United States, a C-suite executive, or any leader."
"27",27,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/self-compassion-will-make-you-a-better-leader","leadership.txt","When times are tough and you’re faced with hard decisions, it’s easy to get paralyzed by self-doubt and fear. To move to clarity and action, leaders need self-compassion. Research shows that it increases your levels of emotional intelligence, resilience, integrity, and makes you more compassionate toward others, all of which improves your effectiveness as a leader. The authors offer several exercises for cultivating this skill, from short daily practices to tactics that help you shift your mindset. It’s understandable for leaders to get caught up in fear, doubt, and criticism when facing critical business decisions that will have a major impact on lives and livelihoods. But what’s needed in times of uncertainty and disruption is mental clarity, emotional balance, fortitude, and vision. To move from self-doubt and paralysis to clarity and action, you need an often-misunderstood skill: self-compassion. Based on our experience training tens of thousands of leaders on the role of self-compassion in emotional intelligence and effective leadership, we’d like to share some key tips and techniques for cultivating this critical skill. First, it’s useful to accurately understand self-compassion. Put simply, it means taking a perspective toward yourself as you would with a friend or colleague who is facing a setback or challenge. It’s skill that is simple, but it’s surprisingly difficult for many of us. According to Kristen Neff, one of the leading researchers on the subject, there are three core elements to self-compassion: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Many mistakenly avoid self-compassion, believing that it means being easy on yourself and will lead to being complacent. But self-compassion in fact is the foundation for resilience and helps you develop the courage to face hard facts. In taking a constructive — rather than critical or harsh — attitude toward your efforts as a leader, you build your capacity to navigate challenges and unpredictability. The amount of research on self-compassion has grown significantly over the past fifteen years, and studies show that the benefits align with several important leadership skills. Emotional Intelligence: Studies indicate that people who exercise self-compassion have higher levels of emotional intelligence, are better able to maintain calm when flustered, and tend to experience more happiness and optimism. Resilience: Kristin Neff’s research and that of others shows that self-compassionate people have standards as high as people who lack self-compassion, but that those with high self-compassion are less likely to be unduly and unproductively hard on themselves if they didn’t meet their own standards. Self-compassion supports you as you navigate setbacks, regain clarity, and move forward productively. Growth Mindset: Studies from Neff and colleagues indicate that highly self-compassionate people are more oriented toward personal growth. Rather than avoid challenges, they are more likely to formulate specific plans to reach their goals. Integrity: Research shows a strong link between self-compassion and conscientiousness and accountability, suggesting that self-compassion enables leaders to act responsibly and morally, even when undertaking difficult decisions. Compassion Toward Others: As the UC-Berkeley professor of psychology Serena Chen writes, “Self-compassion and compassion for others are linked… Being kind and nonjudgmental toward the self is good practice for treating others compassionately.” Leaders who are able to model compassion for themselves and others build trust and psychological safety that leads to higher engagement and sustainable high performance in teams and organizations. Embracing the benefits of self-compassion is the first step. Then the question is how to foster it. Here is a set of core practices to get you started. Practice in the Moment The easiest place to start is with a five- to 20-second exercise that can be integrated into your day: when starting a meeting, as you sit down at your desk or kitchen table, or even while pausing between responding to emails. To practice self-compassion during these moments, take three deep breaths and with each breath, think three subsequent thoughts, each connected to one of the core elements of self-compassion: This short practice can be done quickly and unobtrusively, without anyone else even knowing. Rewire Your Brain In addition to short, in-the-moment practices, we recommend building your capacity with slightly longer practices as well. Spending somewhere between five and 10 minutes each day meditating on self-compassion will make a big difference. As we know from research on neuroplasticity, what we think and pay attention to changes the structures and functions of our brain to make these habits easier. By dedicating time regularly to build the capacity for self-compassion, we’re training the brain to incline towards self-kindness, making it an easier and more habitual response when things are tough. You can make a guided meditation (you might try this nine-minute one) part of your morning routine or integrate it into a lunch break or the end of your work day. If you notice there are moments throughout the day when you’re beating yourself up, you can try a shorter meditation as well (here’s an example of a five-minute practice). Shift Your Mindset You can shift your mindset about a setback or challenge and orient it toward self-compassion through writing. Students in a comparison study who actively exercised self-compassion through writing exercises reported a greater motivation to change, a greater desire to address weaknesses, and exhibited higher effort to improve overall. These results were significantly better compared to both a standard control group and a group that did a similar writing exercise focused on self-esteem (rather than self-compassion). Try out this writing exercise to similarly shift your mindset. Draft an encouraging letter to yourself from your inner compassionate voice, answering the following questions: What would your inner mentor say about the challenges you’re facing? What might they suggest and how would they encourage you? What would you tell a friend who is struggling with a similar situation? We recommend that you start writing and keep your pen (or typing fingers) moving for about four to five minutes. Once you’ve written out your letter, take a moment to read over it and notice if you feel a greater sense of openness toward your challenges. You might also revisit it a few days or weeks in the future, and can even set up an email with delayed send to bring your encouraging words back when you might need them in the future. As we face a world that’s more uncertain than ever, we need leaders who look for common humanity with their employees, customers, and stakeholders. We need leaders who connect and uplift others, and this starts by exercising kindness towards yourself.

"28",28,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-to-be-a-visionary-leader-and-still-have-a-personal-life","leadership.txt","The demands of an executive role can wreak havoc on the self and on personal relationships. Without thoughtful planning, leaders can experience both physical and mental-health issues as a result of their work, and their relationships with loved ones can deteriorate. While there’s no easy way to make everyone happy all the time, leaders who think carefully about their goals, discuss them openly with their loved ones, invest in their own resilience, and check in with themselves and others regularly can help prevent the collateral damage that’s all too common at the top of the org chart. “We nearly didn’t make it.” My client, the CEO of a large tech company, was reflecting on the past year. “It was all-consuming at times. But we found a way to refocus on what really mattered.” He was talking about his leadership role — and his marriage. Business leaders enjoy the “high” that comes from redefining the identity, essence, and capabilities of an organization and the exhilaration of achieving something few thought was possible. But given its demands, the leadership role can take over your life if you let it. By the time you realize that it’s resulted in collateral damage to you and those whom you care about, it’s often too late. Many of the 30 C-suite executives I’ve interviewed in the past 18 months expressed various forms of regret as they talked about their transformational efforts, their considerable achievements notwithstanding. They described themselves as “too intense,” “obsessive,” and “self-absorbed” and often wondered whether the job was really worth it. Isolation and loneliness were common feelings, too. Relationships with spouses, children, and friends can suffer from neglect. Self-care can also take a back seat, leading to addiction, anxiety, depression, narcissism, and cardiac problems. Research by Bupa Global shows that two-thirds of senior business leaders have suffered from mental health conditions. Early signs of trouble often emerge as cautious, uncharacteristic, or even unethical behavior. Recent research, for example, shows that CEOs going through divorce often pursue lower-risk strategies in order to maintain their compensation, much of which is in company stock, after they lose some of their cash and real estate in a settlement with their spouse. Being a successful leader requires energy, grit, and courage. You have to communicate new visions, break bad habits, pursue growth opportunities, and model new behaviors — all repeatedly and over a long period of time. Big leadership roles require hard choices and professional and personal trade-offs. Some things have to give, and there’s no magic formula to make everyone involved happy all the time. But what would it take for you to both transform your organization and leave yourself — and those around you — in reasonable shape? Any transformational leader will have a vision of what the organization will become. That vision has to be vivid, ambitious, and a genuine stretch in order to inspire commitment. A leader must play the role of translator, helping people understand what will be different and why it will be better. The same applies to the self. Think carefully about what you want to achieve by the end of your tenure — for yourself, your loved ones, and your organization. Visualize this in a way that feels tangible and real and that’s memorable, which is especially important in tough times. You could write a letter to your future self or record a video of your story. Just as you develop a road map for the organization, map out important, predictable life events — birthdays, your children going to college, and so on — that you won’t want to miss. This will help you identify the boundaries you’ll need to put in place. Schedule periodic check-ins to see whether those outcomes are still realistic and worth pursuing. There’s no point in being dogmatic or inflexible, especially if the professional or personal context has changed significantly. You can’t — and shouldn’t — do this job alone. Talk to your loved ones about what the role means to you and why you’re planning to take it on. Be candid about the demands, rhythms, and rewards on offer, and walk through likely scenarios that may affect your ability to meet personal obligations — for example, a crisis or a big M&A transaction. This will help you create more awareness and understanding with the people you care about. Ask for their advice on how best to manage the demands of the role, even if they don’t need to know its every detail. They will have seen you operate in previous roles and will know what has worked well and what hasn’t. Listen attentively, explore their perspectives, and seek to understand their needs and aspirations, too. This exercise will uncover common ground and tensions. Work with your loved ones to establish clear values, household and childcare arrangements, and professional boundaries. This “contracting” process should lead to an agreement — and a set of commitments — that you can use to hold one another to account. This isn’t a one-off exercise; it should be repeated regularly to assess how it’s working. Ideally, you’ll practice something like this with your teams on a regular basis as well. During my time at PwC, we asked questions like, “What do you need from me to be at your best?” and “What commitments outside of work should we be aware of so that we can plan and resource accordingly?” That helped create the psychological safety that allowed people to talk about other aspects of their lives that had a bearing on their performance at work. Your personal plan should include investments in resilience — your ability to bounce back after a setback or a shock. The obvious one relates to health and well-being. One CEO told me that she developed a regimen for herself that included a personalized diet and dedicated time for exercise, family, and sleeping. Sticking to that plan required setting the boundary of finishing her frequent evening meetings at a specified time. Others make choices about where they spend time. Jeremy Darroch, the CEO of the media and telecommunications company Sky, doesn’t want a wholly work-based life. He doesn’t go out much, because he wants to avoid being sucked into the London ”chatter,” which might cause him to overlook a wider perspective. Others carve out “thinking time” in their calendars and have blackouts at certain times of the day or week that may be interrupted only in emergencies. Resilience also comes from being surrounded by capable, motivated, and positive people (“positrons,” as one CEO I worked with called them). These are people who can be relied on to deliver what’s required, suggest ideas to overcome obstacles, and see opportunity when everyone else sees only problems. Identify the people on your team who fit this bill (or recruit them, if necessary), and give them prominent roles in the transformation. Most importantly, organize yourself so that you spend a good amount of your day with them. Also create networks of people who have your back, both at work and at home. These are people who care for you unconditionally, call you out if you’re acting like a jerk, and remind you of your commitments and values. Kathleen Saxton, executive vice president and managing director EMEA at MediaLink, created a “board she can’t afford” — a safe group for testing ideas and sharing challenges, made up of people who offer counsel when requested. Improving your behavior in the moment pays dividends, too. Pausing to breathe before reacting to difficult news, for example, can improve your quality of thinking. Learning what people think through effective listening and observation can give you more space to develop your own perspective. Careful disclosure of your hypotheses, opinions, and concerns with an invitation to contribute ideas also helps share the burden. One CFO used his gratitude journal to help him create a positive mindset before difficult meetings with investors and regulators. Another executive, a CMO, developed her own personal annual report — a mirror of the corporate kind — to help her capture what she was proud of and work out what she should change, both at work and at home. Building more resilience means you’re more likely to stay healthy and be grounded and happy, which will help you make sensible decisions and act in accordance with your values. As an executive, you’ll face an ever-increasing number of demands, and it’s easy to get stuck doing the same tasks with the same people. Soon you’ll be overwhelmed, exhausted, and bored. To prevent that burnout, it’s critical to focus on the most important activities and explore more-effective ways of doing them. That could include applying technology solutions or delegating. In any case, it requires creating a mindset of continual reinvention and committing to encourage others to do the same. Ask yourself the following questions: Adopting a reinvention mindset and approaching problems with curiosity anchors leaders in the pursuit of learning. This can only benefit your commitments outside of work, too, as you periodically check in with yourself and your loved ones to reevaluate goals, aspirations, and plans. There is a growing acceptance of the need for organizations to contribute more than shareholder value. Shouldn’t leaders and their loved ones get more than shareholder value, too?"
"29",29,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/stay-cool-under-pressure-without-appearing-cold","leadership.txt","If you’re a manager who handles stress with ease, while your boss and team become wound ever tighter, you may give the unfortunate impression that you don’t care about the work or your colleagues. Being cool under stress is an asset, but your colleagues may read your unruffled nature as “nonchalance.” This perception could hurt your career trajectory. This article discusses three ways to change that perception. The American Institute of Stress reports that 40% of workers believe their jobs are “very or extremely stressful.” During the pandemic, this perception has intensified; an American Psychological Association survey reports that the economy is a “significant” source of stress for seven in ten adults. Yet not everyone feels the effects of stress the same way. If you’re a manager who handles stress with ease, while your boss and team become ever more tightly wound, you may give the impression that you don’t care about the work or your colleagues. Being cool under stress is an asset, but your colleagues may read your unruffled nature as “nonchalance” or indifference. This perception could hurt your career trajectory. Here are three ways to change it: Public speaking is a stressor for many — but not all — people. If you don’t sweat presentations, you may view a virtual town hall, for example, as an easy way to highlight your department’s story. But if you aren’t exhibiting outward signs of stress, your manager could assume you aren’t taking the presentation preparation seriously. If this describes you, over-communicate with your boss: tell him or her that you know it’s important, and that you’re on the case. Never assume your manager knows what you’re thinking. When others around you feel stress, address the situation head-on. For example: “I know budget planning time is crucial to the success of our department. Because our Executive Leadership Team session will be difficult, I am meeting daily with the planning group so that our numbers are correct and we are prepared for tough questions.” Many leaders have coping mechanisms that help them handle stress. These include overpreparing, changing their mindset, repeating positive affirmations, biting off small chunks of big tasks, and taking imperfect action. Whatever methods you employ, one aspect of your job as a manager is to help your team alleviate stress, so it’s important to share your process.  Remember that your teammates might mistake your level-headedness for aloofness. If you share your stress-alleviation techniques, your team and manager will see that you care for the wellbeing of your peers. For one leader I coached, meeting with the Chief Revenue Officer was a stress trigger. His solution was to overprepare; this helped meetings run smoothly. My client then coached his peers to duplicate his approach: to finish their work at least a week in advance, share the data with a peer to test for errors, and practice the conversation at least three times before the meeting. While that may seem like a lot of extra work, it improved their meetings. Some leaders mitigate stress by simply doing something. Acting on one small piece of the puzzle can produce feelings of accomplishment. One manager shared with me that he felt a new business unit was being set up for failure because not enough people were assigned to it. The manager understood that he had to push forward and succeed without additional resources. He coached the team in place to stay calm under pressure by taking steady action on whatever needed doing. While this approach didn’t turn the business unit around, the team was motivated to handle what they could until they gained more members. If you struggle to understand why everyone around you is stressed, you risk seeming indifferent. One leader I worked with couldn’t understand outward stress behaviors: he expected his team to have individual plans to manage their stress, as everyone transitioned to work at home. Another Senior Vice President shared this mindset, and his 360° review demonstrated that his team viewed him as “uncaring.” To soften this impression, I coached the leader to ask the question: “What can I do to help you?” This small change — and the answers it elicited from his team — helped the SVP understand how team members felt in stressful situations, why they felt that way, and what he could do to help. By being empathetic to others’ stress levels and teaching them your own coping mechanisms, you show that you care. This care will yield dividends both for you and the department.

To lead, you must be able to connect, motivate, and inspire a sense of ownership of shared objectives. Heightening your capacity to lead others requires being able to see how you think and act, and how your behavior affects others. Leading well requires a continuous journey of personal development. Yet people in leadership roles often eschew the long and challenging work of deepening self-insight in favor of chasing after management “tools”— preferably the “quick ’n’ easy” kind, such as personality type assessments that reduce employees to a few simplistic behavioral tendencies. Tools can be handy aids to good leadership. But none of them can take the place of fearless introspection, feedback seeking, and committed efforts to behavioral change for greater effectiveness and increased positive impact on others. When you’re an individual contributor, your ability to use your technical expertise to deliver results is paramount. Once you’ve advanced into a leadership role, however, the toolkit that you relied on to deliver individual results rarely equips you to succeed through others. Beware of falling into the logical trap of “if I can do this work well, I should be able to lead a team of people who do this work.” This would be true if leading others were akin to operating a more powerful version of the same machinery you operated previously. But it’s not; machinery doesn’t perform better or worse based on what it thinks about you and how you make it feel, while humans do. Occupying a leadership position is not the same thing as leading. To lead, you must be able to connect, motivate, and inspire a sense of ownership of shared objectives. Heightening your capacity to lead others requires being able to see how you think and act, and how your behavior affects others. Leading well requires a continuous journey of personal development. Yet people in leadership roles often eschew the long and challenging work of deepening self-insight in favor of chasing after management “tools”— preferably the “quick ’n’ easy” kind, such as personality type assessments that reduce employees to a few simplistic behavioral tendencies, or, for example, implicit bias workshops that are used as a band-aid solution for systemic discrimination, or stack ranking systems that purport to identify the best talent by requiring managers to compare employees to each other. Instead of being a short cut to effective leadership, this mechanistic approach is more often a dead end that misdirects leaders’ attention away from the linkage between their own behavior and employee outcomes. As an example, I worked with an organization that had disengaged employees and frustrated managers who wanted to instill greater commitment and accountability in their teams. A few years earlier, the firm had overhauled its performance management system. The centerpiece of the new solution was a system that prompted managers to enter performance goals and ratings for their direct reports, schedule performance review meetings, and complete the annual performance appraisal process within a specified time period. When managers completed performance appraisals on time and the ratings they gave fit the target distribution,  its sponsors claimed that the system had increased precision and accountability in performance management. What the system’s dashboard didn’t show — and its sponsors failed to appreciate — was that implementation had accompanied a downward spiral of employee morale and engagement. Employees reported that their managers didn’t appreciate their value and were uninterested in their development. Many were on the lookout for new opportunities elsewhere. For their part, managers felt that the organization made performance management cumbersome. They were also blind to their own contributions to a workplace climate that weakened commitment and accountability. Tools can be handy aids to good leadership. But none of them can take the place of fearless introspection, feedback seeking, and committed efforts to behavioral change for greater effectiveness and increased positive impact on others. In my work with the organization above, I helped leaders learn that their greatest leverage to improve the commitment and accountability of their employees lay not in tracking their goal completion, but in creating and sustaining a motivating interpersonal environment. While we did use tools such as frameworks and checklists, their function was to help leaders note the quality of their own and their employees’ experience of work and shift it in a more collaborative direction; they weren’t to be used as replacements for this essential work. Leaders learned to recognize how their assumptions shaped their behavior and learned to consciously adopt mindsets and behaviors that produced better leadership outcomes. Instead of hoping in vain for a magic tool to come along to help you manage your team, think of creating practices to increase your leadership proficiency. This involves taking an idea or research finding and translating it into behaviors that you can repeat systematically to create the desired result. You can use the following steps to design a learning practice for any developmental challenge you’d like to take on: Start with a problem you’d like to solve or a future result you’d like to achieve. What outcome would make a meaningful difference for you? As an example, let’s say that you’d like to see your team members become more proactive in identifying and solving problems. Articulate why it’s important to you now. Getting clear on your purpose and motivation increases the creativity and persistence you apply to designing and sustaining your practice. Perhaps you care deeply about being a wise steward of your organization’s human resources and about bringing out the best in your team members. You believe that more fully harnessing each person’s creativity will benefit the company and your team members. You’ve been feeling overloaded and believe that recapturing some of the time you currently spend overseeing team members’ work will help you be more effective. You also want to reduce the frustration you feel at having to generate all the ideas and plans for your team. Seek quality information to base your approach on. You don’t know the best ways to encourage proactive problem solving, so you check in with your coach or mentor or search for some relevant books and articles. If I were coaching you, I might point you toward practical, research-based articles on encouraging proactivity, developing learning agility, and facilitating learning on your team. Identify measures of success. What would increased proactivity in identifying and solving problems look like in practice? How will you know if you’re making progress? Based on your thinking about what you want to achieve and the reading you’ve done, you decide that you’ll keep track of how frequently team members make suggestions, offer additional ideas to help refine a course of action, and take ownership over implementing a decision. You’ll also monitor your own internal state and how you interact with team members, looking for reduced frustration in yourself and greater enthusiasm and ownership from team members. Finally, you’ll seek feedback from your direct reports. Ground yourself with an intention. You commit to learning to support proactive behaviors. You place a sticky note with this intention on your computer where you’ll see it first thing each morning. Whenever you meet with team members, you call this intention to mind so that it functions like a beacon to guide you, keep you on course, and prevent you from sliding back into your habit of jumping in with the answer if no one else comes forward right away. Choose behaviors to implement. From the reading you’ve done and discussions with your coach, you design the following practices: Seek feedback. Tell your team members that you’re working to support their proactive problem solving and that you need their feedback to help you get better at this. Ask them to let you know whenever you do something that either hurts or helps. Let’s say that a few people note that you tend to shoot down others’ suggestions and micromanage when you’re under stress. Based on this feedback, commit to refrain from criticizing ideas and instead ask team members to assess the pros and cons of each idea. Review and celebrate progress. Within a few weeks, you’ll be able to tell that you’ve made progress if team members are engaging more actively in problem solving on a regular basis. You’ll have a newfound appreciation for the creativity of some employees. If you’ve continued to seek feedback and the team has responded, you should now be able to spend more time clarifying desired outcomes with team members and less time overseeing their work, resulting in a net gain of time and energy. You’ll feel more enthusiastic about leading your team and realize that you have more capacity to develop yourself as a leader than you previously appreciated. It’s one thing to want to hold a leadership role; it’s another to want to do the deep work that learning to lead entails. Resisting the developmental journey of leadership is like flying to an exciting locale, but then spending your whole time there in the airport bar. On the other hand, interest in and commitment to continuous learning and development as a leader will keep you fresh and vital. There’s a valley to cross before you reach the peak. And there’s another valley between that peak and the next one. The developmental journey is fascinating and fulfilling if you embrace it. You don’t have to wait to be trained; you can design leadership development practices any time you want. Monique Valcour is an executive coach, keynote speaker, and management professor.

They say something like “You need certain important intangibles” or “You don’t have enough gravitas,” but they fail to provide advice or guidance. What they’re talking about is leadership style. In every interaction, we send signals to others that fall into two categories: power and attractiveness. Powerful markers are associated with confidence, competence, charisma, and influence but also arrogance, abrasiveness, and intimidation. Attractiveness markers are related to agreeableness, approachability, and likability but also diffidence, lack of confidence, and submissiveness. The more consistent our signals, the more distinctive our style. This practical guide offers concrete advice for developing a dynamic and effective leadership style that draws from both types of markers for maximum impact. Bosses often sense that something is lacking in an employee’s tool kit but can’t put a finger on what it is. They say something like “You’re missing important intangibles” or “You need more gravitas” but fail to provide advice or guidance. What they’re talking about is leadership style. In every interaction, we send signals to others about our power and status. The more consistent we are in our signals, the more distinctive our style becomes. This practical guide offers concrete advice for developing a dynamic and effective leadership style, including tips such as what volume and pace to use in your speech, whether to take notes in a meeting, and how and when to interrupt others. Few things are more frustrating for talented  professionals than hitting a ceiling in their careers because they lack the appropriate leadership style. A boss senses that something is missing in a person’s tool kit but can’t put a finger on exactly what it is or how the person can improve. The boss says something like “You’re lacking important intangibles” or “You need more gravitas” but fails to provide specific advice or tools for improving. It is equally frustrating to watch people with mediocre technical skills move up the ladder quickly because they have an exceptional leadership style. Bosses defend such promotions by emphasizing the employees’ soft skills, calling them “poised,” “confident,” and “dynamic.” The truth is that these things matter: A great leadership style can make people appear more competent than they truly are, and a poor style can drag down a superior skill set. So how can aspiring executives improve their leadership style? First, it’s important to understand that style is distinct from personality. The latter is immutable; it’s who you are on the inside. Style is best described by what you do, how often, and when. More than 30 years ago, the sociolinguist Howard Giles and colleagues first identified a set of behaviors, or social markers, that we all use to express ourselves and by which we evaluate others. These markers are a language we learn in childhood, as we begin to see that people behave differently depending on whether they hold status or not. Older siblings may bark at you for the remote control, for example, but behave obsequiously to parents when they want to borrow the car. Social markers can be expressed through language, nonverbal communication (such as body language), or context setting (sitting at the head of the table, for instance). Your choice of markers determines how others view you. Through our own academic research and a combined 30 years of proprietary research, including engagements with more than 12,000 leaders in our executive coaching practice, we have identified the markers most commonly used in the workplace to express status. 
  Together, they make up leadership style. The signals used to communicate status fall into two categories. The signals we send to others about our status—or lack thereof—fall into two categories: power and attractiveness. Neither set of markers is inherently good or bad. Powerful markers are associated with expressions of confidence, competence, charisma, and influence but also arrogance, abrasiveness, and intimidation. Examples include interrupting others and grabbing a pen off someone’s desk without permission. Attractiveness markers are related to expressions of agreeableness, approachability, likability but also diffidence, lack of confidence, and submissiveness. Examples include holding the door for someone and favoring questions over statements. People with powerful styles often view more-attractive colleagues as weak. People with attractive styles tend to view powerful colleagues as rude. The more consistently we express ourselves using the same markers, the more distinctive our style becomes. When a colleague gives the impression of being arrogant, for example, it’s most likely because he uses a small set of powerful behaviors consistently. Or when a manager offers an appraisal such as “Kristin simply does not have a seat at the table with her peers,” that usually means she uses too many attractiveness markers—perhaps she never states her views publicly, or she speaks so softly that people ask her to repeat what she said. Change the frequency or mix of these markers, and others’ impressions also change. We all have a particular set of markers that we default to in neutral situations or when the social context is unclear. This can be called our natural style. We behave more powerfully relative to our natural style when we feel we have the status (for example, we are the more senior, educated, experienced, technical, or connected person in a workplace interaction). We behave more attractively relative to our natural style when we are the more junior or less-experienced person. Most people’s natural style falls into one of five categories along a spectrum: powerful, lean powerful, blended, lean attractive, and attractive. Few people favor the extremes, instead leaning to one side or the other. A truly blended style is rare and involves an equal use of both power and attractiveness markers. A blended style can be best summed up as having “presence.” Leaders who are praised for their polish and gravitas have a deft ability to adopt the right markers to suit the situation. Julia Marie Werner Our research on blended leadership styles is similar in concept to that of social psychologist Amy Cuddy on warmth and competence. But whereas Cuddy and colleagues generally advise leaders to first project warmth to gain trust and then display their competence to gain credibility, we believe that power and attractiveness should be dynamic. Some situations will call for a leader to exhibit powerful markers from the outset; some will call for a more attractive approach throughout. Leaders often need to tweak their style multiple times in a day—sometimes in the course of a single situation. In one meeting, a leader may need to gain the respect of her peers by projecting subject matter expertise and strong advocacy. But in the next meeting, she may want to be seen as a collaborative partner and will choose to lean attractive by listening attentively and asking more questions. Cuddy and others instruct leaders to focus on how they feel (feeling strong will help you project strength, and feeling warm will help you project warmth). Our work with executives focuses on their actions and behaviors. Power and attractiveness are determined by what you display toward others, regardless of how you feel on the inside. For instance, you may be very nervous going into a large presentation, but by consciously favoring power markers, you can project confidence, and your audience will be none the wiser. In our work, we have observed thousands of leaders who have successfully experimented with markers, created a blended style, and reaped professional rewards as a result. Some developed a blended style early in their work lives; those leaders are the “naturals.” But others struggled to move up the ladder and learned to modify their behavior—often through painful trial and error. The learning curve can be steep, but we believe that any leader can achieve a blended style by following several steps. To balance powerful and attractive markers, you must first diagnose where you fall on the leadership style spectrum. Often, executives can read between the lines when they receive feedback from managers, peers, romantic partners, or even their own children. Comments such as “You’re too nice” and “You need to speak up” might suggest a tendency toward attractive markers. Comments such as “You’re intimidating” or “You don’t listen to me” might suggest an overly powerful style. There’s no shortage of people around you who can provide helpful insight; just ask them. If you’re unsure where you fall on the spectrum, keep a list of markers in front of you during various interactions and check off the ones you use. Which column ends up with more check marks? As more meetings move online because of the pandemic, it is an ideal time to try recording video meetings and assessing your behavior after the fact. Once you have a sense of where you fall on the spectrum, begin to experiment with markers to try to move toward a more-blended style. As a start, pick one verbal and one nonverbal marker and find a way to use both during an interaction. This may feel foreign at first; rehearsing with a friend, mentor, or coach can help make the new behaviors more familiar. The interpretation of style markers can vary significantly by culture, context, and industry. A behavior that is considered a power marker in one situation may be considered attractive in another. For example: In the United States, making eye contact with managers senior to you is often seen as a marker of confidence. The same behavior in Brazil is seen as appropriately deferential (and not making eye contact is considered rude). In Japan, it is viewed as insubordinate and disrespectful. In all three contexts eye contact is a key marker of status, yet it is interpreted differently in each. How one dresses is a universal marker of status and influence. In some African countries wearing tribal dress is a power marker for both men and women. In the United States, people’s attire is judged according to the norms of the business. A tech founder entering a meeting with investment bankers (most likely all wearing suits) in a T-shirt and jeans is displaying a power marker. An applicant for a low-level service position who arrives in a suit is displaying an attractive marker by showing an eagerness to impress. In the United States, note-taking in meetings with senior leaders or clients can be perceived as too deferential. In contrast, in South Korea, not taking notes when speaking with senior leaders may be construed as disrespectful, suggesting that you do not think what they’re saying is important or worth remembering. In Western cultures, sitting at the head of the table for a conference or a meal is considered a power move. The same holds true in Japan, but with additional intricacies. As a rule, the area of a room closest to the entrance is where the shimoza, or “bottom seat,” is located. The area closest to the tokonoma (a formal alcove for calligraphy or flowers) is the kamiza, or “highest seat.” In the absence of a formal tokonoma, a window—or simply the seat farthest from the entrance—signifies the highest position. The guest of honor sits in the kamiza, and the host and other guests seat themselves on downward, toward the shimoza. As you become more adept, add to your repertoire. We suggest a “pick and mix” approach—taking a selection of powerful and attractive markers and experimenting with them. Consider in advance how you want to be seen in a given situation and then choose markers that reinforce that style. If you want to be seen as a trusted adviser, lean attractive. If you want to be seen as a respected adversary, use mostly powerful markers. But don’t go overboard: One or two markers in each category should be sufficient to establish or alter others’ impression of you. As you experiment, some markers will be easy to adopt, but others may feel contrived—and that’s OK. Emulating the style of others or flexing your own in new ways to create a broader range for yourself does not make you inauthentic; it means you’re growing as a leader. Successful leaders are true to who they are while continually making small adjustments in how they carry themselves, how they communicate, and how they interact depending on the circumstances. Consider football coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to five world championships and remains an enduring symbol of leadership. After struggling early in his career as he transitioned from college football to the NFL, he quickly learned that he had to adjust his leadership style. What worked with his college players was not effective with the pros. In his first job as the offensive coach for the New York Giants, his style, which fell on the extreme end of powerful, antagonized and alienated his more-seasoned players. Julia Marie Werner According to When Pride Still Mattered, by David Maraniss, Lombardi was seen as loud and arrogant. The players referred to him as “Little General” and “Little Mussolini.” But then something unexpected happened: Lombardi adjusted. “He began roaming the hall of the Willamette dorm at night, visiting with the…players,” Maraniss writes. “He acknowledged that he had much to learn and sought their advice, help, and loyalty….He tried to become one of the guys, not the authoritarian boss but the smarter older brother; they called him Vince or Vinnie, not Coach or Mr. Lombardi. He drank beers with them, laughed loudly at their jokes, told them how much he wanted them to succeed.” An executive we worked with—we’ll call him Martin—had a similar problem. He grew tired of the constant feedback that he was intimidating, domineering, and coercive. Our observations revealed that Martin, like many other people we’ve studied, exhibited a much more powerful style in professional settings than he did in other social contexts. To help him soften his style, we asked him to adopt four specific markers of attractiveness. First, we pointed out how often he interrupted and talked over others, especially in group situations, and asked him to reduce those interjections. That took some time, but eventually he learned to wait for others to finish before commenting. Second, we asked him to accompany his opinions with questions more often. That was also a difficult adjustment because he maintained a strong preference for declarative statements. Third, we asked him to incorporate “partnership language” by using fewer “I” references and more “we” and “our” references. That was easier for Martin; he deeply valued inclusive language and had not noticed his overuse of self-referential (“I,” “me”) and possessive (“my team”) expressions. Last, we asked him to demonstrate empathetic listening by slowing down and restating what he had heard from others. The unintended consequence was that he also made more eye contact when he listened—another attractive marker. Martin was highly committed to changing his style, and it worked. After six months, colleagues noticed a favorable difference. By moving from a powerful style to one that leaned powerful instead, Martin began to earn more-favorable evaluations. One question we often get from executives is how to know when to lean powerful and when to lean attractive. Gaining an ability to “read the room” is part of fine-tuning your leadership style. Although you may have an idea of how you want to be perceived when entering a situation, your plan may need to change once you’re actually there. Generally speaking, you should assess the markers you’re receiving from others before deciding on your own approach. More often than not, if you’re receiving power markers from someone, you will want to match them to garner respect. Similarly, if you’re reading attractive markers from others, you’ll want to lean attractive so as not to seem overbearing. Executives make a common mistake by using power markers with subordinates and attractive markers with higher-ups. The opposite approach is often more effective. Using power markers with juniors—such as ignoring them, abruptly changing topics, or talking too much in their presence—can make you less effective. In contrast, using too many attractive markers—phrasing statements as questions, speaking more slowly, and using nonfluencies (such as “um” and “you know”)—can lead executives to conclude that you’re not their peer. Overemphasizing attractive markers when communicating upward to show respect is particularly likely to backfire in U.S.-based companies. To solve this problem, lean powerful with more-senior people, and lean attractive when talking to more-junior people. Our research and coaching are complicated by the fact that leadership style cannot be fully divorced from unconscious biases and discrimination. Leadership is a normative construct; when asked to “draw a leader,” people (regardless of their gender) tend to draw a man. Research shows that women face a competency-likability trade-off: The more they demonstrate proficiency, the more likely their peers are to find their style off-putting. Minorities and LGBTQ executives who look or act in a manner that doesn’t conform to an organization’s dominant culture may also be penalized by colleagues who characterize them (perhaps unconsciously) as “not like us.” To determine where your natural style falls on the leadership spectrum, be open to the feedback you hear from managers, coworkers, friends, and family members, and identify common themes. Despite the fact that the hallmarks of leadership style are similar around the world, people of diverse groups are often judged differently even when they display identical style markers. When a woman disagrees with her colleagues, for example, she may be labeled “abrasive” or “aggressive,” while her male colleague is seen as “candid” or “direct.” We certainly don’t advise women and minorities not to get angry, disagree, or promote their accomplishments. Rather, we advise them to carefully select markers that will help them develop a blended style. The right assortment can allow you to show loyalty to the group you want to lead while still maintaining your uniqueness. Certain minority leaders will want to adopt more power markers; others will need more attractive markers. But again, don’t go overboard. Altering your style to conform in a way that hides your diverse traits, or overplaying your differences in a way that distracts from your leadership, can backfire. Women must walk a narrow tightrope: They must have the courage to interrupt, use fewer nonfluencies, and use more-intense words while blending in more relational and empathetic responses, statements as questions, and happy expressions. Male leaders who are perceived as outliers in a group also have a small margin for error. We wish this weren’t the case—but as long as unconscious bias and discrimination exist, minorities and women will need to put extra effort into developing a blended leadership style. The late U.S. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg used a blended style to her advantage. She was known for her ability to “disagree agreeably”—which helped her create unlikely friendships with more-conservative judges and foster loyal followership beyond the Court. No pushover, she picked her battles wisely and used attractive markers when necessary. As she wrote about her style, “reacting in anger or annoyance will not advance one’s ability to persuade.” In our research and consulting, we have seen that style is a significant differentiating factor in the reputation and career success of leaders. The good news is that style isn’t like personality—it can be intentionally altered. Dynamically integrating a broader range of powerful and attractive markers in everyday interactions can make a big difference in how we are perceived. The result is a true blended style that enables leaders to become powerful enough to be heard and attractive enough to be followed."

Its footprint was limited to Spain and a bit of Latin America. Looking for a CEO who was willing to challenge traditional industry models and build a better future, the company tapped Galán. His values gave him the grounding to design and lead Iberdrola’s green mission, and he describes the past two decades as some of the most rewarding of his career. He and his team focused an ambitious strategy on their core business of generating and distributing sustainable and renewable energy through plants, networks, and storage facilities, doubling down on a low-carbon future. Competitors thought they were crazy, and regulators raised a skeptical brow. Some senior executives retired or left. But since then Iberdrola has expanded into dozens of countries on four continents, grown to serve 100 million people with power, created one of the largest wind energy companies in the world, and closed all its oil and coal plants. Its net profit of 3.4 billion euros in 2019 represents a fivefold increase since 2001. I will never forget the day Íñigo de Oriol e Ybarra, the former chairman of Iberdrola, asked me to join the company as its new CEO. Iberdrola was the second-largest Spanish utility, after the state-owned Endesa. At the time, I was leading Airtel Movil, the Spanish mobile telecom company that in just five years had become the main competitor of Telefónica. Airtel had recently been acquired by Vodafone, and I had been asked to stay on under the new parent company. But I got a surprise call from Íñigo de Oriol, whom I knew by reputation. He asked me to meet him at a Madrid hotel bar frequented by the city’s top executives, bankers, and politicians. I walked in at 7 PM and found him at a central table. He got right down to business: “Ignacio, you need to join me. Come lead Iberdrola.” This was not said in a whisper; his voice was so loud everyone around us could hear. Iberdrola was the result of the merger of two Spanish utilities about 10 years before. Its assets, unlike those of many other energy companies at the time, were primarily sustainable: hydro and nuclear. But it also had some oil- and coal-fired power-generation plants, and its footprint was limited to Spain and a bit of Latin America. The company needed a CEO who was willing to challenge traditional industry models and build a better future. Needless to say, I decided to seize that opportunity. I was appointed CEO in 2001 and then chairman and CEO in 2006. The past two decades have been some of the most rewarding of my career. Thanks to the hard work of our entire team, we have expanded into dozens of countries on four continents, grown to serve 100 million people with power, created one of the largest wind energy companies in the world, and closed all our oil and coal plants. It wasn’t easy to commit to a growth strategy based on clean energy and reducing our operating emissions by 50% by 2030—before virtually anyone else in our industry was making any such promises. But it was the right decision. And in recent years we have been rewarded for our foresight. Since 2001 we have grown from about the 20th-largest worldwide electric utility to the third-largest, with our size and results multiplying by a factor of five. Most important, employees and subcontractors around the world consistently tell both us and rating organizations that Iberdrola is a great place to work. Our story should be instructive for any company interested in remaking its strategy in a way that benefits all stakeholders and promotes more-sustainable living. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic and social fallout, it will be critically important to build back better than before. And we can. It just takes values, vision, focus, and a lot more urgency than patience. Iberdrola the corporate brand was born in 1992, when Iberduero merged with Hidroeléctrica Española. In 2001, following my arrival, the company adopted a strategic plan that anticipated the world’s need for more clean energy and called for global expansion with the aim of doubling the size of the company’s revenue and EBITDA in just five years. We met that goal. Now Iberdrola was ready for the next step. My background had prepared me for the challenge. After graduating as an industrial engineer from ICAI, the engineering school of Universidad Pontificia Comillas, in Madrid, I went to work for a car-battery manufacturer and rose through the executive ranks. I then moved on to lead two aerospace-engine makers before my time building Airtel Movil into the second-largest telecom company in Spain and a Vodafone acquisition target. (It is now Vodafone España.) Both the board and I recognized that my previous experience was relevant. My engineering degree meant I could understand the details of the business. I’d led teams of engineers on complex projects and had built and sold highly technical products. I’d developed and executed on an ambitious B2C growth strategy. And my values gave me the grounding to design and lead Iberdrola’s green mission. I have a love for nature born during a village childhood surrounded by cows, horses, rabbits, trees, streams, and fields, and I abide by the Jesuit calling to serve not only oneself or—in the case of a corporate executive—one’s investors but all stakeholders and the broader society. Competitors thought I was crazy: Wind power was in its infancy, and solar was prohibitively expensive, so no one understood why I wanted to target renewable energy. Once in the CEO seat, my first job was to finally complete the merger that had been signed so many years before. I needed to make sure we were all rowing in the same direction. For months I talked to people around the company—in 10 to 15 meetings a day—and asked about their perceptions and priorities. I still have the sticky notes. I sought advice from professors, mentors, former colleagues, contacts within and outside the energy industry, even my son. What I discovered was that we had many good people who could unite around some key corporate values: hard work, honesty, loyalty, and team spirit. We also needed vision: a more ambitious strategy focused squarely on our core business of generating and distributing sustainable and renewable energy through plants, networks, and storage facilities. As world governments began taking climate change seriously and setting carbon emissions reduction targets, we aimed to leave fossil fuels and other interests (small stakes in Telefónica and Spanish media and property) and double down on that low-carbon future. And to have real impact, we had to transition from being a nearly 100% Spanish company to being a truly global one. My team and I worked on a plan and presented it to the board, explaining that it would require a €12 billion investment over five years, even as we accrued proceeds from divestitures. We would invest in acquisitions, new ventures, digitization, and the well-educated and -trained talent we would need to execute the plan. The board gave its approval within a day. Of course, we heard criticism from other corners. Competitors thought I was crazy: Wind power was in its infancy, and solar was prohibitively expensive, so no one understood why I wanted to target renewable energy. Regulators raised a skeptical brow. Some senior executives retired or left. Change is never easy. But after those departures and a few key hires, I knew I had a team committed to our plan, values, target, and goals. I won buy-in from employees through constant engagement. In those early years I started hosting hundreds of people in large town-hall-style gatherings. If we were scheduled for two hours, I would open with a 10-minute speech and spend the rest of the time answering questions. I also took online queries and feedback via our corporate intranet. Over and over, I explained what we aimed to do, where we wanted to go, and why it would be good for everyone. I still do this regularly. Believe it or not, the biggest hurdle in the whole transition process may have been persuading the board to change our blue logo to the green, blue, and orange leaves you see today. Everyone was used to the existing color and image, which had been around for decades. But I wanted a logo that symbolized our future. I had to plead my case over the course of three meetings. For the last one my team and I pulled out all the stops: We decorated the boardroom green, set a corridor of green flags along the road that fronts our Madrid headquarters, and lined up a fleet of green cars outside. The directors finally agreed. Then the work began, starting with divestitures and closures. We began phasing out oil- and coal-fired power plants and announced our final closure in 2017. We also sold off our nonenergy businesses. Then we turned our attention to renewable energy, smart grids, and storage, both at home and abroad. Most Spanish companies start with Latin America. Indeed, Iberdrola had already done that to a limited extent. Without setting aside that region, I was interested in countries with high credit ratings, more-predictable regulation, and stabler legal frameworks. They may not be as profitable as emerging countries, but they’re less risky. And our board and shareholders were expecting us to make safe and long-term—not speculative—investments. By 2007 we had integrated ScottishPower, which had a few fossil-fuel-dependent facilities but was moving toward a focus on wind; its subsidiary PPM Energy was at the time the second-largest wind farm operator in the United States. The £11.6 billion all-stock deal made us the third-largest utility in Europe. Many questioned whether a Spanish company could manage a traditional British utility. I remember that one competitor launched a campaign with a picture of a flamenco dancer, inviting our customers to switch to it. But when we presented our philosophy and targets to executives, shareholders, and local politicians, they bought in. And, as with subsequent foreign acquisitions, we kept the local team in place while transitioning the business in the same way our Spanish one had—moving out of unsustainable and high-carbon businesses and investing in sustainable and low-carbon ones. Our next move was in the United States: We acquired Energy East, a utility that then had more than 3 million electricity and gas customers spanning New England and New York. The investment community, particularly Wall Street, remained skeptical at first. It viewed us as Spaniards trying to push some crazy ideas through a heavily regulated industry in various parts of the world. And engineers aren’t always the greatest salespeople. But after further growth and mergers, our Avangrid business in the United States has $30 billion in assets and is listed on the NYSE with more than $15 billion in market capitalization at the time of this writing. I should point out that not everything we heard in the early days was negative; as we set out to implement our new strategy, we heard some positive voices, too. Even as far back as 2002, the analyst who covered us for UBS published a report called “Kiss the Frog,” referring to our new green image and suggesting that we now looked pretty attractive. The financial community started to believe, as we did, that our goals were achievable. We pressed on. In Brazil we bought and built assets and companies that now make up Neoenergia, which was successfully listed in 2019. We operate across 18 states in the country, covering all areas of the energy value chain—from wind and hydro and gas generation to transmission and distribution networks—and supplying energy to 35 million people. In Mexico we have grown over 20 years to become the country’s largest private generator of electricity. We have since invested in hydro and wind and solar in Portugal and in offshore wind in Germany and France, and we’ve established sustainable operations in Greece and Hungary. In 2020 we took our first steps in Australia, a country with huge renewable-energy potential. That has helped make us one of the top five electricity utilities in the world and a leader in wind power. And we continue to build out our operations in the United States and the United Kingdom, particularly with wind farms, while closing coal-fired facilities. Back home in Spain we’ve expanded hydroelectric capacity and deployed smart grids and meters around the country. We are now the country’s largest electricity company, supplying 20 million people—almost half the population. We plan to triple our renewables business here in the coming years. We are also investing in electric mobility, photovoltaics, battery storage systems, and blockchain technology to guarantee that our energy is 100% clean. At Iberdrola we are working to benefit society and our employees as well as shareholders. Since 2001 we have invested more than €100 billion in cleaner energy, smarter networks, and storage around the world. In 2019 our carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of electricity generated were just one-third the average among our competitors in Europe. For the second year in a row, Corporate Knights named us one of the world’s top 100 sustainable companies. The Ethisphere Institute has also rated us one of the world’s most ethical companies for seven consecutive years. In 2018 we received both the European Environmental Award from the king of Spain and an award from Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project, and we have been included on the FTSE4Good Index for a decade. We support 400,000 jobs around the world and focus on training and development, including company-sponsored university programs and classes on our own campuses. For just one example of how international and highly educated our teams are now: Our offshore wind design group consists of close to 1,000 people in four countries (a UK base plus the United States, Germany, and France) representing 18 nationalities and dozens of expertise areas, from marine biology to drilling, corrosion to weather. Internal surveys show that nearly 90% of our employees would recommend working for Iberdrola. The investment community remained skeptical at first. It viewed us as Spaniards trying to push some crazy ideas through a heavily regulated industry. Meanwhile, our net profit of €3.4 billion in 2019 represents a fivefold increase since 2001. In fact, since 2001 the total return for shareholders has been about 715%. Not only are we more profitable but we’re creating a stronger workforce; a cleaner, more efficient operation; and a safer world. Investors and analysts joke with me about some European competitors who are now trying to follow our strategy after years of milking fossil fuels. I say, “Welcome.” Climate change has become a climate emergency, and we need everyone on board to fight it. In a post-Covid world clean energy will offer real opportunities to drive economic growth, support industry, and create jobs. We believe that leaders in any organization, in any sector, can build companies that exist to benefit not just shareholders but also their workers and society. We must ensure that the business world puts sustainability and a future orientation at the forefront of strategy. It is both an obligation and an opportunity."
"33",33,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/reinventing-the-leader-selection-process","leadership.txt","The U.S. Army has long struggled with toxic and inept leaders, and no wonder: It has historically chosen battalion commanders, a linchpin position, on the basis of 90-second file reviews. Last year it undertook an ambitious revamping of that selection process, which now involves four full days of physical, cognitive, and psychological assessments and interviews. The author, a lieutenant colonel who served as an adviser to the task force that designed and implemented the new process, describes it in granular detail, including a variety of rigorous measures for reducing interviewer bias and ensuring diversity and inclusion. Although specifically aimed at improving the validity, reliability, and developmental impact of the army’s executive-leader selections, the redesigned process offers important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices. The U.S. Army needs its commanders to have competence and character. Yet in a survey of 22,000 soldiers, fully 20% reported serving under a toxic leader. Until last year the service had chosen battalion-level commanders—a linchpin position—by having senior officers independently score each candidate’s personnel file. A file review took about 90 seconds, and the key text examined in each annual performance report was shorter than a typical tweet. The army undertook an ambitious revamping of its selection process. Each candidate now undergoes four days’ worth of physical, cognitive, communication, and psychological assessments, concluding with an interview carefully designed to reduce bias. The new system holds important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices. Addressing a class of West Point cadets  in 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates asked bluntly, “How can the army break up the institutional concrete—its bureaucratic rigidity in its assignments and promotion processes—in order to retain, challenge, and inspire its best, brightest, and most-battle-tested young officers to lead the service in the future?” The question was, he said, “the greatest challenge facing your army—and frankly, my main worry.”   The secretary’s concern was not ill founded. In a 2009–2010 survey of 22,000 soldiers, 20% said they were serving under a toxic leader. Another survey showed that fewer than 50% of army majors believe the service promotes its best members. (The picture in the corporate world is similarly bleak. In one study, researchers estimated that half of senior executives were failing in their leadership duties. Another found that 16% of managers were toxic and 20% were incompetent.) In response to such feedback, the army designed an entirely new process for selecting battalion commanders—its first executive-level position, typically attained 17 to 20 years after an officer has joined the service. It chooses approximately 450 a year, each of whom is responsible for the training and development of 500 or so soldiers. Battalion commanders thus have an outsize influence on combat readiness and junior-leader talent retention; they are also the primary source of generals. That’s why Army Chief of Staff James McConville put the overhaul of their selection process at the core of his talent reform efforts. Over the coming year the first class of officers appointed under the new system will assume their commands. The selection process, which capitalizes on recent and emerging talent-management ideas from both the public and the private sector, includes physical fitness, cognitive, communication, and psychological tests; peer and subordinate feedback; and interviews rigorously designed to reduce bias. While specifically aimed at improving the validity, reliability, and developmental impact of the army’s executive leader choices, it offers important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices. It’s little wonder that the army suffered a crisis of competence in its leadership ranks. Ever since centralizing its officer selection process, in the 1980s, it had chosen battalion commanders by having multiple senior officers simply score each eligible lieutenant colonel’s file, which contained subjective performance evaluations, an assignment history, and an official photo. On average, some 1,900 officers would be eligible for consideration each year. Each file review took about 90 seconds; the key text examined in each performance evaluation was shorter than a typical tweet. Changing course in any large bureaucracy is never easy, of course, and the army faced all the usual obstacles and then some. The dominant laws governing its personnel practices had been written in 1947 and 1980. They directed that several thousand second lieutenants a year be commissioned, brought up to a minimum level of competence, and assigned and developed on the basis of seniority, specialty, and performance. People were managed largely as if they were interchangeable parts—and the system was more or less frozen in place because of its codification in law. But in 2018 Congress passed the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act, which granted the army the flexible personnel authority it had lacked. McConville—then the vice chief of staff—began making plans to improve the quality of the officer corps. The new process included cognitive, communication, and psychological assessments. McConville arguably has more HR experience than any previous army chief of staff. Having spent three years as deputy chief of staff for personnel—the service’s lead human resources officer—he has insight into the diverse talent needed in the thousands of army jobs. As a former commander of the 101st Airborne Division, he has learned that every soldier possesses unique skills and that the army’s diversity is increasing. And as the parent of three young army officers, he knows firsthand that generational norms are changing and that Millennials and Gen Zers want more control over their careers. Consider one of the problems he recognized. Let’s say the army needed to appoint an officer to advise an allied army overseas. Under its legacy system, it would identify candidates with the appropriate seniority (company commander) and specialty (logistics), perhaps reviewing their performance evaluations to make sure they ranked in the top 20% of their peers, and then choose from that pool. But whereas succeeding as a company commander mainly involves directly leading people who are similar to oneself, succeeding as an adviser abroad involves indirectly influencing people who may be quite dissimilar—and doing so in an unfamiliar environment. Simply giving the job to the best company commander would be unlikely to yield the best match. Better results could be obtained by identifying individuals with superior cognitive flexibility, cross-cultural fluency, and interpersonal skills. Moreover, if the army knew which officers enjoyed international travel and meeting people from different cultures, it could choose someone whose talents and preferences were suited to the position, most likely ending up with a high performer who would enjoy and remain in the job. Recognizing the need for adaptation that scenarios like this presented, McConville set out to transform how the army acquires, develops, employs, and retains its people, beginning with the linchpin role of battalion commander. First, the army redefined talent as the intersection of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and preferences, or KSB-Ps. Next, McConville energized and resourced the Army Talent Management Task Force—a small group of officers charged with prototyping innovative talent-management ideas—directing that inclusiveness should lie at the initiative’s core. (Disclosure: I serve as an external adviser to the task force, and I moderated one of the interview panels in the new selection process.) The task force researched army leadership doctrine and identified best practices from government, corporate, academic, and nonprofit organizations and allied militaries. It then designed the Battalion Commander Assessment Program, or BCAP: a four-day evaluation of more than 20 KSB-Ps, including communication skill, creativity, ethical leadership, and the ability to develop others. During the first three days candidates would undergo a physical fitness test, writing skill and argumentative essay examinations, cognitive and strategic talent assessments, psychometric tests, and a psychological interview. They would demonstrate their leadership and problem-solving abilities in a team-based outdoor obstacle course, and extensive peer and subordinate evaluations would be reviewed. The process would culminate on the fourth day with 30-minute interviews in which panels would evaluate candidates’ oral communication skills and decide who was ready for command. Those deemed so would be ranked according to a cumulative score informed by their BCAP assessments along with the rating assigned after a legacy-style review of their performance file (which the army still considers a valuable part of the selection process). The top 450 or so would be designated for command. Following two successful prototypes in the summer of 2019, McConville directed a full rollout of the program. During January and February 2020, 750 lieutenant colonels—eligible officers who opted to participate after being recommended on the basis of an old-style file review—gathered for the new assessment process at Fort Knox. The human brain is lazy; we are constantly looking for shortcuts when processing information. Interviewers are no exception. Research has shown that unstructured interviews are often the least-informative part of an assessment. Even experienced interviewers may spend the first 30 seconds of a meeting jumping to a conclusion about the candidate and the rest of the time subconsciously seeking information to confirm that conclusion. To guard against such shortcuts, the task force designed a full day of familiarization, calibration, and training for the BCAP panelists. Handpicked colonels were trained to serve as moderators to maintain a fair and consistent process. The work was guided by the following principles: The selection process spanned four weeks, with six panels operating simultaneously each week. Each panel had five voting and three nonvoting members and was assembled for diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity, specialty, and previous assignments. According to army tradition, voting privileges are limited to officers one level or more above the position under consideration; the voting members of each BCAP panel included three one- or two-star generals and two senior colonels, all of whom had been successful battalion- and brigade-level commanders. The nonvoting members, included to provide additional perspectives, were a command sergeant major with extensive experience advising battalion commanders, a senior operational psychologist, and the moderator. Panel members were taught strategies for preventing the attributional errors that occur most often during job interviews, including primacy (a tendency to focus on first impressions), contrast (rating candidates against one another instead of against a common standard), halo/horn (allowing a single positive or negative trait to overshadow all else), stereotyping, and similar-to-me biases. The training also emphasized the tendency among leaders to exhibit blind-spot bias: recognizing that others may be biased but falsely believing that you are not. Each morning the panelists received a brief antibias refresher before beginning their work. At the outset, panelists were given the names of the candidates and asked if they had any knowledge of them. This allowed organizers to create panels whose members had no preconceived notions about the people they were evaluating. Panelists were told to recuse themselves if they realized during an interview that they knew the candidate, which happened five times. Interviews can unfairly advantage candidates who have extensive interview experience. During the BCAP prototypes, the task force noted that whereas some lieutenant colonels were excellent interviewees, most were not. So candidates were instructed in the STAR method, which teaches people to answer questions by describing the situation, the task, the action taken, and the result. Although they were not required to use it, a majority did. To ensure a single grading standard, panel members were given a rubric for each quality to be assessed that described what was needed to attain each score. Before the panels began their assessments, they met together in practice sessions. First, each panelist independently assessed three mock candidates, and the entire group discussed the results. Members then regrouped in their panels to assess three new mock candidates and go over those results. Each group of mock candidates included one who was strong in the KSB-Ps, one who was moderately strong, and one who was weak. Borrowing a best practice devised by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1952, BCAP conducted double-blind interviews, with a black curtain separating the candidates from the panel at all times. This allowed panelists to focus on the content of answers and the KSB-Ps they were assessing rather than form judgments on the basis of ethnicity, attractiveness, or physical symbols such as wings on their uniforms. It minimized attribution biases that might be sparked by candidates’ physical presence. And it meant that deep issues could be discussed without fear of repercussions should candidates and panel members work together in the future. The task force also directed candidates not to disclose, and panel members not to ask about, specific jobs they had held or locations where they had worked. Klawe Rzeczy Although double-blind panels reduce bias (a test showed that the sergeants major incorrectly identified 50% of BCAP’s minority candidates as white), they don’t eliminate it. It’s usually easy to determine gender, and panelists may consciously or subconsciously try to link pitch, accent, speaking style, or content with a certain demographic. Candidates who learned English as a second language or hailed from the deep South, for example, might have readily discernible accents. So the bias-prevention work stressed the need not to penalize or reward speaking styles or accents. Applying a best practice long used by special operations units, BCAP brought operational psychologists into the process. Each of six senior psychologists supervised several junior colleagues conducting one-on-one interviews with candidates before their day-four interviews with panels. The senior psychologists collected summaries from the junior ones on the candidates seen that day and presented the results to the relevant panels in a standardized format. Because they did not interact with candidates themselves, they could be much more objective in conveying information about them. They also synthesized each candidate’s BCAP assessments into a summary of strengths and weaknesses and suggested follow-up questions for the panel to pose. The task force developed a bank of behavior-based questions for each KSB-P being assessed, rotating them in and out to reduce the chances of their being leaked. For instance, a candidate might be instructed to “describe a situation when you advised a subordinate about a significant challenge he or she was having.” In the first segment of each interview, the moderator asked questions from the bank in a set order, thus ensuring that all candidates had the same core experience. He or she then posed any questions the panelists had after reviewing the candidate’s performance in the first three days of events and hearing the senior psychologist’s summary. Panelists could themselves follow up with questions intended to further illuminate strengths or risks. Panel members were directed to elicit descriptions of specific situations and the actions taken in response and to avoid hypotheticals such as “would,” “could,” and “should.” For example, instead of asking, “How would you deal with an underperforming subordinate?” they might say, “Please tell us about a recent time when you developed a subordinate who was underperforming.” Candidates were required to wait 30 seconds before answering each question—an instruction driven by what psychologists know about certain personality traits. Because extroverts are typically comfortable thinking out loud, whereas introverts tend to process information silently, the waiting period was meant to ensure that the former did not have an unfair advantage. To further ensure fairness, panelists were instructed not to give feedback or discuss candidates’ answers and to refrain from any body language, such as a thumbs-up or an eye roll, that could signal approval or disapproval to fellow panelists. Borrowing a best practice from Google, which involves an applicant’s potential team members in the interview process, each panel included a command sergeant major—roughly equivalent to a general manager’s senior operations foreman. Those asked to participate had served as advisers to battalion- and brigade-level commanders and general officers and had keen insights about what the job of battalion commander requires. After each interview they shared their insights about the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses in each KSB-P. To minimize recency bias, they were directed not to indicate their overall assessment of the candidate. After the sergeant majors’ comments, panels held nonbinding votes on each KSB-P, with results visible to the moderator alone. If two panelists differed significantly on an assessment, the moderator asked them to give the reasons for their rating without sharing the actual scores. To avoid having the senior officer in the pair exert undue influence, the junior officer went first. Next, panels held their official vote. The moderator reminded members to base their ratings on the rubrics and not to identify their votes or discuss the candidates. With their votes panelists submitted comments about candidates’ developmental strengths and weaknesses in each KSB-P; those were relayed to the junior psychologists, who conducted a short “out briefing” with each candidate. To ensure consistency and fairness across panels, the general directing the BCAP initiative held daily meetings with the moderators, giving guidance and asking for input on issues, voting trends, and needs. Each day he observed at least one interview per panel via a live closed-circuit camera system. He would occasionally drop into panel rooms where members were wrestling with procedural issues and offer advice. The six moderators, the director, and a panel coordinator communicated regularly on a closed channel, sharing issues, concerns, and best practices in real time. Panelists could ask that the director observe their panel or visit it before or after an interview to clarify procedural concerns; such requests were accommodated rapidly, often within seconds. The organizational change expert John Kotter holds that a crucial step in leading change is building a guiding coalition. BCAP asked for input or participation from several key stakeholder groups: peers and subordinates of the candidates, including the sergeants major, and general officers. Prior to the assessments at Fort Knox, BCAP leaders emailed 10-minute surveys to candidates’ peer and subordinate officers. The pivotal question: Should the individual be given a battalion command? More than 65% of recipients responded (response rates for army surveys typically fall below 15%). In reviewing the survey results, panelists were reminded that leaders sometimes have to be stern and that they should consider negative feedback in context: If a clear majority of answers about a candidate were positive, negative responses to one or two items should be deemed outliers. A vast majority of the candidates were recommended for command by a vast majority of their peers and subordinates—suggesting that most lieutenant colonels are leading well, although some are not. Candidates completed the BCAP process regardless of the survey responses, since those were just one of several factors considered. The army’s current generals rose through the ranks via the old selection process, so careful thought had to be given to obtaining their buy-in. McConville asked the service’s 12 four-star generals to weight the assessments used to generate candidates’ final scores, thus signaling that senior leadership was behind the program and that everyone else was expected to be too. As mentioned, three one- or two-star generals sat on each panel. Because the selection process involved 24 panels in all—six panels in each of the four weeks—72 of the army’s one- and two-star generals, or more than 20%, took part. The BCAP assessments cost $2.5 million in travel fees, supplies, equipment, and so on, along with the opportunity cost of participants’ time. What did the army gain in return? BCAP’s most immediate impact will be on the soldiers led by the 436 newly selected battalion commanders. Remarkably, 150 of the new commanders, or 34%, would not have been chosen on the basis of legacy-style file reviews alone; although their file scores did not place them among the top candidates, their strengths in the BCAP assessments lifted them into that group. Moreover, 25 candidates whose file reviews would have earned them a posting under the old system were deemed “not ready for command” by their interview panels, many because they exhibited strong and consistent evidence of toxicity. Since future generals will be drawn mainly from today’s battalion commanders, these results mean that tens of thousands of soldiers (and their families) ultimately stand to benefit from commanders who are more fit, more capable, better communicators, and more thoughtful. (The army generally doesn’t publish demographic information about those selected for command.) The process also generated benefits for the candidates, regardless of whether they were tapped for command. The week at Fort Knox reconnected them with old acquaintances and introduced them to new ones. As we know from network theory and social psychology, strong professional networks increase one’s ability to get things done, while strong personal networks boost emotional stability and well-being. And all candidates (even those denied the promotion) were offered follow-on leadership development with a civilian executive coach, to work on findings from the process or on self-identified areas for improvement. A majority signed on, including 64% of male officers and 84% of female ones. Even seasoned interviewers may instantly jump to a conclusion about a candidate. In exit surveys 96% of the candidates, including 98% of women and 96% of minority officers, said that BCAP was a better way to select commanders. Two months later, after candidates had learned the results, 97% thought the new program should be continued. Some 11% called for major modifications—such as additional feedback, different evaluation criteria and events, and alternative assessment timelines—that will be analyzed and addressed for the future. Follow-up surveys and an after-action review revealed an unanticipated benefit: panelists’ own development. Although some generals initially questioned why they had to spend valuable time improving the process by which they had been chosen, in the end 95% of the panelists said they believed it was a better way to select battalion commanders. Some were grateful to be refreshed on the issues facing younger leaders. Many reflected on their own leadership behaviors, often commenting that the training made them aware of their biases and the need to lead more inclusively. The process also provided important information about the panelists. In a few years the army will know which new commanders are successful. Because it recorded all the votes on each candidate, it could identify especially effective evaluators and invite them to serve on other selection boards. And the initiative’s effects extend beyond those who went to Fort Knox. BCAP opened the army’s eyes to the possibility of creating a broader culture of evaluation and feedback. Some West Point instructors have adapted the writing rubrics for use in teaching cadets. At least one army unit is organizing a mock BCAP so that future candidates can increase their fitness and their writing and oral skills. The service is also considering using many of the assessments for the development of officers with four or five years of experience. The evaluations could be repeated several years later, allowing officers to see how they had grown (or not). At both points they could help officers and the army alike optimize assignments and development programs. As officers practice the skills spotlighted in the assessments, their abilities will increase, making for stronger leaders even among those who are never chosen for a battalion command. Finally, the army has used the BCAP template to design a similar program for selecting brigade-level commanders. And building on BCAP’s inclusion efforts, the Talent Management Task Force recently established a formal diversity and inclusion initiative that extends across its various programs. BCAP has given the army the most carefully vetted class of battalion leaders in its history. Candidates say they gained valuable perspectives and learned much about themselves. Soldiers asked to evaluate peer and superior officers were sent a clear message that their opinions matter and that leaders are expected to treat them with respect. Generals and colonels serving on the panels received a powerful refresher in what junior officers experience in their daily jobs and the skills they need to do them well. Many panelists also underwent the most thorough bias-reduction training they have ever received—which should drive more-inclusive treatment of the people they themselves lead.

"34",34,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/are-you-ready-to-be-coached","leadership.txt","Before you decide to work with an executive coach, assess your readiness to ensure you’ll actually benefit and grow from the experience. Take a look at yourself in the context of seven characteristics of successful coachees. Are you willing to hold yourself accountable for making progress? Are you open to new behaviors and ways of thinking? Are you ready to exercise the discipline necessary to stick to your coaching goals? Expect that the experience will cause you both excitement and some anxiety, and be ready to have an honest conversation with your coach about which characteristics are challenging for you. You may find that you’re not yet ready to get the most out of executive coaching, or you may gain insight into what it will take for you to meaningfully develop as a leader. Executive coaching can help you achieve higher performance and greater personal satisfaction at work. While you may be aware that you need to make changes — in behavior, mindset, or both — to advance your career, you won’t reap the benefits of coaching unless you’re prepared to fully engage in the process. This requires a substantial investment of time and effort, so before you move forward, the most important question you should ask yourself is, “Am I ready to be coached?” Having discussed challenging client experiences with many accomplished executive coaches, it’s clear that the corresponding question — “Is this leader coachable?” — figures prominently in their evaluation of whether and how to proceed. Drawing on these conversations, I identified seven core characteristics that differentiate leaders who evolve through coaching from those who don’t. Tolerance for discomfort. Successful coaching requires you to be proactive in embracing new ways of perceiving and acting. In doing so, you will likely experience fear or emotional blocks about new realizations and realities. You must be able to endure these periods of discomfort to realize the rewards of taking new and different approaches. Openness to experimentation. Trying something new means taking risks, and experiments with new behaviors may not work the first time. Waiting for the perfect timing or perfect performance will stand in the way of progress. If you think you already have the answers and are unwilling to explore new options, you are unlikely to be open or do the necessary reflection to change. You have to try out new ideas and actions, fail, learn, and try again. Ability to look beyond the rational. Behavior is not rational — it’s driven by emotions like fear, anger, and pride. Just because you “know” what to do doesn’t mean that you’ll act accordingly. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of your own behaviors and relationships if you explore their emotional dimensions. Willingness to take responsibility. It’s hard to change if you don’t believe you have the power to shape your future. Blaming the organization, the boss, too many responsibilities, and so on will block you from growth. Even if there is some truth in your reasoning, it’s impossible to move forward if you see yourself as a victim. You have to hold yourself accountable for making progress. Capacity for forgiveness. Even if you feel you’ve been mistreated, it’s essential to make peace with the past and channel your energy into progress. The need to “be right” or “show them” is rarely helpful for you or the people you work with. You must be willing to forgive and move on. Self-discipline. Somewhat counterintuitively, your development as a leader will likely require you to let go of ways of thinking and behaving that helped make you successful in the past and be prepared to live with the consequences. It may be hard for others to accept changes in your personal or work relationships. For example, you may have succeeded up to this point by saying yes to helping out colleagues and making yourself available. But disciplining yourself to say no and learning to focus on what’s important are essential parts of becoming a more effective leader. Even if those around you bristle at you no longer being available 24/7, you have to stay focused on your coaching goals. Ability to ask for support. Finally, you must be engaged with other potential supporters, not just your coach, throughout the coaching process. You are accountable for change, but you will develop faster if you make yourself vulnerable to others (judiciously), including your boss, peers, and even direct reports. Share goals, ask for advice, listen with curiosity, and most critically, accept and act on the constructive feedback you receive. It’s normal to feel both excitement and trepidation when deciding to work with an executive coach. Start by assessing the degree to which you have these seven characteristics, then discuss which are the most challenging for you. You may mutually decide that it’s not the right time to proceed. More likely, it will help you develop a stronger relationship and a deeper awareness of how to meaningfully develop as a leader through coaching.

"35",35,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/what-it-takes-to-lead-through-an-era-of-exponential-change","leadership.txt","No, it isn’t just you — the pace of change has picked up. More than that, whereas we used to experience disruptions followed by periods of stability, change now is increasingly perpetual, pervasive, and exponential. To keep pace, leaders need to take a different approach than the “leader as hero” model — the solo, individualistic leader who inspires certainty in a deterministic way forward. The authors suggest a new approach, which they call Sapient Leadership, inspired by conversations held at Stanford in the spring of 2020 with Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart; Toby Cosgrove, former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, heart surgeon, and White House advisor; Halla Tómasdóttir, CEO of The B Team, and runner-up in Iceland’s 2016 presidential elections; and Bret Taylor, President and COO of Salesforce. These leaders articulate a humble, nimble, and value-driven vision for leadership. Leader humility, authenticity, and openness instills trust and psychological safety. In turn, trust and psychological safety empower individuals and teams to perform at their highest capabilities. Additionally, continuously learning teams are essential for keeping pace with and effectively navigating 3-D change. Finally, shared purpose and common values enhance focus, cohesion, and resilience in the midst of 3-D change. To say that 2020 is a year of disruption and change is to understate the obvious. Our daily lives, from educating our kids, managing our health, and working from home, to simple social rituals like dinner with friends, underwent rapid multi-dimensional change. Nascent trends — virtualization of the workspace, online learning, virtual health, and e-commerce — accelerated exponentially. Changes anticipated to take years occurred in months and, in some cases, weeks and even days. Understandably, leaders have struggled mightily to address these overlapping changes simultaneously, dealing with economic, health, and logistical crises that have unfolded at top speed. Much as we might like to think of 2020 as an anomaly, it may not be. Conditions for accelerating change have been building for years. Advancements in information technology, automation, human interconnectivity, Artificial Intelligence, and the network effects among them, created a new reality where change is much more rapid, continual, and ubiquitous. Covid-19 and its derivatives laid bare a “new normal” of change, marked by three dimensions: This three-dimensional (3-D) change is defining our emerging future and, as a consequence, effective leadership will be defined by the ability to navigate this new reality. The problem is, our models for leadership weren’t built for this kind of 3-D change. Human minds evolved for thinking linearly and locally in the face of challenge, not exponentially and systemically. Noted futurist Ray Kurzweil asserted, “The future is widely misunderstood. Our forebears expected it to be pretty much like their present, which had been pretty much like their past.” But, projecting our pasts onto our futures exposes a fundamental error: Linear thinking can never catch-up and adapt to the perpetual, pervasive, and exponential change occurring around us — it’s simply too fast and too complex. We need a new form of leadership, better equipped to navigate this unprecedented kind of change. For this purpose, we gathered, under the Stanford University umbrella, world-class luminaries — leaders who generate impact and change at a global scale — for conversations on the future of leadership and change-making. What emerged was a new vision of leadership, which we call Sapient Leadership. A Sapient Leader is characterized by being wise, sagacious, and discerning in navigating change while also being humane in the face of change that can often feel alien. This kind of leadership emphasizes — counterintuitively — an anti-heroic leader. Sapient Leaders exhibit authenticity, humility, and vulnerability, inspiring the necessary trust and psychological safety that drives shared learning and intelligence, resulting in enhanced collective performance and leading to a better future for all. In a world that’s relatively stable and mostly predictable, where change is incremental, punctuated by relatively few bursts of large change — what’s often called “disruption” — a model of leadership that relies on linear, local thinking can be useful. Much of the leadership literature focuses on the qualities, skills, abilities of the leader as an individual, and the linear and local maps they use to navigate the world. However, 3-D change presents a “high seas” environment where the leader navigates multiple domains — the waves and ever-evolving weather — of change simultaneously. In this environment, linear and local thinking can never adapt fast enough, leaving us increasingly ill-equipped to manage our rapidly changing business and work environments, our physical and mental health and well-being, and the major trends that shape our societies and cultures. Change, by its nature, leaves people and organizations feeling confused, vulnerable, and fractured at a time when resilience, cohesion, and collaboration are necessary to perform at the highest levels. An emerging body of literature points to psychological safety, shared purpose, and distributed cognition as powerful drivers of leadership, team, and organizational performance, particularly in rapidly changing environments. The days of “leader as hero” — the solo, individualistic leader who inspires certainty in a deterministic way forward — are over. This evolution in how we think about change and leadership has only accelerated in the past year. Fortuitously, our spring course at Stanford University, LEAD 111 “Luminaries: Life Lessons from Leaders and Change-makers” became a study of how top tier leaders embodied this emerging approach to leadership. Finalized one week before the Covid-19 pandemic struck the west coast, our original plan was to create a new framework of leadership suitable for a time of disruption, accelerating change, and a highly polarized political and social environment, and we designed the course to engage leaders and change-makers in conversations across sectors, generations, and the political spectrum. We wanted to know how change-oriented leaders operate. As the pandemic unfolded, however, we expanded the course to create a new model of leadership. And recognizing that these questions were of immediate and broad interest, we invited more leaders within and beyond the Stanford community to weigh in on how they were navigating this 3-D change. We engaged leaders across sectors to analyze — in real time — how they adapted: captains of industry, such as Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart and chairman of the Business Roundtable; innovators in health care such as Toby Cosgrove, former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, heart surgeon, and White House advisor; global social change-makers such as Halla Tómasdóttir, CEO of The B Team, investor, co-founder of Reykjavik University, and runner-up in Iceland’s 2016 presidential elections; leading-edge technologists and innovators such as Bret Taylor, president and COO of Salesforce, co-creator of Google Maps and the “Like” button, and board member of Twitter. The essential question we had was this: If leadership is significantly defined by the ability to skillfully navigate 3-D change, what type of leadership is most effective for our emerging future, one defined by perpetual, pervasive, and exponential change? The answers that emerged formed the basis for Sapient Leadership. The four pillars of Sapient Leadership emerged out of the discussions with our luminaries as they were navigating 3-D change in real-time — each leader, in some capacity, articulated a version of these ideas. Leader humility, authenticity, and openness instills trust and psychological safety. In turn, trust and psychological safety empower individuals and teams to perform at their highest capabilities. Additionally, continuously learning teams are essential for keeping pace with and effectively navigating 3-D change. Finally, shared purpose and common values enhance focus, cohesion, and resilience in the midst of 3-D change. 1. Leader humility, authenticity, and openness instills trust and psychological safety. In times of uncertainty, leaders often posture themselves, maximizing perception of power and control. In contrast, Halla Tómasdóttir modeled authenticity and humility when she reflected on her challenges as a candidate during the Icelandic presidential election. She, along with many of our luminaries, openly questioned the traditional paradigm of a leader as an individualistic hero. Instead, she highlighted the need to build trust through openness, saying, “what this crisis has shown us is that the leadership style of ‘I know it all’ is not a good leadership style for this moment or any other challenge we are going to continue to face and need to deal with collectively, collaboratively, with compassion, and with care.” In a world of 3-D change, leaders need to continuously evolve themselves in order for their organization to evolve and grow. Rather than bending the organization to the will of the leader, a leader must be willing to instead exhibit humility and flexibility and change according to what the organization and circumstances require. Tómasdóttir exemplified this notion in her personal philosophy: “leadership is not given to the few — it’s inside of all of us, and life is all about unleashing that leadership.” This leadership style, which engenders trust and psychological safety within teams and organizations, animates much of her work with the B Team members that she’s leading — Sir Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, Ajay Banga, Mary Robinson, and Marc Benioff, among others. Our other luminaries echoed Tómasdóttir’s message about Sapient Leadership in the context of 3-D change. Doug McMillon said: “I don’t run Walmart, I help lead Walmart” asserting that leadership of this sort needs to go beyond words. Leaders, he said, “have to live it. It has to be authentic. It has to be habitual.” 2. Trust and psychological safety empower individuals and teams. 3-D change amplifies our innate and evolved human tendencies to skew towards threat perception, anxiety, and divisiveness when experiencing stress and encountering ambiguity. As such, psychological safety is even more important during these times change. Individuals and the teams they comprise thrive in environments where trust and psychological safety are present. In a recent extensive study at Google, code-named Project Aristotle — for the maxim frequently attributed to him, “The whole is greater than the sum of the parts” — researchers found that the most important factor associated with the highest performing teams was psychological safety. When team members feel safe to be vulnerable in front of one and to take risks, they perform at their best. A consistent theme running throughout conversations with all of our luminaries was the essential nature of empowering teams and individuals to perform at their highest capabilities, especially now. “Change is not a solo sport,” said Bret Taylor, president and COO of Salesforce. “All great change has been done by great teams, great communities, and great networks.” When recalling times of rapid change throughout his career — from the creation of Google Maps to inventing the “like” button to scaling rapidly worldwide during the early days of Facebook — Bret asserted the importance of leadership that motivates strong relationships, fluid communication, and a foundation of trust to driving exceptional team performance. 3. Continuously learning teams enable effective navigation of 3-D change. In a world where change is perpetual, pervasive, and exponential, Sapient Leaders, their teams, and their organizations must continually learn, update mental-maps, deploy new tools, and course-correct based on the best ideas and practices. “If you want to make a change in something you have to get into it deep,” said Toby Cosgrove, describing his openness to learning transformative ideas from anywhere he could. When he was the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic he regularly immersed himself in contexts where he could learn a better way. “If I heard somebody was doing something someplace in the world, I would pick up my pencil and paper and I would go and watch them do it,” he said. “I traveled someplace, learned something, and tried to bring it back and incorporate it.” What he was doing as a leader was both modeling leadership as a process of continual learning so others would replicate in their way, as well as disseminating what he learned throughout the organization in order to improve on existing processes and innovate new ones. In a world of 3-D change, no one person or organization can master all knowledge across all domains, no single person or organization can master enough skills in breadth, depth, or pace, to keep up. Instead, learning must be inspired by leadership, reinforced by culture, occur across a variety of domains, coordinated through the whole and shared openly and actionably to create the broader picture. The analogy here is to mosaic vision, or the compound eye, where thousands of specific receptor units, oriented in different directions, work in coordination to create a composite perspective with a very wide angle of view, continually updating in real time as the organism moves through time and space. Without data and input to synthesize into understanding and action, a team or organization will be perpetually impoverished. To keep pace with 3-D change, Sapient Leaders need to enhance the breadth, depth, and pace of learning in their organizations to meet the extent and velocity of change. 4. Shared purpose and values enhance focus, cohesion, and resilience during 3-D change. Professor Bill Damon, our esteemed colleague at Stanford University and one of the world’s leading purpose researchers, defines purpose as a stable intention to accomplish something that is both personally meaningful and serves the world larger than the self. Purpose, necessarily informed by our values and arising from a sense of personal meaning, unites our inner world with our actions in the world around us in a unique and powerful way in service of a vision larger than ourselves. In times of 3-D change, which by its nature amplifies uncertainty and ambiguity, shared purpose and values increase organizational focus, enhance team cohesion, and amplify personal and collective resilience. They can also powerfully mobilize large numbers of people to solve complex problems together. Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart and chairman of the Business Roundtable, recounted Walmart’s Five Guiding Principles, which provided the organization focus, resilience, and a basis for cohesive action during the early challenging stages of the pandemic. Doug recounted how these principles guided Walmart’s actions during the early turbulence of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We received a call from the White House with a request to open drive-through testing stations throughout the nation in Walmart parking lots,” he recalled. “Although we didn’t know exactly how to do it and didn’t have a way to charge for it, Walmart’s response was fully committed, rapid, at scale, and across distributed geographies. Walmart’s ethos during this time: ‘Don’t worry about the short-term financials. Go do what’s right and it will all eventually work out.’” The shared purpose and values articulated in Walmart’s Five Guiding Principles allowed collective action that was focused, cohesive, and resilient by many people across multiple geographies in the early times of 3-D change. Focus and cohesion allowed rapid learning of new skills, it allowed decisiveness during uncertainty, and it promoted working together towards a shared goal bigger than any individual or the company. Further, resilience allowed the courage to try something new and execute quickly, without giving up, in the face of ongoing change and challenge. Along with the myriad challenges it brought, the singular realization of 2020 is that 3-D change is the new normal. Navigating perpetual, pervasive, and exponential change is the quintessential test of effective leadership in this era. Leaders, teams, and organizations that don’t skillfully navigate change will fail. Mastering this new reality requires fundamental enhancements to our collective capabilities. Sapient Leadership enables the creation of perpetual, pervasive, and exponential capacity building necessary for handling 3-D change effectively. In addition, our recent conversations with Sapient Leaders have uncovered new ways in which exponential and transformative technologies can further enhance and amplify human capabilities. This topic is the basis for a future article we are preparing. The key of Sapient Leadership is that it fits into the long history of the evolution of our species. Sapient, in its definition, refers to the nature of humans — it is in our nature to adapt or risk perishing. The challenge of 3-D change is that it amplifies the pressures on leaders, teams, and organizations to evolve and adapt faster, or become irrelevant. Change that used to take place over years and decades is now taking place in weeks or days. We, as a species, have never confronted change of this magnitude or at this pace. Sapient Leadership is a framework that enables accelerated adaptation in a wise and humane way. It builds into its structure the imperative for leaders, teams, and organizations to continuously evolve in order to overcome the challenges of 3-D change. Sapient Leaders and their successful organizations change with change itself. Aneel Chima, PhD, is the Director of Health and Human Performance and of the Stanford Flourishing Project.

"36",36,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/how-the-best-leaders-answer-what-are-we-here-for","leadership.txt","Too often in a crisis, leaders resort to command-and-control leadership, focusing on rigid goals and rules to sustain the operations of their organizations. Instead, they should look to define the purpose behind their organizations. That shouldn’t be a top-down exercise: In examples from the NHS to private corporations and nonprofits, we can see that the best leaders develop the meaning of their organizations in concert with all those affected by it–employees, customers, patients, neighbors, and leaders. In a crisis, the possibility of failure feels close. This often drives leaders into command-and-control mode: more-rigid schedules, tighter budgets, exaggerated targets, hyperbolic promises. Military metaphors proliferate. But during a crisis of deep ambiguity and uncertainty, what’s more important than the rhetorical demonstration of certainty is the formulation of a strong, shared sense of meaning. Leaders can’t impose this from above. Their role is to become activists who convene people — employees, suppliers, customers, members of the communities that the company serves — to explore and define that meaning together. This article is one in a series related to the 12th Global Peter Drucker Forum, with the theme “Leadership Everywhere,” taking place as a virtual conference from October 28-30. See the program here. To succeed, in good times or bad, the leader of any organization must be able to answer the question “What are we here for?” In volatile times, focusing on that question is even more urgent, because the organization’s activity often needs to change. Past usefulness can become irrelevant overnight; just ask the owners of today’s travel businesses, movie theaters, and gyms. In this context, business as usual, even on steroids, is an inadequate response. Instead, leaders have to shift their goals from maintaining the status quo to constructing a newly imagined future. It’s hard for leaders to do both at once. “I’m trying not to drown in pragmatism,” one executive of a global advisory firm told me recently. Where are leaders to find their sense of purpose? Command-and-control cultures look to the CEO to concoct it, with the danger that it may lack both legitimacy and impact. “We may be in a pandemic, but the one thing we can do is make every customer feel financially secure,” a British banking leader told his team. While they recognized that this goal was well-intentioned, they also knew it was impossible to achieve. The alternative to imposing meaning is to let it emerge. The UK’s National Health Service tried both of these approaches —engineering meaning and letting it emerge — in different places during the peak of the Covid-19 crisis. In some regions, individual healthcare CEOs, believing that the emergency demanded their command-and-control leadership, took charge and leapt into their new style with avidity. They ordered people around, tried singlehandedly to design new systems, and put themselves at the center of decision-making. This slowed everything down. Widely dismissed as power grabbers, most of them ended up retreating, humbled by their inability to master the volume and complexity of demands. But in other regions, those very demands on the service collapsed a vast and intricate healthcare hierarchy into a single organism, which in turn generated levels of collaboration and cooperation across all levels and among other services (ambulance, fire and rescue, social care) with an ease and speed managers had previously only ever dreamt of. No leader imposed a sense of purpose, but everyone knew what it was: To do the right thing for patients, whatever that might require. When managers were no longer “doomed to hit targets but miss the point,” one doctor said, “it was incredible the ease with which we could do the right thing.” The challenge for NHS leaders going forward will be to fight for the freedom and resources needed to preserve that focus. For real integrity, an organization’s sense of purpose must derive from the ecosystem that the business inhabits — the full diversity of employees, customers, neighbors, partners, and leaders who are touched by its work. Otherwise it lacks both authority and impact. The most creative corporate leaders during the Covid crisis have understood this. Take the CEO of an intellectual-property agency who, once the logistics of working from home were resolved, shifted into activist mode. The world, she saw, had changed completely. In the community that the business served, everyone was suffering. For her business to stay relevant, it needed to be seen as a source of realistic hope. That was her instinct, but she didn’t trust it blindly. Instead, she convened groups of stakeholders — suppliers, employees, customers, partners — and asked them what they needed and expected of the firm now. Her first priority was to discover how the firm could better champion and empower its community, addressing and articulating its most fervent hopes and dreams. Ideas proliferated. New technology offered the opportunity to accelerate copyright enforcement. New strategic alliances promised to give the organization more clout. The business-development team overflowed with ideas for new products and services scarcely glimpsed before. A legitimacy of purpose developed, because everyone contributed to it. Instead of clinging to an old plan, customers and employees alike are galvanized now by the opportunity to grow in size and scope and influence. Convening and listening to stakeholders can break the boundaries of the status quo. In 1982, Larry Kramer founded Gay Men’s Health Crisis to educate the homosexual community about a new mysterious disease that was killing its members, but it quickly became bureaucratic and hierarchical, providing comfort and care but developing a preoccupation with its own survival. So Kramer, a notoriously impatient man, quit the organization and formed ACT UP, which was entirely focused on the future: Its purpose was to cure AIDS. And it was democratic (“to a fault,” Kramer said), convening an eclectic range of people whose passion and wildly differing areas of expertise allowed strategies to emerge organically. The group was raucous and frequently fractious, so the idea of its having a leader at all was contentious. But Kramer designed a role for himself that focused on preventing anyone from becoming complacent and by creating narratives about what both success and failure could look like. And when cures started to emerge, he didn’t take the credit. Peter Drucker once said, “A healthy business can’t exist in a sick society.” The health of any business depends fundamentally on the health of society — or that piece of it which the business serves. Today, as the Covid crisis continues, in parallel with an economic crisis, a crisis of inequality, and a climate crisis, the leader-as-activist role will only become more critical. The nature of their jobs will differ, but their purpose will be the same: To outrun irrelevance by convening and listening to both central and marginal voices in the societies they serve, nurturing an ambition that far outstrips survival."
"37",37,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/4-ways-men-can-support-their-female-colleagues-remotely","leadership.txt","Remote work during the crisis has exacerbated previous gender inequities at home, which has real ramifications in the workplace. Mothers are more likely to do most of the household labor, childcare, and home-schooling coordination, spending as much as 20 hours a week more compared to co-working fathers. They may be less visible and less available to their colleagues, and more likely to be passed up for stretch assignments or promotion due to gendered assumptions that they’re “too busy” at home. Men must step up and be active allies to women during this time of remote work. First, include and sponsor women. Second, ensure women’s voices are heard in meetings, passing the mic to them when you can. Third, practice transparency by sharing information and processes that are hidden from women. Finally, evenly distribute virtual office housework, like note taking and committee work, and encourage women to say “no” more often. Everyday gender biases and barriers remain a persistent problem in office culture. But men with a keen awareness of how women experience the workplace and how gender inequities torpedo profitability and mission outcomes can actively deploy strategies to overcome them. In the in-person work environment, these strategies include ensuring that women have a seat (and a nameplate) at the table; confronting other men when they make biased or sexist statements, including to women in team social events; and validating and normalizing women’s experiences in the moment. Men now have to adapt these strategies for the remote workplace. Consider the obstacles working women are dealing with during the Covid-19 pandemic. Remote work has exacerbated previous gender inequities at home, which in turn has had ramifications in the workplace. Mothers are more likely to do most of the household labor, childcare, and home schooling, spending as much as 20 hours a week more compared to co-working fathers. Women report feeling they need to be “always on,” concerned that their job performance will be negatively evaluated, and unable to confide in colleagues about remote-work challenges. All of this leads to increased stress, burnout, job uncertainty, and financial insecurity. Of notable concern, one in four women are considering downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce altogether because of the strains that working remotely during the pandemic has put on them. Given their added domestic burdens, and the persistent motherhood penalty for women with children, women currently face more headwinds than men in the workplace. For instance, because of demands from children and ambient noise at home, they have to mute themselves on video calls, making themselves appear less visible and less available. Because of gendered assumptions about their too burdened at home to consider a new stretch assignment or promotion, they can also be stymied in their career advancement. World-class ally-ship at this moment requires an astute understanding of how and why women are uniquely affected in the remote environment, and the motivation to adapt key ally actions to the work-from-home world. Here are four strategies that male allies can deploy now to empower women and stem the loss of talented women from the workforce. Include and sponsor women. Women in male-centric environments can experience belonging uncertainty even in normal work conditions. Many women receive subtle — or sometimes overt — signals that they are not part of the team, and that no one has their backs. Because women’s conceptions of themselves often are highly defined by interpersonal relationships, such exclusion experiences can cause loneliness and attrition from the workplace. Diminished face time during remote work may exacerbate this sense of isolation and create uncertainty about advancement opportunities among female colleagues. Share your time generously with the women you work with. Reach out and inquire how they are faring in the remote-work situation. Invite conversation, check in often, and get back to them quickly when they reach out with questions or issues. Instead of an open-door policy, have an “open-phone/video-conference” policy, making it clear you’re available for impromptu conversations. Be purposeful, too, in your sponsorship and advocacy. Recent research shows that only 23% of senior men are sponsoring women while in the remote-work environment. Even fewer are sponsoring women of color. With more women considering leaving the workforce, more men need to talk about the great work women are doing and the excellent results they are producing, to overtly reinforce their value to the organization. Ensure women’s voices are heard in meetings. Be aware of the tendency for men to dominate conversations in virtual meetings, pitches to clients, formal presentations, and everyday discussions. Some women are socialized from an early age to hold back until there is a clear break in the conversation, which can be even more challenging in the remote-work environment. Others have been spoken over so often on a call or Zoom meeting that they’ve simply quit trying. In virtual meetings, we tend to reward the fastest and loudest participants (often men) and don’t deliberately make space for other voices. Next time you are in a virtual meeting, look for an opportunity to toss the conversation over to a woman on your team and acknowledge her as an expert in a given topic: “Anyway, that’s my two cents, but Mary has way more experience in this area than I do. What do you think, Mary?” Or, notice when a talented woman hasn’t contributed to the conversation and ask her a specific question to pull her voice in: “I know Patrice has done work in this area before. I’d love to hear your thoughts, Patrice,” or “You always have such interesting perspectives on these questions, Tanya. I’m really curious what your take is.” Be authentic and say it because you mean it. Practice transparency. Male allies pull back the curtain on information and processes that often are hidden from women. Because we communicate less during remote work, it’s easier for women, in particular, to miss important information and decisions that affect their jobs. During the pandemic, key business decisions to close or reopen physical offices and manufacturing facilities, changes to remote work policies, domestic and international travel plans, and knee-jerk paid leave policy changes have left employees feeling anxious and dissatisfied. The nature of remote work requires a deliberate communication plan to provide regular (and more frequent) updates on key business and personnel decisions, and the company’s status. When intel is less accessible to women, whether it concerns pay, benefits, flex-work arrangements, or promotion opportunities, this perpetuates gender inequities in the workplace. If such intel is being transmitted in private conversations, emails, and video gatherings, be sure to pass it along to women who are not on the invite list. More broadly, consider how this information could be discussed in open settings such as virtual town halls, Zoom meetings, virtual lunches, online fireside chats, and webinars. Evenly distribute virtual office housework. Recent research shows that women volunteer for non-promotable tasks more than men and are far more likely to be directly asked to take them on. While some of the common office housework — getting the coffee or planning the social gathering — has evaporated, be attuned to who gets assigned committee work, note-taking, the planning and organizing of virtual events, tracking of administrative requirements, and the leading of employee-resource groups. Say something when office housework is regularly directed to a female colleague, or volunteer to do it yourself. Work to develop a fair and equitable approach to distributing mundane virtual meeting chores and annoying administrative duties that detract from more career-enhancing activities. Maybe, for both men and women, it’s a simple rotational schedule that fairly determines who takes notes, monitors time, or produces the next meeting agenda. Also, encourage the women you work with to say “no” more often. Consider having a collegial conversation over a Zoom coffee break with women who seem to be raising their hand too often for virtual housework. Tell them what you’re noticing, talk about the career-progression ramifications, and encourage them to be selective and practice saying “no,” even if it feels uncomfortable. Then, have their backs when they decline one of these non-promotable “opportunities.” Leaders and managers —and the majority of men in most industries — are at a crossroads. We must decide to take personal action to evolve and improve ally-ship behaviors in remote workplaces so that talented women are retained and advanced. Anything short of this commitment will undermine recent gains in gender diversity. To achieve gender equity as we continue to live through this pandemic, the first step is to cultivate an awareness and understanding of the unique remote-work challenges that women confront now on a daily basis."

If you’re on the latter side of that equation, here’s are a few things you can do to connect. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. Years ago, one of my students asked me to be his mentor. I was teaching a graduate leadership course in Seattle, and about a week after the class had ended, he asked. It was clear that the question was difficult for him. Throughout the course, he appeared disinterested in my teaching, aloof, and often scoffed at the materials I presented. I’d assumed that he didn’t like the course — or me. But what caught me off guard that day was his sincerity. He explained that he’d had some bad experiences with mentors in the past. He came to realize that the people he had reached out to and admired weren’t genuinely interested in helping him grow, and they usually wanted something in return: free labor, an ego boost, the chance to feel important. Trusting someone he wanted to learn from was still difficult, but he’d found the courage to ask me anyway. His vulnerability was disarming. I’d never been formally asked to “mentor” anyone and I felt like a fraud. I feared that if he knew my many flaws and insecurities, I’d end up being yet another disappointment. Reluctantly, I agreed and decided I could simply hide those parts of myself. It wasn’t until months later, when we had built a foundation of trust, that I felt comfortable enough to follow his example. Sick of carrying around my angst, I confessed my fears about being the “perfect” mentor. As it turned out, the last thing he wanted was my perfection. He wanted me to be human, to see how I dealt with my shortfalls, and grew to trust me more because I acknowledged them. I tell this story because I understand how complicated relationships between different generations can be in academic and professional settings. We spend a great deal of time comparing what we each have to offer — to one another and to the world. In academia, young students want professors to help them make sense of the world, while their professors are worried about keeping up with their publishing demands. At work, many emerging leaders feel those senior to them stand in their way, while those in senior roles privately question their relevance in the face of younger, tech-savvy newcomers. The irony is that the legacy of older leaders is only secured through helping the young ones reach their potential. And the opportunity to fulfill your potential as a young leader can be realized much more fully if you make an effort to inherit the wisdom your predecessors. We need each other to feel like we both matter. If a senior leader you want to connect with hasn’t figured that out yet, there are ways to help them, as my mentee helped me. Of course, all generations have more work to do in this area. These connections can only be made if both sides build bridges and make an effort to understand our mutual wants and differences. But right now, I want to empower you, the young leader, with a few tools that I’ve seen help lay the foundation. Test your assumptions and labels. Chances are, if you’ve struggled to connect with a particular older leader, you’ve formed biases about them. You may have interpreted some of their behavior as off-putting, unapproachable, or disinterested in you. While your concerns may very well be valid, it’s also important to check yourself before completely writing them off. I initially interpreted my student’s aloofness as disinterest, when in fact, it was the opposite. You may be surprised by what you find when you dig a little deeper. Before shutting the door on a relationship with an older employee, put yourself in their shoes. Could you be misinterpreting where they are coming from? Are you projecting some of your own anxiety or misgivings onto them? If you have any connection with someone who knows them better, check in with them to find out more to test your beliefs. Make sure that your criteria for judging their behavior isn’t based on how similar or different they are from you. The things that are different about them may end up being the most valuable. Use vulnerability, not just confidence, to build credibility. Many emerging leaders feel the best way to win the approval of older leaders is to appear confident, smart, and assertive. But that can backfire, coming across as entitled or overly self-assured. After asking me to be his mentor, my graduate student went on to confess that his behavior during our class was his way of trying to prove that he didn’t need help. He told me, “It’s funny, I was looking to be developed and led by trying to convince both of us that I needed neither.” His humility deeply impressed me. What will show more seasoned leaders your maturity and credibility is being vulnerable – openly talking about what you don’t know, asking for help in places you feel unsure, and acknowledging areas you need to improve. While that may feel risky, older leaders know that there’s only so much legitimately earned confidence someone early in their career will have. Faking more than you have will only make others less likely to trust you. Demonstrating that you know your limitations by being confident enough to ask for help indicates you are trustworthy and open to learning. If you are struggling with a project, for instance, you might say, “I’d love to get your input on this. I’m feeling really good about these parts, but I haven’t had enough experience in this area and I know that it’s your expertise.” Avoid complete deference. On the other hand, extreme deference can create distance. In some cases, it can make you come across as a suck up. In others, it establishes a formality that makes senior leaders feel as though they always have to “be on” when they are around you. Believe it or not, deference triggers a sense of imposter syndrome, a fear many older leaders have (that they aren’t worthy of the role they are in). This was my struggle in my relationship with my graduate student. You want to be someone older leaders can feel safe with, who they can be themselves around. When leaders across generations can learn to be vulnerable with one another, it can be transformational. Find common ground. What many emerging leaders long for is to feel respected by older leaders. Creating “peership” with older leaders — approaching them as equals without being cocky and showing respect for their seniority without being overly deferent — is one of the hardest parts of these relationships. To establish mutuality, learn about their lives outside of work. If they have pictures of their family in their office, ask about them. Or, if you’re on a video call and one of their kids walks in the room, use that chance to learn more about their life. Find out what interests they have outside of work. When my student and I were first getting to know each other, I was still a newcomer to Seattle. My family and I were steeped in boxes from our move to the new city and he offered to help. As we unpacked boxes of books in my office, he asked about my clients and the work I did. It became a ritual for us to sit on the floor in front of the bookcase and tell stories of leaders facing real-life challenges. Shared humanity is a great way to establish common ground, setting the foundation for a strong relationship. It also helps neutralize any hierarchical differences without ignoring them. You can show respect for your differences in experience by asking about their career choices and how they’ve approached their development. Ask for what you need. As simple as it sounds, seasoned leaders love when younger leaders cut to the chase and ask for what they want. If you want more time with someone, ask for it within reason. You probably can’t get an hour a week, but you might get an hour a month. If you want more opportunities to have your ideas heard, ask for it. You can say, “I know our meetings are very full, but sharing my ideas is an area I need to grow in. Sometimes we move so fast that I don’t feel comfortable jumping into the fray. I wonder if we could set aside 15 minutes in an upcoming meeting for me to share an idea and engage the team?” If you fear your request will be denied, you’re not alone. Many emerging leaders are afraid of the feeling of rejection that comes with that denial. Instead of personalizing silence, or a “no” answer, ask the other person to help you understand. Whatever their response, they likely have your best interest in mind. You may have to ask several times to make something happen. This is why you should always ask with a level of respect, and explain why your request makes sense. Any hint of insistence, entitlement, or sulking if your request isn’t granted, is more likely to be met with resistance. Remember that your desire to connect with more experienced colleagues — to learn from them, to offer something in return, and to broaden your network beyond your peers — is worthy and admirable. Learning how to make those desires known to senior leaders takes practice, but it’s a skill you will use all your life. It may feel risky, and at times, it will feel uncomfortable. But that discomfort is the same thing that will make your relationship go from enjoyable to transformational. You can start small. Who is a more experienced professional or leader that you admire? Someone you’d want to emulate? Whose career has made you think differently about your own? Reach out to them, let them know how they, and their work have influenced you, and ask for a 20-minute virtual coffee. Prepare one or two questions to ask them. Keep it friendly and informal. Let them feel enjoyed, and help them to enjoy you. Some of the greatest relationships of our lives start with a simple question over a cup of coffee.

"39",39,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/serious-leaders-need-self-care-too","leadership.txt","Despite the well-known benefits, many leaders remain resistant to the whole idea of self-care. This resistance often stems from a feeling that self-care is a sign of weakness, a feeling that they just don’t have time, or just generally rolling their eyes at the entire concept. Based on her experience as a leadership coach, the author offers several suggestions to help leaders see the benefits of self-care, as well as some concrete strategies to incorporate self-care practices into your daily routine. The benefits of self-care are well known. Yet when I work with my leadership clients, I often get major pushback around the whole idea. Why are many leaders so resistant to taking a bit of time for themselves? It usually boils down to misperceptions around what good leadership is, what self-care is, and how self-care actually works. Luckily, I’ve also found that with some thoughtful introspection, it’s possible for even the most skeptical among us to overcome those misconceptions and learn to reap the benefits of self-care. Below, I consider the three most common excuses my clients give for their resistance to self-care, and offer some solutions to help leaders overcome that resistance. Some of my clients find the entire concept of self-care to be antithetical to their image of what a “serious” leader looks like. They roll their eyes at the whole idea of meditation, mindfulness, chants, “anything that involves candles,” nature walks, and “slowing down.” Others trivialize taking time for yourself as an “indulgence” — maybe others enjoy it, but it’s a luxury they feel they can’t afford. How can we start to challenge these limiting beliefs? To start, I work with my clients to reframe self-care as an investment that can increase their overall productivity and effectiveness as a leader. A data-driven approach is often the most convincing, and the research is clear that diet, exercise, sleep, and emotional regulation promote health and well-being. Specifically, a healthy diet has been linked to better moods, higher energy levels, and lower levels of depression. Aerobic exercise increases blood flow, boosting both learning and memory. Getting good sleep has been linked to increased focus, improved cognitive function (including creativity and innovation), greater capacity for learning, and improved empathy. To refocus on the tangible benefits of self-care, I’ll often ask clients the following questions: More often than not, when I broach the topic of self-care or even taking a break, my clients respond with some version of, “Are you kidding me?!? I’m already way beyond capacity looking after my team and my family, trying to organize home schooling, emotionally supporting my friends, colleagues, family … I don’t have time for that!” This feeling of constant stress is sadly all too common among today’s endlessly busy leaders. Unfortunately, when we’re stressed, neuroscience tells us that our amygdala — the area of the brain responsible for our evolutionary fight-or-flight response — kicks in, diverting resources from the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for logical reasoning, problem solving, decision making, and willpower. In other words, it is precisely when we’re feeling stressed and overwhelmed that we would most benefit from slowing down in order to think big, innovate, and solve the problems that are stressing us out. This too is thoroughly backed by research. Studies show that taking breaks can help prevent decision fatigue, renew and strengthen motivation, increase productivity and creativity, and consolidate memory and improve learning. Even short “micro-breaks” can improve focus and productivity. As we think about the stress-induced “I don’t have time” objection, it’s useful to ask: Some of my clients come in to coaching thinking that as a leader, they must never show any vulnerability. Recently, I worked with a client who explained that she expected herself — and any “self-respecting” leader — to have all the answers. “Otherwise,” she asked, “why would anyone follow me?!” The belief that practicing self-care is a sign of weakness combines with the notion that showing weakness makes you a bad leader to create serious resistance to even exploring these practices. To combat my client’s limiting beliefs, we needed to explore her preconceptions about what it meant to be a leader, delving into the power of vulnerability and the opportunities we can create when we rely on others. As she began to acknowledge the importance of delegation and asking for help, she was able to see that self-care was actually the key to becoming a more effective leader. If you’re struggling to shift your notions of what “good” leadership looks like, try asking yourself these questions: Once you begin to overcome your initial resistance, it’s time to start thinking about how to integrate self-care into your daily routine. Here are a few strategies that have been effective for my clients: Make peace with self-care (or whatever you want to call it). Acknowledging your resistance is the first step to overcoming it. For example, one leader I worked with associated self-care with long meditations sitting cross-legged on the floor, complete with incense and chants, which he found completely repellant. Once we got past that misconception, we were able to arrive at a more meaningful understanding of self-care — for him, it consisted of a morning journaling exercise, a brief afternoon nature walk, and 15 minutes of kid-free jazz in the evening. Make it your own. Understand that self-care is as individual as the person practicing it, so it can take many different forms. You may not be a spa person, but perhaps you get a boost from nature. Talking on the phone may be draining, but pulling out a sketch pad or a crossword puzzle might reenergize you (or vice versa!). Make it micro. Short diversions can provide a powerful boost. One of my clients sets a daily alarm for a five-minute loving kindness meditation, which he finds centers him amidst his “many storms brewing.” Try an online mindfulness meditation to improve emotional regulation, journaling to promote self-awareness, creative writing to increase well-being and creativity, reaching out to someone you haven’t spoken with in a while to increase your social connectedness, a gratitude exercise or an act of kindness to promote positivity, or a walk around the block to get your blood flowing. Make time in your agenda. Once you’ve come up with a plan, put it in your calendar to make it official! If you’re not sure what exactly you want to do, you can start by simply identifying two 10-minute blocks every day, setting your alarm, and then choosing a new self-care activity to try out during each time block. Experiment. You’ll never get it exactly perfect the first time. Once you’ve started, think about what’s working for you, and what you might want to change or add to your routine. You can also look to your peers and colleagues for inspiration. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel — if something they’re doing sounds appealing to you, borrow it and make it your own. Once you’re got it, share it. As a leader, you set the tone for your people. So share what’s worked for you, and make it clear through both words and actions that you know the importance of taking care of yourself. If you’re open about your investments into self-care, your team and your entire organization will follow your lead. *** Self-care begins with you. It comes in many shapes and sizes, but done consciously and consistently, it gives you the tools you need to become a better leader and a happier, healthier person. If you want to become the best version of yourself — and inspire those around you to do the same — investing in your own well-being is worth making time for."
"40",40,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/todays-leaders-need-vulnerability-not-bravado","leadership.txt","Contrary to popular belief, the omnipotent, macho-style effective leaders are not the ones who can best guide their countries or organizations through difficult, uncertain times. Rather the most effective leaders are the ones who are willing to show their vulnerabilities — who can admit to themselves and others when they are wrong and what they know and don’t know.  To cultivate that style of leadership, start by telling the truth; ask for help; go outside your comfort zone; when you make a mistake, admit it and apologize; and engage others in your journey of self-improvement. Few myths are as pervasive as the notion that leaders ought to appear tough and confident. Or at least, that was the case prior to the current pandemic, which has exposed the many weaknesses of forceful, dominant leaders and highlighted the superiority of those who have the courage to reveal their vulnerabilities. Consider how Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, and Jair Bolsonaro dismissed the virus, displayed fearless bravado, and undermined the calls to wear a mask or socially distance, putting others at risk. Contrast this with the candid and data-driven approach taken by Angela Merkel, Jacinda Ardern, or Sanna Marin, which saved thousands of lives and mitigated the economic damage to Germany, New Zealand, and Finland. People in organizations of all types are better off when their leaders are smart, honest, and caring when taking bold, potentially unpopular actions — when their focus is on helping the organization move forward, not on how they look and certainly not on creating a false sense of invincibility that actually harms people. In a complex and uncertain world that demands constant learning and agility, the most apt and adaptable leaders are those who are aware of their limitations, have the necessary humility to grow their own and others’ potential, and are courageous and curious enough to create sincere and open connections with others. They build inclusive team climates with psychological safety that foster constructive criticism and dissent. Above all, they embrace truth: They are more interested in understanding reality than in being right and are not afraid to accept that they were wrong. This allows them to welcome criticism — not because they like it any more than the rest of us, but because they know it’s necessary in order to make progress. Altogether, this is a very different type than the macho-style leader who is rarely right yet seldom in doubt. There are leaders who have excelled because of their vulnerable style. One is Oprah Winfrey, who became the first black female billionaire in history thanks to a multitalented entrepreneurial career that put vulnerability and authenticity at the center, living her life “inside out.” Another is Satya Nadella who resurrected Microsoft by transforming its culture based on his own core drivers: humility, curiosity, and constant learning. And a third is Howard Schultz: When he returned to Starbucks in 2007, after the business experienced a substantial decline, he opened up with his employees and was transparent about his challenges and vulnerabilities, which helped drive a return to growth. Although they and others like them have been admired, vulnerable leaders collectively haven’t received the widespread public attention and accolades that macho, heroic leaders have garnered. What can you do to cultivate a more vulnerable style of leadership? Here are some suggestions: Start by telling the truth. Share your candid perspective with others, what you know, and what you don’t know. Although it is easy to tell people what they want to hear, the best leaders tell people the truth, no matter how traumatic. When you are clear about the challenges ahead, you help your team. Being open about your weaknesses is the ultimate sign of strength. Ask for help. Leadership is not heroic. It is not about the actual person in charge; rather, it is unlocking the forces that bring people together as a team. This requires you to be honest about your vulnerabilities and your need for their support. This authenticity will increase their commitment to you and will unleash their ideas and energy to tackle the challenges at hand. It will make your team stronger. Go outside your comfort zone. One of the reasons so many people fail to develop into highly effective leaders is that they stagnate, operating on autopilot, self-perpetuating their habits, and repeating what has worked in the past. This is why playing to your own strengths can be a recipe for disaster: Unless you work on your defects, you won’t develop new skills. Yes, this will make you seem vulnerable in the short term, because your performance will always suffer when you are learning a new skill or behavior. But it can only make you stronger in the long term. When you make a mistake, admit it and apologize. When you do so, no matter how disappointed people are, they will appreciate your honesty and trust you more than if you lie to them. The short-term sense of invincibility you may experience when you refrain from admitting your mistakes is (a) short-lived and (b) delusional. Failing to admit you were wrong is an ineffective strategy to persuade others that you are right, and when this strategy fails, people will question not only your judgment but also your self-awareness. Engage others in your journey of self-improvement. Over our coaching and consulting careers, we have seen a few leaders who were so serious about their personal development plan that they openly shared their feedback (360s, performance reviews, upward feedback, etc.) with their teams. “Look, I am not very good at giving feedback and developing others’ performance,” one of them said to their team. “So from now on I am committing to communicating more, mentoring others, and helping my team members advance their careers, in the hope that this will improve my leadership skills.” In short, vulnerable leadership in a world of extreme uncertainty and interdependence is vital to making progress when answers are not clear cut and anyone in the organization may be able to contribute vital knowledge or ideas. As one of us (Amy) noted in her book The Fearless Organization, “For knowledge work to flourish, the workplace must be one where people feel able to share their knowledge!”"
"41",41,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/how-men-can-confront-other-men-about-sexist-behavior","leadership.txt","Confronting other men for sexism, bias, harassment, and all manner of inappropriate behavior may be the toughest part of male allyship. But it’s also utterly essential. While the prospect of speaking up against transgressions can feel overwhelming, there are steps you can take to make it easier. Within two seconds of hearing an inappropriate comment, call it out — even if it’s just saying “Ouch.” When you say something, own it. Use I-statements to signal that the behavior didn’t land the right way with you. Alternatively, try Socratic questions to disrupt gender bias and trigger self-reflection, or share what you’ve learned through a personal experience or relationship. Humor can also work now and then, particularly if you have an existing relationship with a male coworker. Finally, show him that you’re on his side and follow up with positive reinforcement. Globally, most men support gender equality and believe they are contributing in meaningful ways. While some men may be doing their part in interpersonal allyship — mentorships and other professional relationships and support to push women forward — few are helping with public allyship — becoming courageous watchdogs for equity, dignity, respect, and fairness in the workplace. Perhaps this explains evidence showing that 77% of men believe they are doing all they can to support gender equality, while only 41% of women agree. That means men must do more to speak up and speak out when they see bad behavior. Active confrontation of other men for sexism, bias, harassment, and all manner of inappropriate behavior may be the toughest part of male allyship. It is also utterly essential. For many men, challenging masculine workplace norms is where the cost of allyship gets real in a hurry. We define confrontation this way: Bringing sexism and exclusion of women to the attention of men who knowingly or unknowingly instigate and perpetuate these attitudes and outcomes in their words and actions. Why is it so important that men stand willing to confront other men when they demean, offend, or harass — even if it’s unintentional? There are several reasons. First, women who call out bad male behavior often are evaluated negatively, even rated as less competent compared to a man that does the same. Second, when a man (someone without an apparent vested interest in gender fairness and equity) confronts bias or sexism, observers are more likely to be persuaded. Third, how a message is received is often less about precise wording and more about the in-group identity of the speaker. A confrontation intended to change attitudes and behavior has more impact when it comes from someone perceived to be similar — in this case, another man who can claim, “That’s not who we [men] are” and “That’s not what we [guys] do.” Finally, quite often, men fear they’re the only guy in the room who objects to a sexist comment or raunchy joke (though evidence shows lots of men are offended), so they stay silent when they could break the spell and enable other male allies to find their voice if only they’d speak up. While the prospect of speaking up against transgressions can feel overwhelming, there are steps you can take to make it easier. Drawn from our research for our new book Good Guys, here are six confrontation strategies you can apply right now in your interactions at work: Use the two-second rule. The well-documented bystander effect too often plays out in the workplace when men stay on the sidelines, timid and mute in the face of obvious gender bias and sexism. To combat the paralysis that sets in mere seconds after another man delivers a sexist comment or demeaning joke, just say something! We recommend the ouch technique: Simply say “Ouch!” clearly and forcefully. This buys you a few extra seconds to formulate a clear statement about why the comment didn’t land well with you. Then, have some ready responses cued up in advance, such as: When you say something, own it. When you confront another man, don’t attribute your concern or offense to the fact that there’s a woman in the room or that women might be offended. Too often we hear half-hearted confrontations such as, “Come on, Bob. There are women in the room.” This implies that Bob’s sexist comment would be acceptable if no women were in sight. Instead, use clear I-statements to signal that the behavior didn’t land the right way with you, such as, “I didn’t find that joke amusing, Bob. I don’t appreciate the way it demeans women,” or “I’d really appreciate it if you’d stop referring to our female colleagues as ‘girls.’ They are women.” Use Socratic questions as a confrontation device. Quite often, a Socratic question can serve both to disrupt gender bias and trigger self-reflection in a male colleague. For instance, many women have experienced having a creative idea ignored during a meeting, only to have it repackaged by a male before the meeting ends. Next time you bear witness to such co-opting of a female colleague’s idea, ask a thoughtful question designed to remind everyone in the room — including the offender — who generated the idea in the first place: “I’m confused, Charles. How is that any different from what Amber suggested a few minutes ago?” The Socratic question can also be quite effective in helping a male colleague consider an alternative perspective. Lisen Stromberg of Prismwork Consulting recommends something as simple as, “I wonder if you’ve considered that women might experience this differently?” Share what you’ve learned through a personal experience or relationship. Sometimes, confrontation through self-disclosure can be a powerful approach. Sharing authentically how bias or sexism was harmful to someone close to you can cause other men to do a double take, seeing their own behavior through a new lens. Saying, calmly but firmly, “My wife experienced this at work, and it’s unacceptable! I don’t want women to experience that here,” can be deeply influential for other men. You can even make this aspirational by connecting this feedback to who he wants to be by saying, “I know you’re a good guy, and I wouldn’t want you to inadvertently offend women by suggesting they should smile more.” Use humor now and then. Particularly when you have an existing relationship with a male coworker or peer, try a short humorous observation as an intervention. For instance, when a guy calls a female colleague “sweetheart,” try, “Do you call all your software developers ‘sweetheart’?” Or, when a team member regularly interrupts your female colleague in a meeting, try some sports-related humor. Toss a yellow sticky note on the table, and say, “Penalty! That’s 10 yards for interrupting.” Show him that you’re on his side. Creating real behavior change in other men is best achieved through an artful blend of challenge and reinforcement. A group of real allies can turn confrontation into “carefrontation” as one informal group of executive leaders shared with us. So, when a guy goes off the rails with sexism or harassing humor, first, use language that lets him know you see him as part of your tribe and that your heart is in the right place. Pull him aside after a meeting and have a direct conversation. Show that you are worried about him; use I-statements that aren’t accusatory, but also let him know how you feel as a friend and colleague. In clarifying the precise behavior of concern, be specific in the details, situation, and people involved. You don’t have to take the conversation to “DEFCON 5,” but you do have to make him understand how his behavior is hurting others, sabotaging his credibility, and why you care. Then, when he shows some gender awareness or an inclusive mindset, be sure to follow up with some positive reinforcement. Confronting other men about their missteps is not about humiliation, shaming, or angry altercations. And there is no one-size-fits-all approach. At times, a private conversation after the meeting will get a more positive result, especially if the perpetrator is a close colleague, open to feedback, and well-meaning but naïve, or out of step with changing attitudes and expectations. At other times it is essential to confront in public, especially if the comment or behavior was egregious and likely to dispirit coworkers and damage the relational environment, or if the perpetrator is a serial offender, rigid in his attitudes toward women, and unlikely to respond to private corrective feedback. Allyship is hard work. It takes a deft touch and a thoughtful and empathetic ally to create lasting and meaningful change. Excellent allies have the courage to get comfortable doing the uncomfortable work of disrupting the status quo."

In this piece, the author provides a simple framework to help guide leaders through these difficult decisions. By interrogating the ethics (what is viewed as acceptable in your organization or society), morals (your internal sense of right and wrong), and responsibilities associated with your specific role, you can begin to understand how different courses of action align with these different values, and make informed decisions when they inevitably come into conflict. While there are no easy answers, proactively thinking about your decisions through these three distinct lenses — and recognizing where your past actions may have been inconsistent with these values — is the key to leading with integrity. Many decision-making frameworks aim to help leaders use objective information to mitigate bias, operate under time pressure, or leverage data. But these frameworks tend to fall short when it comes to decisions based on subjective information sources that suggest conflicting courses of action. And most complex decisions fall into this category. Specifically, every complex leadership decision must balance three subjective dimensions: Unsurprisingly, these considerations often come into conflict. When this happens, there are no easy answers — but by carefully interrogating these three dimensions, leaders can move forward with confidence that the decisions they make reflect the best possible balance among their different principles. Consider a CEO facing the decision of whether or not to lay off employees during a recession. Filtered through the lens of morality, she might feel that taking away an individual’s livelihood in such a hard time would be immoral. Ethics, however, demand that leaders weigh the tradeoff between the wellbeing of a smaller number of individuals and the potential for risk to the entire organization. And if she believes her role requires her to protect the interests of as many of the organization’s key stakeholders as possible — including shareholders, employees, customers, and community members — then she may conclude that her job demands that she lay off employees to protect the majority of the organization. This suggests that the requirements of her role align with her ethics but conflict with her personal morality. This simplifies the decision down to a choice between 1) attempting to persuade key stakeholders to align the expectations of her role with her personal morality; or 2) sacrificing her individual views for the greater good. Adding further complexity to difficult decisions like this one is the fact that none of the three dimensions are static. As recently as 2014, for example, an apolitical approach was broadly perceived as the right ethical framework for leaders; today, many employees and consumers demand that leaders take a strong stance on social issues. Leaders must continuously update their understanding of the ethical framework demanded by their current context. Staying abreast of these ethical shifts — and understanding the rationales behind them — may inspire leaders to investigate and adapt their own views accordingly as well. In particular, surrounding yourself with a diverse team that elicits different perspectives based on different experiences, values, or education will help you to continuously refine your own moral code. Finally, your role (and your understanding of that role) is likely to change many times over the course of your career. Are you obligated to all stakeholders equally? What results do different stakeholders expect and whose expectations are most important? Should employees, customers, and communities be treated with the same regard as owners and investors? These are all questions that will have to be evaluated and reevaluated as your roles evolves. Learning to recognize and balance these dynamic priorities is key to leading with integrity. There aren’t any shortcuts, but actively investigating your own values and seeking — or driving — alignment between at least two of the three corners of the morals-ethics-role triangle will give you the tools you need to make the difficult decisions that all leaders face. Below, I offer five sets of questions to ask yourself that will help you better understand, develop, and articulate your ethical, moral, and role responsibilities. Without judgment, only observation, ask yourself: For example, the CEO grappling with laying off employees during a downturn might articulate her desire to be experienced as both savvy and compassionate, her belief that business exists to generate wealth for individuals and communities, her view that the purpose of her specific business is to improve people’s quality of life, and her understanding that fulfilling these goals requires the business to be profitable. Again, without judgment, only observation, ask yourself: After embracing her desire to be experienced as both compassionate and savvy, the CEO might recognize that there have been some situations in the past where she asserted one characteristic more than the other. This reflection could lead her to conclude that she actually values one of those traits more than the other, or it could lead her to conclude that her past actions have been inconsistent with her morals, ethics, and/or role responsibilities, and that future actions should align more closely with these values. Consider the following: In the case of the layoffs decision, the CEO can see that the expectations of her role are aligned with her ethical context, but she is unable to reconcile this with her personal moral code. She is therefore left with a small range of options: ignore her role responsibilities (a choice she can make only once, as it’s likely to lead to her removal as CEO); sacrifice her morality (a descent into hypocrisy which few can stomach); attempt to influence key stakeholders to shift their expectations of her role to align with her morality; or recalibrate her understanding of her own morality to align with her role responsibilities and ethics. Consider the following: In these situations, nuance does not work to your advantage. It’s natural to have mixed emotions, but as a leader, you must send a clear, consistent message. Articulate what you stand for with clarity, and people will understand the decision — even if they don’t like it. Even if the CEO genuinely feels sadness, anger, or disappointment at the prospect of laying off her employees, she must avoid a defensive focus on her own feelings and instead center her communication around the reasons for the decision and how they align with the morals, ethics, and role responsibilities she has always held. This is the hardest part. Now that you’ve completed the exercise, ask yourself: This process isn’t easy. In fact, research has demonstrated that people with a weaker sense of morality tend to have an easier time reconciling these high-stakes dilemmas, potentially helping to explain the prevalence of leaders with psychopathic tendencies. But that’s all the more reason to invest in understanding and cultivating your own values, ensuring that you serve as a force for good in an arena rife with less-than-moral players. The more you explore your own decision-making framework in the abstract, the better equipped you will be to make tough calls when the job requires it. Each of these decisions will help you further sharpen your understanding of your underlying morals, the role that you are fulfilling, and the ethical context in which you are operating — just in time to make your next difficult choice.

"43",43,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/ceos-dont-let-fear-and-paranoia-sink-your-leadership","leadership.txt","As executives rise to power, they are apt to become arrogant. They also, perhaps surprisingly, tend to become more fearful — they hate the idea that they might appear to be vulnerable or incompetent, and they get paranoid about the colleagues around them. This arrogance and the underlying fear make them less effective. The author shares a story from his own career to illustrate this point — a time when he felt frozen about what to do and foolish for feeling that way. To his surprise, when he was honest about his confusion with colleagues, they came to his aid. Three steps can help executives manage the tendencies toward arrogance and fearfulness: getting out of the C suite, trusting colleagues more than they’re inclined to, and giving people enough attention. For decades, we’ve told CEOs to be humble. It’s fine to be confident, even fiercely determined, we say, but arrogance will bring you down. The ideal leader respects and listens to colleagues, communicates honestly, adjusts opinions when confronted with new evidence, and makes decisions that strengthen the organization rather than his or her own position. The problem is that everything else in corporate life pushes CEOs in the opposite direction. To rise in the organization, executives have to focus relentlessly on themselves. If they win the tournament, they gain power and prestige that isolates them. Arrogance is almost inevitable, as is (somewhat paradoxically) paranoia. When consultant Roger Jones interviewed dozens of CEOs and other senior executives, he kept seeing the same five deep-seated fears. They worried about appearing to be incompetent, vulnerable, and foolish; they worried about under-achieving; and they feared political attacks from their colleagues. None of these top-of-mind fears involved the businesses or the organizations they led. The leaders were caught up in themselves, and their fears were limiting their effectiveness. Jones’s findings struck me powerfully because of a difficult experience I had more than a decade ago. I had been a rising manager at Prologis, a fast-growing industrial real estate company (think warehouses for lease) in the S&P 500. In 2004, I became the chief operating officer, working closely with the CEO. Over time, however, we disagreed about the pace of growth, and I quit in early 2008. Then the financial crisis hit the company hard, the CEO resigned, and the board asked me in November to come back and take his place. Soon after I settled in, our already weak financial position declined further. Matters came to a head during a long evening meeting with the CFO and his staff. Bankruptcy seemed inevitable, but I couldn’t stomach the thought of giving up on the company I had helped to build. Everyone was looking to me for a decision — but I excused myself to walk around and clear my head. Actually, my head was spinning. I managed to grab a chair in another room before fainting. I quickly regained consciousness and returned to the meeting, but I still had no idea what to say. All I could manage was, “I don’t know what to do,” and “I need your help.” It was my worst nightmare — I felt incompetent, vulnerable, and foolish. (Sound familiar?) But then a remarkable thing happened. After a stunned silence, the CFO and other colleagues essentially said “We’re with you,” and “We’ll figure it out.” Somehow we did. Thanks to a lot of diligence, creative thinking, and luck, we bought enough time with creditors to sell some assets at a decent price and pay down debt. Once we stabilized, we went to work correcting the problems that the growth years had masked — in particular, a culture of deep distrust. My willingness to say that I didn’t know what to do at a key moment actually reduced people’s insecurities and reset expectations. It also liberated me from my own fears, at least for a while. Over the next four years, we rebuilt the company to its former heights and more. Not everything went smoothly — we laid off almost a third of our workforce, which was painful in itself and also slowed down the process of developing trust. But when I retired in 2013, Prologis was solidly profitable and the largest company worldwide in its industry. I don’t recommend my 2008 ordeal to anyone. If I hadn’t built up credibility with the other executives in previous years, my vulnerability might well have blown up in my face. But I do think that CEOs and other senior executives can and should take steps to reduce arrogance and its underlying partner, fear. The key is to reset your workplace emotions through “microclimates” — settings that are free of the pervasive ego-expanding and ego-threatening effects of the job. Here are three steps I recommend to keep the focus off of yourself. The first is to get out of the C suite. I don’t mean traveling, which usually reinforces your exalted status. I made a point of having lunch with a non-executive employee at least once a week. Sometimes we talked about their role in the company, but mostly we chatted about our families, weekend plans, and other pleasures. Neuroscientists have found that we can reduce our fears simply by talking to others. And non-executive employees won’t stimulate paranoia. The second is to trust your colleagues more than you think is wise. Too often what you think is wisdom is really just arrogance and fear talking. In most cases that I intentionally chose to trust a colleague, it was the right decision. I got burned a few times, but the goodwill I generated with this approach more than compensated for the occasional short-term damage. The third is to give people the attention they deserve. It’s a gift that also builds goodwill, and rarely backfires. Not only does it pay off over time with easier conversations later if things get stressful, but it subtly changes your frame of reference. Most executives are quick to give their own opinions, putting subordinates who think differently in a vulnerable position. I forced myself to listen before I chimed in. That helped stimulate a wider range of ideas, which put us in a better position to succeed. And it kept the attention off me. CEOs have lots of ways to improve their performance, from hiring coaches to changing strategies. But the most important might be emotional: Using disciplined practices to overcome the fears — and the arrogance — that dampen their effectiveness.

Here she applies her findings to the present day, and identifies several behaviors that leaders can adopt to support their employees as we all grapple with ongoing disruption. Although the pandemic has plunged us into unforeseen challenges, the author points out that it’s also given leaders an opportunity to reflect on how to actively demonstrate inclusive and supportive behavior for teams and companies. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. The Covid-19 pandemic has separated people from their workplaces, coworkers, and familiar daily routines. In many cases, it has added stress, led to a drop in morale, and fragmented team cohesion — all of which can result in dampened work performance. That’s why actively fostering a sense of inclusion at work is so critical right now. During the early stages of Covid-19 this April, I conducted a study to find out how professionals were reacting to the unanticipated disruption of a global crisis. I surveyed 187 people working in a variety of industries and occupations in New York and New Jersey, the two states most impacted at the outset of Covid-19 in the U.S. By analyzing 253 narratives, I identified some definitive patterns in leadership behavior that gave employees a sense of stability, empowerment, and inclusion despite the crisis. While this research was conducted during the acute early stages of the pandemic, the following recommendations are deeply relevant to our ongoing, and changing, state of crisis. The most frequently cited behaviors (mentioned by 44% of the participants) were recognizing, praising, and otherwise showing appreciation for a person’s work, dedication, effort, and contributions. Some participants mentioned the benefits of small acts of affirmation from their superiors, such as saying thank you for a job well done or sending an email acknowledging their efforts. Others described more visible acts from their leaders, such as talking about an employee’s accomplishments during team meetings, mentioning their work in conversations where managers were present, and giving them opportunities to work more closely with senior leadership. One participant said that even if her supervisor knew that she was not able to focus much on her prior projects due to the pandemic, he would still ask her to share what she was working on currently at a team meeting so her colleagues were aware of and understood how she was contributing. This type of affirmative behavior made participants feel proud and validated during a time when contact with coworkers was limited and fears and uncertainty about job security and the future ran high. When leaders showed an understanding of employees’ needs, preferences, and circumstances when it came to work arrangements, employees felt it provided the individualized support they needed to help them accomplish work goals. This practice (mentioned by 21% of participants) was especially relevant at the beginning of the pandemic and remains true as the crisis continues. People have different family situations, living arrangements, and socioeconomic circumstances, and varying degrees of familiarity with remote-work technology and best practices. Some participants recalled that their leaders regularly checked in with them on how they and their families were doing, showing awareness of their specific challenges and signaling their availability. Some reported bosses and managers met with them one-on-one to provide more direction and redistributed work tasks among team members to accommodate different and changing needs. One survey respondent who experienced a difficult transition to remote work while home schooling said his supervisor told him that he would try his best to help with whatever he needed, including offloading tasks to someone who had the bandwidth. These behaviors reportedly helped people feel less stressed, experience more positive feelings toward their leader and their team, and created an atmosphere of trust and understanding that motivated them to apply themselves more fully to work. In a time of great uncertainty and stress, several participants (15%) noted that they appreciated leaders who sought out, and acted upon, their input. These participants mentioned that their work experience improved when leaders invited them to raise issues immediately, held “what’s your opinion” meetings, included them in discussions of where the group was going, and organized regular open forums for them to ask questions and share their thoughts. They reported feeling trusted, needed, and treated as insiders in their organizations. One participant mentioned that her supervisor asked her to create an assessment process to help make decisions, which signaled to her that she was considered capable, trustworthy, and an integral part of the team. This may seem counterintuitive given that people’s mental bandwidth is often constrained in times of crises and disruptions, but 13% of participants mentioned feeling empowered when they were tasked with new responsibilities even while organizations scrambled to meet the challenges of the pandemic. This included taking on managerial duties when supervisors were overloaded with additional work to lead new initiatives, and being asked to mentor coworkers because of their existing expertise, or their experience with remote work. These new responsibilities gave employees confidence and the opportunity to get to know other colleagues better, making them feel important to the group’s success. There are a few helpful questions leaders can ask themselves in this process: Do you tend to be more inclusive of some people than others? Are there people you are inadvertently leaving out? In other words, do you tend to entrust new tasks to people you are familiar with rather than those who best meet the criteria for a given task or project? Participants (10%) reported important benefits when their leaders created specific opportunities for them to connect and bond with their coworkers. Examples included virtual coffee breaks, happy hours, lunches, time for story sharing, and even games played over Zoom. One participant told me about a regular “thirsty Thursday” meeting where people brought drinks to their virtual team meetings and played games like “Two Truths and a Lie” and trivia, just to loosen things up. These practices helped people get to know each other in an informal setting, helped relieved stress, and motivated them to perform well in their jobs. Another participant said, “If you feel you belong to a team versus as an individual contributor, you are held accountable by peers — which, in my opinion, is more powerful than by your boss — [and] that ‘it isn’t all about money’.” Although the pandemic has plunged us headlong into unforeseen challenges, it’s also given leaders an opportunity to reflect on how to actively demonstrate inclusive and supportive behavior for teams and companies. Some of these recommendations may come more naturally to you than others; but as we continue to grapple with the ongoing reverberations of the pandemic, the best leadership approach is to emphasize the ones where you feel strong, and take time to hone in on and practice those that feel more difficult. Seek out new ways to expand your repertoire of inclusive behaviors by incorporating some new practices. Having to navigate the unforeseen disasters and catastrophes of a pandemic tests leadership; but it can also help you expand your own comfort zone, and by extension, your ability to lead through crises.

"45",45,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/emerging-from-the-crisis","leadership.txt","In times of great uncertainty, it’s difficult to formulate strategies. Leaders can’t draw on experience to address developments no one has ever seen before. Yet the decisions they make now could have ramifications for decades. The practice of strategic foresight offers a solution. Its aim is not to predict the future but to help organizations envision multiple futures in ways that enable them to sense and adapt to change. Its most recognizable tool is scenario planning. To use it well, organizations must imagine a variety of futures, identify strategies that are needed across them, and begin implementing those strategies now. But one-off exercises are not enough: Leaders must institutionalize that process, building a dynamic link between thinking about the future and taking action in the present. In this roundtable discussion, HBR’s editor in chief, Adi Ignatius, leads a conversation among five top executives: the fashion mogul Tory Burch; Geoff Martha, of Medtronic; Nancy McKinstry, who heads the professional information services firm Wolters Kluwer; Chuck Robbins, of Cisco Systems; and Kevin Sneader, of McKinsey & Company. These executives discuss leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic, how the crisis has affected their companies, and how they are responding. They also speculate on what the future might hold for business: more reliance on digital technology, a new relationship with government, and fresh thinking about social inequality, environmental sustainability, and the delivery of health care. The author collaborated with Elisabeth Kübler-Ross on the book On Grief and Grieving, which adapted the five stages of grief from her landmark work in the late 1960s on the five stages of dying: denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, and acceptance. He has since come to believe that grief has a sixth stage—meaning—which can take many forms: remembering the joy that someone or something gave; rituals of remembrance; gratitude; or turning the loss into something positive for others. In this article Kessler advises leaders, managers, and organizations to recognize that people may be experiencing different kinds of grief and to treat them accordingly. The complete Spotlight package is available in a single reprint. Good strategy creates competitive advantage over time, but the uncertainty of the future makes it difficult to identify effective courses of action, particularly in the midst of a crisis. As a leader, how can you prepare for an unpredictable future while managing the urgent demands of the present? The practice of strategic foresight provides the capacity to sense, shape, and adapt to change as it happens. One important element of the practice is scenario planning, which helps leaders navigate uncertainty by teaching them how to anticipate possible futures while still operating in the present. To make effective strategy in the face of uncertainty, leaders need to institutionalize strategic foresight, harnessing the power of imagination to build a dynamic link between planning and operations. How can we formulate strategy in the  face of uncertainty? That’s the fundamental question leaders must ask as they prepare for the future. And in the midst of a global pandemic, answering it has never felt more urgent. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, rapid technological change, growing economic interdependence, and mounting political instability had conspired to make the future increasingly murky. Uncertainty was so all-encompassing that to fully capture the dimensions of the problem, researchers had devised elaborate acronyms such as VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) and TUNA (turbulent, uncertain, novel, and ambiguous). In response, many leaders sought refuge in the more predictable short term—a mechanism for coping with uncertainty that research has shown leaves billions of dollars of earnings on the table and millions of people needlessly unemployed. By the start of 2020, the sense of uncertainty was so pervasive that many executives were doubling down on efficiency at the expense of innovation, favoring the present at the expense of the future. And then the pandemic hit. Now the tyranny of the present is supreme. A lot of organizations have had no choice but to focus on surviving immediate threats. (There are no futurists in foxholes.) But many business and political discussions still demand farsightedness. The stakes are high, and decisions that leaders make now may have ramifications for years—or even decades. As they try to manage their way through the crisis, they need a way to link current moves to future outcomes. So how best to proceed? Strategic foresight—the history, theory, and practice of which I have spent years researching—offers a way forward. Its aim is not to predict the future but rather to make it possible to imagine multiple futures in creative ways that heighten our ability to sense, shape, and adapt to what happens in the years ahead. Strategic foresight doesn’t help us figure out what to think about the future. It helps us figure out how to think about it. To be sure, a growing body of research has demonstrated that it is possible to make more-accurate predictions, even in chaotic fields like geopolitics. We should use those techniques to the extent we can. But when predictive tools reach their limits, we need to turn to strategic foresight, which takes the irreducible uncertainty of the future as a starting point. In that distinctive context, it helps leaders make better decisions. The most recognizable tool of strategic foresight is scenario planning. It involves several stages: identifying forces that will shape future market and operating conditions; exploring how those drivers may interact; imagining a variety of plausible futures; revising mental models of the present on the basis of those futures; and then using those new models to devise strategies that prepare organizations for whatever the future actually brings. Today the use of scenarios is widespread. But all too often, organizations conduct just a single exercise and then set whatever they learn from it on the shelf. If companies want to make effective strategy in the face of uncertainty, they need to set up a process of constant exploration—one that allows top managers to build permanent but flexible bridges between their actions in the present and their thinking about the future. What’s necessary, in short, is not just imagination but the institutionalization of imagination. That is the essence of strategic foresight. Uncertainty stems from our inability to compare the present to anything we’ve previously experienced. When situations lack analogies to the past, we have trouble envisioning how they will play out in the future. The economist Frank Knight famously argued that uncertainty is best understood in contrast with risk. In situations of risk, Knight wrote, we can calculate the probability of particular outcomes, because we have seen many similar situations before. (A life insurance company, for example, has data on enough 45-year-old, nonsmoking white men to estimate how long one of them is going to live.) But in situations of uncertainty—and Knight put most business decisions in this category—we can only guess what might happen, because we lack the experience to gauge the most likely outcome. In fact, we might not even be able to imagine the range of potential outcomes. The key in those situations, Knight felt, was judgment. Managers with good judgment can successfully chart a course through uncertainty despite a lack of reference points. Unfortunately, Knight had no idea where good judgment came from. He called it an “unfathomable mystery.” Of course, in something of a catch-22, conventional wisdom holds that to a large extent good judgment is based on experience. And in many uncertain situations managers do, in fact, turn to historical analogy to anticipate the future. This is why business schools use the case teaching method: It’s a way of exposing students to a range of analogies—and thus ostensibly helping them develop judgment—much more quickly than is possible in the normal course of life. When situations lack analogies to the past, it’s hard to envision the future. But Knight’s point was that uncertainty is marked by novelty, which, by definition, lacks antecedents. At the very moment when the present least resembles the past, it makes little sense to look back in time for clues about the future. In times of uncertainty, we run up against the limits of experience, so we must look elsewhere for judgment. That’s where strategic foresight comes in. In the United States, strategic foresight can be traced back to the RAND Corporation, a think tank that the U.S. Air Force set up after World War II. Rather than plumbing the mystery of judgment, RAND scholars hoped to replace it with the “rational” tools of quantitative analysis. But as they grappled with the military demands of the postwar world, they could not escape the fact that nuclear weapons had fundamentally changed the nature of warfare. Two countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, had acquired the ability to destroy each other as functioning civilizations. And because no one had ever fought a nuclear war before, no one knew how best to fight (or avoid) one. One RAND analyst, who approached the problem of a potential apocalypse with a glee that made him a model for Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, was a mathematician named Herman Kahn. In the atomic age, Kahn realized, military strategists faced uncertainty to an absolutely unprecedented degree. “Nuclear war is still (and hopefully will remain) so far from our experience,” he wrote, “that it is difficult to reason from, or illustrate arguments by, analogies from history.” How, then, Kahn asked, could military strategists develop the judgment crucial to making decisions about an uncertain future? It was the very question Knight had posed, but unlike Knight, Kahn had an answer: “ersatz experience.” What strategists needed, he suggested, were “strange aids to thought,” in the form of multiple imagined futures that could be developed through simulations such as war games and scenarios. Marc Piasecki/Getty Images In 1961, Kahn left RAND to help found the Hudson Institute, where he eventually shared his ideas with Pierre Wack, an executive from Royal Dutch Shell. In the early 1970s Wack famously applied Kahn’s ideas in the business world, by devising scenarios to help Shell prepare for what might take place as the oil-rich nations of the Middle East began to assert themselves on the world stage. When change did come, in the form of the price shocks induced by the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, Shell was able to ride the crisis out much better than its competitors. (In 1985, Wack chronicled Shell’s efforts in two articles for this magazine: “Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead” and “Scenarios: Shooting the Rapids.”) The Shell exercises marked the birth of scenario planning as a strategic tool for business managers. In subsequent years, Wack’s successors at the company refined his method, and scenario planners from Shell went on to become some of the most prominent scholars and practitioners in the field. Nonetheless, few of the organizations that have conducted scenario-planning exercises in recent decades have institutionalized them as part of a broader effort to achieve strategic foresight. One of the rare exceptions is the U.S. Coast Guard, which describes its work with scenario planning as part of a “cycle of strategic renewal.” As such, it offers a model that many organizations can learn from. One might ask how relevant the Coast Guard’s experience is for businesses, but in fact it constitutes what social scientists call a “crucial-case test.” As a military service, the Coast Guard has less organizational flexibility than most private firms, with a mission mandated by statute and a budget determined by Congress. What’s more, for a long time its need to react daily to numerous emerging situations—from ships in distress to drug interdictions—forced it to focus almost exclusively on the short term, leaving it with little bandwidth to formulate strategy for the long term. Nevertheless, in recent years it has managed to leverage scenario planning to its advantage, reorienting the organization in an ongoing way toward the future. And that, in turn, has allowed it to respond and adapt to disruptive changes, such as those that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks. On that tragic morning, hundreds of thousands of people found themselves trapped in Lower Manhattan, desperate to escape the burning chaos that was Ground Zero. While some were able to walk uptown or across bridges, which officials had closed to vehicles, for many the best way off the island was by water. So over the next hours, an impromptu flotilla—of ferries, tugs, private craft, and fire and police boats—took clusters of people away from the wreckage of the World Trade Center and across the water to safety. Although many vessels operated on their own initiative, a significant part of the evacuation was directed by the Coast Guard, which had issued a call for “all available boats” and coordinated the chaotic debarkation with remarkable poise, creativity, and efficiency. The effort reminded many of the storied British evacuation across the English Channel of several hundred thousand troops that Nazi forces had trapped in Dunkirk, on the coast of France. That the Coast Guard rose to the challenge is no surprise. Although it has a broad set of responsibilities, ranging from search-and-rescue to environmental protection to port security, the organization’s motto is Semper paratus, or “Always ready,” and it prides itself on responding to emergencies. As one retired captain told me, “Our whole idea is, when the alarm goes off, to be able to fly into action.” But September 11 ended up being more than a short-term challenge. In its aftermath, the Coast Guard found its mission quickly expanding. Within a day it was tasked with implementing radically heightened port-security measures around the country: Port security had previously accounted for 1% to 2% of its daily operational load, but it soon consumed 50% to 60%. In March 2003 the Coast Guard was integrated into the new Department of Homeland Security, and that same month it was given the job of securing ports and waterways all over Iraq, following the U.S.-led invasion. In subsequent years the service’s budget would double and its ranks would swell. A new future had arrived. The Coast Guard adapted to this future nimbly—and did so in part because in the late 1990s it had conducted a scenario-planning exercise called Project Long View, which was designed to help the organization contend with “a startlingly complex future operating environment characterized by new or unfamiliar security threats.” Its aim, in effect, was to future-proof the Coast Guard. The service ran Long View in 1998 and 1999—and then, in 2003, in response to the shocks of September 11, renamed it Project Evergreen and began running it every four years. Ever since, the organization has relied on Evergreen to help its leaders think and act strategically. When the Coast Guard decided to launch Long View, it enlisted the help of the Futures Strategy Group (FSG), a consultancy specializing in scenario planning. FSG maintains that uncertainty precludes prediction but demands anticipation—and that imaginatively and rigorously exploring plausible futures can facilitate decision-making. Working with FSG, the Coast Guard identified four forces for change that would have a significant impact on its future: the role of the federal government, the strength of the U.S. economy, the seriousness of threats to U.S. society, and the demand for maritime services. By exploring them and looking forward some 20 years, the team came up with 16 possible “far-future worlds” in which the Coast Guard might have to operate. Of those, Coast Guard leaders selected five that were as distinct as possible from one another (while remaining plausible) and represented the range of environments the service might face. FSG then wrote detailed descriptions of those futures and the fictional events that led to them. Each future world was given a name intended to capture its essence. “Taking on Water” described a future in which the U.S. economy struggled amid significant environmental degradation. In “Pax Americana,” a humbled United States had to contend with a world rent by political instability and economic catastrophe. “Planet Enterprise” was dominated by giant transnational corporations. “Pan-American Highway” featured regional trade blocs oriented around the dollar and the euro. And “Balkanized America” presciently warned of a divided world in which “terrorism strikes with frightening frequency, and increasingly close to home.” NurPhoto/Getty Images Using those scenarios, the Coast Guard convened a three-day workshop, which FSG facilitated. Teams of civilians and officers were assigned to different future worlds and charged with devising strategies that would enable the Coast Guard to operate effectively in them. At the end of the workshop the teams compared notes on what they had come up with. Strategies that appeared again and again, across different teams, were deemed “robust.” In their final report the organizers of Long View listed 10 of these strategies, ranging from the creation of a more unified command structure to the development of a more flexible human-resources system to the establishment of “full maritime domain awareness”—which the Coast Guard defines as the “ability to acquire, track, and identify in real time any vessel or aircraft entering America’s maritime domain.” All of these strategies, they argued, would help the Coast Guard carry out its mission, no matter what the future held. Many of the strategies weren’t novel. But Long View allowed participants to think about them in new ways that proved crucial in the post–September 11 world. In effect, Long View allowed the Coast Guard to pressure-test strategies under a range of plausible futures, prioritize the most-promising ones, and socialize them among the leadership—which meant that after the attacks, when the organization found its mission changing dramatically, it was able to respond quickly. Launching Long View and subsequently establishing Evergreen as a continuous process wasn’t easy. It took exceptionally strong leadership—in particular from admirals James Loy and Thad Allen. The program has also faced challenges in implementing ideas; there is a difference between strategic foresight and strategic execution. But once established, the program developed significant momentum, fueled in part by a growing cadre of alumni who saw the value of a dynamic relationship between the present and the future. The Coast Guard had institutionalized imagination. Long View and Evergreen weren’t designed to bring about a wholesale organizational shift from the operational to the strategic or to train the Coast Guard’s attention primarily on the long term. Instead, the goal was to get its personnel thinking about the future in a way that would inform and improve their ability to operate in the present. That was no small challenge. Management scholars have long noted that, in order to survive and thrive over time, organizations need to both exploit existing competencies and explore new ones. They need to be “ambidextrous.” The problem is that those two imperatives compete for resources, demand distinct ways of thinking, and require different organizational structures. Doing one makes it harder to do the other. Ambidexterity requires managers to somehow resolve this paradox. Long View and Evergreen helped the service’s leaders do that. The programs didn’t reduce the organization’s ability to attend to the present. If anything, the opposite occurred. Exploration enabled exploitation. The Coast Guard members I interviewed for my research reported that Long View and Evergreen accomplished this in several ways. At the most explicit level, they identified strategies that the Coast Guard then pursued. Take maritime domain awareness. The scenarios made it clear to Coast Guard leaders that in any plausible future, they would want the ability to identify and track every vessel in U.S. waters. Although this may seem like an obvious need, it’s not a capability that the service had in the 1990s. As one retired admiral explained, “Ships could come in 10 miles off or even three miles off the United States’ coast, and we might not know it.” That was in part because U.S. agencies had no integrated system for gathering and disseminating information.  Even though the Coast Guard didn’t have the organizational and technological infrastructure to establish full maritime domain awareness immediately, Long View built consensus about its value among top leadership, which helped the service implement it more quickly after 9/11. In fact, the Coast Guard captain who had managed Evergreen led the interagency effort to develop the first National Strategy for Maritime Security, which ultimately prompted the creation of the Nationwide Automatic Identification System—a sort of transponder system for ships. The strategies that emerged from the scenario-planning exercises also enabled personnel who participated in them to act with a greater awareness of the service’s future needs. For example, the first iteration of Evergreen stressed the importance of building strategic partnerships at home and abroad. With this in mind, one senior Coast Guard leader prepared for threats that might emerge in the Pacific by developing bilateral relationships with island nations there; sharing information, coordinating patrols, and holding joint exercises with counterparts in China, Russia, Canada, South Korea, and Japan; and finding ways to work more closely with other U.S. agencies, from the FBI to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the most basic level, Long View and Evergreen simply got the service’s people to think more about the future. The master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard Reserve described how Evergreen had changed his thinking, citing a recent conversation with a colleague: “He and I were here in my office this morning, talking about, ‘Twenty-five years from now, what is the Coast Guard Reserve component going to look like?’” Before taking part in Evergreen, he added, “I just wouldn’t understand how to think that way.” Perhaps most interesting, however—and most important in resolving the supposed paradox between exploration and exploitation—is the way that Long View and Evergreen helped participants understand the demands of the past and the future not as competing but as complementary. The exercises changed the very way in which participants thought about time. Humans tend to conceive of time as linear and unidirectional, as moving from past to present to future, with each time frame discrete. We remember yesterday; we experience today; we anticipate tomorrow. But the best scenario planning embraces a decidedly nonlinear conception of time. That’s what Long View and Evergreen did: They took stock of trends in the present, jumped many years into the future, described plausible worlds created by those drivers, worked backward to develop stories about how those worlds had come to pass, and then worked forward again to develop robust strategies. In this model, time circles around on itself, in a constantly evolving feedback cycle between present and future. In a word, it is a loop. Once participants began to view time as a loop, they understood thinking about the future as an essential component of taking action in the present. The scenarios gave them a structure that strengthened their ability to be strategic, despite tremendous uncertainty. It became clear that in making decisions, Coast Guard personnel should learn not only from past experience but also from imagined futures. The prospect of organizing a scenario exercise can intimidate the uninitiated. There are distinct benefits to enlisting one of the individuals, boutique consultancies, or even large firms that specialize in scenarios to provide helpful direction. However, regardless of who runs the process, managers should follow these key guidelines: One of the chief purposes of a scenario exercise is to challenge mental models of how the world works. To create the conditions for success, you’ll need to bring together participants who have significantly different organizational roles, points of view, and personal experiences. You’ll also need people who represent what Kees van der Heijden, one of Wack’s successors at Shell, has described as the three powers necessary for any effective conversation about strategy: the power to perceive, the power to think, and the power to act. The best scenario planning embraces a decidedly nonlinear conception of time. It’s important to explicitly articulate the assumptions in your current strategy and what future you expect will result from its implementation. Think of this scenario as your projected scenario—but recognize that it’s just one of many possible futures, and focus on determining which assumptions it would be helpful to revisit. Rafael Ramirez, who leads the Oxford Scenarios Programme, advises that in doing this you disaggregate transactional actors, which you can influence or control, from environmental forces, which you cannot. How might those forces combine to create different possible futures? This can be the most difficult part of the exercise, particularly for those used to more analytical modes of thinking. Push yourself to imagine what the future will look like in five, 10, or even 20 years—without simply extrapolating from trends in the present. This takes a high degree of creativity and also requires the judgment to distinguish a scenario that, as the Coast Guard puts it, pushes the envelope of plausibility from one that tears it—an inherently subjective task. Good facilitators can both prime the imagination and maintain the guardrails of reality. Scenario planning is most effective when it’s an immersive experience. Creating “artifacts from the future,” such as fictional newspaper articles or even video clips, often helps challenge existing mental models. It’s also a good idea to disconnect participants from the present, so hold workshops off-site and discourage the use of phones at them. Form teams to inhabit each of your far-future worlds, and give them this challenge: What should we be doing now that would enable us to operate better in that particular future? Create an atmosphere in which even junior participants can put forward ideas without hesitation. Once the groups develop strategies for their worlds, bring them together to compare notes. Look for commonalities, single them out, and identify plans and investments that will make sense across a range of futures. This may sound obvious, but it is the place where most companies fall down. Using scenario planning to devise strategies isn’t resource-intensive, but implementing them requires commitment. To couple foresight with action, leaders should set up a formal system in which managers have to explain explicitly how their plans will advance the firm’s new strategies. Realistically, foresight will not drive every initiative, but scenario exercises can still be valuable in several ways. First, they can provide participants with a common language to talk about the future. Second, they can build support for an idea within an organization so that when the need for implementation becomes clear, it can move faster. Finally, they can enable participants to act at the unit level, even if the organization as a whole fails to link the present and future as tightly as it should. In the long run you’ll reap the greatest value from scenario exercises by establishing an iterative cycle—that is, a process that continually orients your organization toward the future while keeping an eye on the present, and vice versa. This ambidexterity will allow you to thrive under the best of conditions—and it’s essential for survival under the worst. Moving in a loop between the present and multiple imagined futures helps you to adjust and update your strategies continually. This last point is critical. As the current pandemic has made clear, needs and assumptions can change quickly and unpredictably. Preparing for the future demands constant reappraisal. Strategic foresight—the capacity to sense, shape, and adapt to what happens—requires iterative exploration, whether through scenario planning or another method. (See “The Future: A Glossary.”) Only by institutionalizing the imaginative process can organizations establish a continual give-and-take between the present and the future. Used dynamically in this way, scenario planning and other tools of strategic foresight allow us to map ever-shifting territory. Managing the uncertainty of the future requires many tools, some of which have similar or even overlapping functions. To cut through the confusion, here’s a brief guide. Backcasting asks participants to work backward in time from a particular future to ascertain what in the present caused its emergence. The practice is most often used to identify a path to a preferred future but can also be used to avoid steps toward a negative future. “Premortems,” for example, aim to identify the causes of a hypothetical future failure. Contingency planning aids decision-making by preparing participants for specific events that are considered possible or even likely. A contingency plan provides a playbook in case of emergency. Crisis simulations and tabletop exercises have participants respond to specific scenarios and then analyze their actions, to help people prepare for real-life situations. They differ from war games in that they involve a specific possible future rather than a range of plausible futures. Forecasting involves making probabilistic predictions about the future and, as such, is a tool that practitioners of strategic foresight tend to avoid. But it, too, has its place in helping strategists manage uncertainty, adding a quantitative angle to the qualitative methods preferred by, say, scenario planners. The best approach is this: Predict what you can; imagine what you cannot; and develop the judgment to know the difference. Horizon scanning asks participants to search for “weak signals” of change in the present with an eye toward monitoring their development and assessing their potential impact. The practice is guided by the idea that the future often first comes into view in places that most of us are not paying attention to, such as specialized scientific journals. Scenario planning uses stories about alternative futures to challenge assumptions and reframe perceptions of the present. The process does not attempt to predict the future but instead aims to explore plausible futures to inform strategy. Trend analysis asks participants to consider the potential influence of patterns of change that are already visible. A popular structured approach is the STEEP framework, which disaggregates patterns of change into five categories: social, technological, economic, environmental, and political. War games ask participants to engage an opponent in simulated conflict, often to explore reactions to novel circumstances. Like scenario planning, war games do not attempt to predict what will happen; rather, they project what could happen, thereby providing insight into decision-making. Despite the name, war games can address far more than just the military aspects of conflict. Of course, strategic foresight also enables us to identify opportunities and amplifies our ability to seize them. Organizations don’t just prepare for the future. They make it. Moments of uncertainty hold great entrepreneurial potential. As Wack once wrote in these pages, “It is precisely in these contexts—not in stable times—that the real opportunities lie to gain competitive advantage through strategy.” It takes strength to stand up against the tyranny of the present and invest in imagination. Strategic foresight makes both possible—and offers leaders a chance for legacy. After all, they will be judged not only by what they do today but by how well they chart a course toward tomorrow.

But regardless of how robust the evidence might be, this moment, unlike any we’ve ever known, opens new options for the future. This group of talented leaders may become the first visible wave of role models for the generations to come, redefining the way we pick leaders in politics and business. In short, tales of strong female leaders succeeding through this crisis could lead to a change in the overarching narrative of what a strong leader looks like. Though only time will tell if this new narrative survives the crisis, it would not just elevate the overall quality of our leaders — it would likely increase our trust in the result of our choices. We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Countries with women in leadership have suffered six times fewer confirmed deaths from Covid-19 than countries with governments led by men. Unsurprisingly, the media has swelled with stories of their pragmatism, prowess — and humanity. Will these positive outcomes influence our collective readiness to elect and promote more women into power? In both business and politics, leaders of the world have spent the past few months facing a real-time leadership test, played out in the full view of an impatient global audience. A huge crisis, unlike anything seen in our lifetimes, renders experience and expertise irrelevant. Leaders today must learn to lockdown and reopen countries while walking the tightrope between balancing the health of their populations with that of their economies. Their evaluations will be as public as their performances. Instantaneous, global, social-media-documented scrutiny puts their every action and every communication in full view. Whatever the future brings, one thing is certain: those in charge will be judged on how they manage this crisis — and nowhere are the stakes higher than in government. Heads of states are reluctant participants in this leadership contest, subjected to daily reviews of virus statistics, with journalists as judges. The best way to evaluate leaders’ performance has always been to look at how their teams and followers are performing, especially compared to others. But the pandemic and its grim count of death tolls introduces entirely new pressures: standardized, data-driven global metrics invite people everywhere to easily compare, at the click of a mouse, the relative effectiveness of their elected officials. In this competition, few comments have received more attention than the stellar performance of female leaders. An avalanche of articles have highlighted the female-led countries managing the crisis better. It is claimed their superior performance reflects well-established gender differences in leadership potential. Numerous pieces have dug into individual strengths, celebrating Angela Merkel’s data-driven trustworthiness, Jacinda Ardern’s empathetic rationality, and Tsai Ing-wen’s quiet resilience. We are aware of the (many) nuances and limitations of the data under debate. Generalizations stoking the “gender wars” are an easy way to attract popular debate and discussion. Many people have (very) strong opinions about whether women are managing the pandemic better, and everyone is entitled to their own opinions — but not to their own data. For those who wish to poke holes at the “women are better leaders” arguments, here’s a menu of legitimate qualifiers. Too Few to Tell (sample size): There are not (yet) enough women running countries to legitimately examine gender effects. Women only govern 18 countries or 545 million people globally. That’s 7% of the world’s population — an achievement, nonetheless statistically insignificant. It Wasn’t Her (conflating factors): Scientific studies show leaders typically account for around 30% of the variability in a group’s (including a nation’s) performance. This is not trivial but suggests a range of things determine outcomes unrelated to the leader. Every nation confronted this crisis with its own mix of advantages and disadvantages (e.g., educational level, income, income inequality, weather conditions, density, general demographic profile, etc.). Incumbents inherited existing contexts with consequences. They were dealt a hand and have limited credit and blame for how it turned out. This is less true when a leader has been in charge for a long time and has influenced the starting conditions. It’s the Culture (or, correlation isn’t causality): Correlations can be caused by other factors. Even if you agree that women-led countries are handling the crisis better, there are (at least) two other elements to consider. First, countries do better because they have women in charge. Second, countries have women in charge because they were already doing better (less sexism, more inclusivity, removal of glass ceilings blocking competent women from reaching the top in the first place). You don’t have to be a math whiz to see that if a country (consciously or unconsciously) rejects 50% of its talent for leadership roles, it ends up with less — and lesser — talent. Only the Best (selection bias): One of the paradoxical consequences of sexism is that it elevates the quality of female leaders. Because women need to work harder to persuade others that they have the leadership talent it takes, they end up being more qualified and more talented when they are selected for leadership roles. As a consequence, our high-performing covid-response countries may simply be enjoying the fruits of their higher standards for women, rather than that women are, in themselves, superior. One could then argue, from a fairness standpoint, we should make it easier for less competent women to get to the top. That’s what a Frenchwoman, Françoise Giroud argued 30 years ago. A better solution for the challenges facing us in 2020 would be to make it harder for incompetent men to become leaders. Regardless of how robust the evidence might be, or how logical and data-driven the arguments, add to the mix a change in receptivity of the zeitgeist. A small number of female leaders have emerged as a benchmark for what competent leadership looks like — and been applauded for it. Could this be the moment, then, to replace our old, obsolete leadership archetypes with more pragmatic and meritocratic models? A crisis is often defined as the time between the old being not-ready-to-die, and the new not-quite-ready-to-move-in. Will our post-covid world say goodbye to our persistent preference for tough, bold, and reckless leaders, primarily male and obsessed with themselves? Will we be mature enough to adopt a more balanced perception of leadership talent, one based more on increasing group welfare than on individual showmanship? The roller-coaster ride of gender equality over the past few decades may be depressing to some. But this moment, unlike any we’ve ever known, opens new options for the future — millions of them, in fact. This group of talented leaders may become the first visible wave of role models for the generations to come, redefining the way we pick leaders in politics and business. In short, tales of strong female leaders succeeding through this crisis could lead to a change in the overarching narrative of what a strong leader looks like. Society at large may become less surprised and more accepting of leaders (s)elected on their expertise, intelligence, curiosity, humility, empathy, and integrity. Though only time will tell if this new narrative survives the crisis, we hope it will. It would not just elevate the overall quality of our leaders — it would likely increase our trust in the result of our choices. The world didn’t need a pandemic to realize that people are generally better off when their leaders are smart, honest, and modest. But we are glad to see the public, and especially the media, fall in love with the leaders who display these qualities — daily and publicly — while keeping their nations safe at the same time.

"47",47,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/good-leadership-hinges-on-organizational-intelligence","leadership.txt","The qualities that help managers rise in the organization — emotional intelligence, high IQ, technical competence, and so forth — don’t necessarily make them effective once they’re in a leadership position. For that, they need organizational intelligence (OQ), or the ability to get the organization to do what they want it to do. Those with organizational intelligence have the following competencies: they can effectively communicate the top strategic priorities, foster an organization-wide sense of “how we do things here”, get things done even in the absence of consensus, stage moments of theater, and rebel from the top. It takes a lot to get to the top of an organization: a high IQ, emotional intelligence, technical competence, and a variety of personal characteristics, such as fortitude and resilience. Even with those qualities, many leaders fail at the top job — often because they don’t know how to get the organization to do what they want. What they lack — and what successful leaders embody, down to their marrow — is organizational intelligence. OQ, as we’ll call it, consists of five competencies: sending messages that reinforce strategy, fostering an ethos, using “action strategy,” rebelling from the top, and staging moments of theater. Let’s look at each, drawing on examples from our own experience and that of well-known successful leaders. High-OQ leaders send messages that reinforce the strategy — and minimize other messaging. Strategies are implemented not by CEOs and other top executives but by the many people who choose on a daily basis whether to take actions that support or undermine what top management wants to achieve. One key OQ competency is sending messages that reinforce the strategy. The simpler and clearer, the better; organizational members at all levels suffer from information overload, so leaders need to be selective about what messages to send. As the dean of Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), one of us, George, set the strategic objective of persuading faculty members to publish in practitioner journals like HBR and MIT Sloan Management Review in addition to academic journals. (Academic publishing, he believed, was a necessary but not a sufficient condition for RSM to be recognized as a top business school.) At the start of his tenure, only 1% of the 300 faculty publications a year were in managerial journals, and those were not the top journals. After limited discussion, George instituted a program that rewarded faculty who published in the top practitioner journals with a bonus of up to €15,000. He brought in editors from the target journals to help train the faculty on how to write more effectively for them. To reinforce the message, he sent congratulatory emails when faculty had acceptances in such journals (but not for acceptances in academic publications). This selective messaging was not popular, but it was highly effective. Another strategic objective was better cooperation between faculty and staff. A great opportunity arose when one senior professor complained that the teaching program staffers acted as if the faculty worked for them, rather than the other way around. Instead of issuing an EQ response to mollify the professor, George sent an OQ response: “We all work for RSM.” High-OQ leaders foster an understanding, or ethos, of “who we are.” When leaders move from managing individuals or small groups to leading entire organizations, they need to create a shared understanding of what’s important and what the organization stands for — in other words, an ethos. China’s Huawei rapidly became one of the world’s most successful telecommunications equipment companies, with revenue exceeding $122 billion in 2019. Its success stems in no small part from its ethos, “the wolf spirit of Huawei,” created by founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei at the start. Ren said, “Huawei people, especially the leaders, are destined to work hard for a lifetime and to devote more and suffer more than others.” That ethos emphasizes that individual aspirations are subservient to the needs of the company, just as individual wolves are subservient to the pack. Ren described it as a blend of three qualities: extreme resilience, a willingness to self-sacrifice, and sharp predator instincts. Fostering an ethos requires taking two important steps. The ethos needs to be summarized in an evocative statement pointing to the behaviors desired in the organization’s members. And it needs to be communicated widely. High-OQ leaders use “action strategy” rather than consensus building to pursue strategic goals. For midlevel leaders, strategy is generally about persuading others of the need to change. That approach may not be an option at the top. It often makes sense to adopt a stealth strategy rather than a formally declared one and to bring people along gradually, as it starts to prove itself. (Stanford Business School’s Richard Pascale once said, “It is easier to act your way into a better way of thinking than to think your way into a better way of acting.”) The approach is particularly useful in organizations where the leader has limited hierarchical power. When George started as RSM’s dean, in 2008, he was an outsider and a foreigner. The university had charged him with increasing revenue and strengthening relationships with the business community while maintaining RSM’s high level of academic research. He realized he would not be able to institute rapid change through persuasion, because the national culture emphasized slow, intensive consensus building. And he was on a four-year contract and had limited time. So he emphasized action. He began by abandoning the tradition that the dean chaired all defenses of doctoral dissertations; he made it clear that his priority was engaging with external stakeholders, particularly corporate executives. Academics were reluctant to engage with executives. So George revamped the university’s advisory board meetings. Because the board members were top executives, he brought one or two senior academics to each meeting to present their research, emphasizing that they needed to make it relevant to the audience. And he initiated an annual conference whose panels combined executives and faculty members. Turning to personnel, George replaced the people likely to generate the most opposition and appointed a new, supportive vice dean from among the existing department chairs. He created a new position, director of external relations, and placed that director and the director of marketing on the management committee. To give the new changes time to take effect, he delayed a formal discussion of the new strategy until his third year, by which time both revenue and ranking were higher and attitudes had become more favorable. Action strategy is about making things happen. By taking a set of coordinated actions that add up to a strategic change, a leader can kickstart the process without creating organized opposition. High-OQ leaders rebel from the top. Strong leaders usually have strong views about how things should be done, which can lead them to take on too many fights too early in their careers. You don’t want to be like John DeLorean, who battled nearly everything on his way up in —and then out of — General Motors. Really effective leaders learn early to target only important issues — and ones they have a fair shot of winning. That requires two skills. The first is the ability to accurately estimate the level of conflict a particular course of action will elicit. (This is where EQ can support OQ. ) The second is the maturity to not engage in unimportant issues. In many ways the second skill is the more difficult one to develop; most top managers are competitive, and their natural reaction to a challenge is to take it head-on. Rebelling from the top means taking on the biggest challenges only when you have the most firepower. Terry Leahy steadily worked his way up to become the CEO of UK-based Tesco, one of the world’s largest supermarket companies. Along the way he introduced one important innovation: the Clubcard, the UK’s first supermarket loyalty card, which allowed Tesco to leapfrog Sainsbury’s into the number-one retail spot. As CEO, he introduced Tesco’s distinctive online model, based not on the classic centralized warehouse but on existing stores, where Tesco.com employees picked and packed online orders during off-peak periods. The criticism was scathing, including from McKinsey and other top consulting firms. But by 2003 Sainsbury’s had followed suit — by which time Tesco had a five-year head start and an expanding user base. Leahy succeeded with both dramatic changes in part because he maintained  a modest demeanor throughout. And he left other core aspects of the business, such as steadily improving the retail offer (“Every little helps”), untouched. To rebel from the top, leaders must strike a difficult balance. They need to recognize what aspects of the status quo need to be challenged — and they need the discipline to avoid wasting time rebelling in ways that are not strategic and won’t move the organization forward. High-OQ leaders stage moments of theater that will be told and retold throughout the organization. A good theatrical moment reverberates as stories about (and, more recently, videos of) the event are passed along. Effective moments of theater have three important characteristics. They carry a clear message. They are out of the ordinary and unexpected. And they are generally low-cost and relatively easy to execute. Moments of theater are a potent part of a CEO’s toolkit for communicating and reinforcing an ethos. And care must be taken that they don’t conflict with the desired ethos. In the Qingdao headquarters of the Chinese company Haier stands a display case containing a sledgehammer. It commemorates the long-ago day when CEO Zhang Ruimin pulled 76 refrigerators off the production line. There was nothing much wrong with them — just a few scratches and other minor defects. But Zhang wanted to send the message that even minor defects are unacceptable and that Haier intended to match the quality of any competitor worldwide. So he and his managers smashed the defective appliances. His message resonated throughout the Chinese corporate world; one of the sledgehammers now sits in the National Museum of China. When designers showed the first iPod prototype to Steve Jobs, he said it was too big. They replied that they could not make it smaller. Jobs then dropped the device into an aquarium, and bubbles floated up. He said, “Those are air bubbles. That means there is space in there. Make it smaller.”[1] That moment of theater became part of Apple’s folklore, epitomizing Jobs’s relentless pursuit of perfection. The secret is to take advantage of opportunities to do something symbolic in a surprising, high-impact way that will capture the attention (and, hopefully, the hearts and minds) of the organization’s members. That requires stepping out of the normal flow of organizational life. This is a challenging competency — and a powerful one. How to Develop Your OQ First, embrace bureaucracy rather than rail against it. Use the strengths of your organization to achieve your goals. Like a judo master, you must practice getting the maximum effect from your large organization with a minimum effort on your part: the judicious email, the sharp moment of theater. For the rest, let the organization keep doing what it does well. Second, develop an organizational persona. Do people know what type of leader you are and what to expect when they interact with you? Everyone at GE knew what to expect from “Neutron” Jack Welch. Sheryl Sandberg is well-known for combining social skills and intelligence in a way that allowed her to break up the boy’s club at Facebook. Dong Mingzhu, China’s most successful businesswoman and the head of Gree Electric, has a persona that says, “Where Sister Dong walks, no grass grows” — meaning she is really, really tough. Third, follow the small rules so that you can break the big ones. Vernon Hill was transformationally successful in leading Commerce Bank in the USA and then Metro Bank in the UK. But in both cases he was brought down partly by accusations of inappropriate dealings with insiders, such as getting his banks to buy services from his wife’s architectural firm. In 2019, soon after Metro Bank revealed an accounting error involving the misclassification of more than $1 billion in loans, Hill resigned. With the accounting error, Hill broke a big rule — but we suspect that had he followed the smaller rules around issues like showing favoritism to family members, he would have had a better chance of survival. Executives may want to develop these OQ competencies on the way up the ladder — and they’ll certainly need them if they are to succeed at the most senior levels."

Research shows that how organizations respond to large-scale, diversity-related events that receive significant media attention can either help employees feel psychologically safe or contribute to racial identity threat and mistrust of institutions of authority. The authors offer three missteps to avoid —keeping silent, becoming overly defensive, and overgeneralizing — as well as ways that companies and leaders can take meaningful action. The United States is in crisis. As we write this article, videos of racial violence and racist threats toward Black people in America flood social and news media channels. Public demonstrations against injustice are happening in at least 30 localities. During non-violent protests, other parties have engaged in vandalism and looting, spurring varied and often disproportionate police response. Several cities are burning, while Covid-19 continues to rage throughout the country, hitting minority communities the hardest. In a week that focused on “reopening the economy,” everyone has become keenly aware that there is more than one pandemic affecting U.S. lives and local economies. As the American Psychological Association has declared, “we are living in a racism pandemic” too. World leaders are weighing in. The United Nations has urged action from U.S. authorities. No matter your racial, political, or other identity, these events are almost impossible to escape. In particular, millions of Black people and their allies are hurting. And these issues are not ones that organizations or their leaders — from CEOs at the top of the hierarchy to team managers on the frontline — can ignore. While conventional diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives focus on employee engagement and belonging, today’s challenges reach far beyond marginalization in the workplace. We now see and hear Black people who are suffering from the weight of dehumanizing injustice and the open wound of racism that has been festering for centuries. Black leaders like Robert Sellers, the University of Michigan’s vice provost for equity and inclusion and chief diversity officer, are openly sharing their feelings of exasperation. Blogs like Danielle Cadet’s caution readers that “Your black colleagues may look like they’re okay – chances are they’re not.” Another social media message that has gone viral really struck us: “There are black men and women in Zoom meetings maintaining ‘professionalism,’ biting their tongues, holding back tears and swallowing rage, while we endure attacks from a pandemic and police. Understand and be mindful.” The psychological impact of these public events — and the way it carries over into the workplace — cannot be overstated. Research shows that how organizations respond to large-scale, diversity-related events that receive significant media attention can either help employees feel psychologically safe or contribute to racial identity threat and mistrust of institutions of authority. Without adequate support, minority employees are likely to perceive their environments as more interpersonally and institutionally biased against them. Leaders seeking to create an inclusive environment for everyone must find ways to address these topics. First, we’d like to outline three common missteps to avoid. Keeping silent. For people not directly impacted by these events, the default response is often silence. Many Whites avoid talking about race because they fear being seen as prejudiced, so they adopt strategic colorblindness instead. We know that many managers also think they lack the skills to have difficult conversations around differences. But no one has the perfect words to address atrocities in our society. It is the leader’s responsibility to try, conveying care and concern for all employees but especially targeted groups. As Desmond Tutu once said, “If you are neutral in the situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” You might be tempted to rest on the laurels of your organizations’ diversity statements and active employee resource groups. But that is not enough. The words of Dr. Martin Luther King remind us: “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.” Becoming overly defensive. Another common misstep when approaching uncomfortable conversations about racial injustice is to react defensively, especially when our world views, positions, or advantages are questioned or challenged. Robin DiAngelo’s research on white fragility highlights this phenomenon. For instance, when learning about police brutality against unarmed Black people, one reaction might be to search for evidence about what the victim did to deserve abuse, rather than demonstrating compassion and empathy. Another example is diminishing protesters by focusing on and judging those who engaged in looting instead of discussing the unjust act that drove people to the streets. Leaders must resist such reactions because they do not allow for constructive engagement. Instead, they make members of targeted groups feel even more alienated. Remember that comments on systemic inequalities are not personal attacks. Overgeneralizing. When triggering events occur, there is a tendency to make sweeping generalizations about groups of people involved in the public conflict. Though individuals of the same race, gender or other identity often have shared experiences, there is diversity within groups that should be recognized. Instead of presuming that all members of your in-group or out-group think and feel similarly and talking about what “everybody knows,” how “all of us feel,” and what “none of us would ever do,” leave room for dissenting points of view. When in doubt, ask employees about their individual experiences to honor their uniqueness. Think about how you can allow your employees to discuss what’s happening without putting them on the spot or asking them to speak for everyone in their identity group. Best Buy’s senior leadership team offered one of the first corporate statements acknowledging the death of George Floyd under a white police officer’s knee in Minnesota, the harassment of bird-watcher Christian Cooper by a white woman in New York City, and the death of jogger Ahmaud Arbery at the hands of armed white gunman in Georgia, while also paying service to the fact that the Black experience in America is not monolithic: “We write about these … events … not because most of us know what this fear must be like. We are as a group, by and large, not people of color. We write this not because most of us have known anyone personally in a situation like this. Thankfully, most of us do not. We write this because it could have been any one of our friends or colleagues at Best Buy, or in our personal lives, lying on the ground, struggling to breathe or filming someone as they threatened us.” Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat acknowledged that many employees have experienced racism in their everyday lives in overt and subtle ways. “I want you to know that your colleagues and I will always stand with you,” he said in a memo to employees. “While I can try to empathize with what it must be like to be a black person in America, I haven’t walked in those shoes.” Next, we’d like to provide a framework for meaningful action. Leaders must not only offer physical and psychological safety. They also have the power and platform to lead change. Statements from the top are valuable, but they are just a start. Anyone, at any level of the organization, can take small steps to exercise greater compassion and initiate action that provides needed support and promotes racial justice for Black workers as well as others who are marginalized. Managers have a particularly important role in connecting with their employees on these issues.  Here’s how: Acknowledge. It’s important to acknowledge any harm that your Black and brown coworkers have endured. This means committing to lifelong learning about racism. Seek the facts about racist events, as well as the aggressions and microagressions that your minority coworkers have most likely faced inside and outside of your organization.  We suggest the following steps: In the organizational setting, you have the power to step up. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and the company’s diversity chief Brian Lamb wrote a memo to U.S. employees stating: “This week’s terrible events in Minneapolis, together with too many others occurring around our country, are tragic and heartbreaking. Let us be clear — we are watching, listening and want every single one of you to know we are committed to fighting against racism and discrimination wherever and however it exists.” At Georgetown University, president John DeGioia wrote a heartfelt message to the community acknowledging the harm of a series of racist events: “On too many occasions over the years, there has been cause for me to share reflections with our community, as we grapple with the devastating impact of racism and hatred in our nation.  In August 2014, following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; in December 2015, following the grand jury decision in the killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York; in August 2017, following the march of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.  In these moments, which encompass far from the full extent of experiences of racism and racist violence, I have tried to frame the work in which we must engage within the mission and purpose of the Academy.” Affirm. People are looking for leaders to affirm their right to safety and personhood and help them feel protected. When presidents, governors, mayors and sheriffs aren’t doing so, corporate, university, and non-profit leaders can. This means offering continued opportunities for reaction, reflection, conversation, growth, development, impact, and advancement. Affirmation can start with creating a space for employees to share. For example, when asked, “How are you today?” many people of color respond in a scripted manner, instead of answering honestly. Instead, use more thoughtful prompts and questions. You might say something like this: “I’ve been thinking about the harm of racism in our country, especially considering recent events.” Next, describe your personal reaction and concerns, then make a commitment. “I’d like to help in promoting equity, so here’s one thing I plan to do to help prevent future tragedies like these.” Explain those intentions. Then, offer to engage. “Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to be supportive, even if you just want to talk about what’s happening. I understand if you don’t, and I won’t be offended. But I just want you to know that the door is open, and that I care.” The last line is important. Not everyone will be interested in or comfortable with discussing racism at work, especially if they haven’t built a solid foundation of trust. Act. Think critically about how you can use your power to effect change. Employees value words of understanding and encouragement, but leaders’ and organizations’ actions have a more lasting impact. We have witnessed some courageous steps, such as Joan Gabel, president of the University of Minnesota, ending contracts with the Minneapolis Police Department after George Floyd’s death. Franklin Templeton Investments fired executive employee Amy Cooper after her interaction with Chris Cooper in Central Park. Georgetown president John DeGioia’s statement went on to say: “Our role in society — to pursue the truth — through the methodologies and disciplines through which we establish knowledge in our world, demands our engagement.  In our response, we have sought to accelerate our academic commitment to addressing racial justice and to address our own connection to the institution of slavery and the enduring legacy of racism and to undo the structural elements that sustain this legacy.” More examples include YouTube pledging $1 million to the Center for Policing Equity, Glossier giving $500,000 to support racial justice organizations and another $500,000 to Black-owned beauty brands, and Peloton not only donating $500,000 to the NAACP but also calling for its members to speak up for and learn ways to practice anti-racism. What can you and your organization do in your community? What would promote equity and justice and activate meaningful change?  Whether you are a senior or junior leader, how can you advocate for such action? Racism isn’t just Black people’s problem; it’s everyone’s problem because it erodes the fabric of society. Leaders at every level must use their power, platforms, and resources to help employees and communities overcome these challenges and build a better world for us all.

"49",49,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/is-your-company-actually-fighting-racism-or-just-talking-about-it","leadership.txt","At many companies, there is a disconnect between public statements or commitments to fight racism and the daily employee experience. To adequately respond to the current uprisings, leaders must reckon with the Black experience inside their workplaces. Acknowledge that whether intended or not, Black employees have experienced harm in the form of discrimination and racism. Be specific about the actions you’ll take to remedy that harm. Encourage managers to deal with the discomfort of talking about and addressing these issues. And hold your organization accountable. Articulate how progress will be tracked and communicated back company-wide. This is a time for leaders to reflect deeply on how the racism that they are standing up against is replicated or facilitated inside their walls. The wave of uprisings across the nation have made it clear that police brutality disproportionately impacting Black Americans is out of hand. Many businesses have sought to distance themselves from such violence with statements and pledges. But the same racialized violence that many are waking up to as unfair, unjust, and unacceptable, is happening within the walls of our businesses. The key difference between “police brutality” and “corporate brutality” is the means. The former is relatively, although not exclusively, more physical. The latter is more systemic and covert. But in either case the result is the same: People are injured, abused, damaged, and/or destroyed. To adequately respond to the current uprisings, leaders must reckon with the Black experience inside their workplaces. We have spent the past week listening to Black employees within several different companies. A common theme that emerged from these conversations was the disconnect between a company’s statement or commitment of resources externally and the daily employee experience. This disconnect is not new, but the awareness of its depth is novel for some. Several companies have publicly acknowledged this disconnect. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc, stated, “As a firm committed to racial equality, we must also consider where racial disparity exists in our own organizations and not tolerate our shortcomings.” Jason Kilar, the CEO of WarnerMedia, explicitly named racism as a problem in the company and committed to work towards change. The current moment has the potential to be pivotal in addressing the disparity if corporate leaders have the wherewithal to identify the harm being done to Black employees and employees of color, to name company- and industry-specific actions they will take to remedy the harm, and to hold themselves accountable. Defensiveness is a common reaction when waking up to the realities that racism is operating on your watch. You might feel personally responsible for the harms that are outlined. You might be personally responsible in some cases. But disrupting the harmful patterns will require deep listening and learning, not defensiveness. And it may be that you already have the information you need. One sentiment we consistently heard from Black employees was, “We’ve been here before.” “We’ve had focus group after focus group.” These responses suggest that in some companies identifying the harm is as simple as asking employees of color about their experiences or looking back at data already collected. The hard work for leaders is taking in the data and taking action as a result. Blanket and abstract statements that merely denounce police brutality sound more like a politician trying to get votes than an institution prepared to take action. It tells people what you are against without having to commit to being for anything. Perhaps now more than ever, talk is cheap, and you need to guard against this saying at your company: When all was said and done, there was a lot more said than done! Employees are attuned to the differences between political statements and real commitments. Some notable examples of companies committing to specific action are Uber, which has announced no delivery fees when customers order from Black-owned businesses. Internally, they have tied senior executive pay to measurable progress on diversity goals. Activision has added additional resources and in-game reporting systems to identify and ban racist language in their online gaming environment. These are small steps that companies have made to mitigate harm in a matter of days. Another theme we heard from Black employees was that while top-level executives were making statements, their managers lacked the capacity to translate the message. At times they spoke awkwardly, fumbling over their words or side-stepping the issue completely. The way we are socialized around racism leaves white people unpracticed and uncomfortable talking about, let alone leading initiatives around race and racism. To prevent this discomfort from being an obstacle to change, you might provide professional development opportunities that help managers reflect on and talk about race and racism — and not merely the race of others, but their personal racialized experience. For there to be sustainable change, all leadership, and white leadership, in particular, needs to tolerate their discomfort and push forward. If your organization takes a stand against racism, you must also articulate how progress will be tracked and communicated back company-wide. Otherwise, you look untrustworthy and disingenuous. There’s no need for shame or guilt if your results are not glowing or swift. What has been given years to root will not be unearthed overnight. Dig in and do the work as you would with a new account or a coveted growth opportunity. Consider the work it takes to commit to lifting weights and getting stronger. You would not walk into the gym, lift a heavy weight once, and declare you are strong. You would most likely seek expert guidance, and then you hold yourself accountable to lifting those weights consistently over time before you would expect to see results. You might avoid a workout, but doing so only makes the gains harder to come by in the long-term. Building the capacity to be anti-racist similarly takes commitment over time, involves hard work, and is not always pleasant. However, the results — a stronger company — are worth it. One of the legacies of the Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which protects employees against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, was that it switched the focus from “intention” to “impact.” That is, it exposed and refuted the idea that harm is only realized when one can document intentional hate in the hearts of key organizational agents. Instead, it opened our eyes to the reality that harm is best detected via its impact on people. This impact is caused by racism as a system, a pattern of norms, and policies that inflict corporate violence, not merely individual discriminatory behavior. Institutions who are leading the way at this moment are grappling with the reality that the racism we are collectively calling out has been going on for centuries. They are reflecting on why it took this long for them to take a clear stand. Some are reflecting on how taking a stand before sadly did not keep George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others from being killed. And they are reflecting deeply on how the racism that they are standing up against is replicated or facilitated inside their walls. That work calls for us to listen, to be innovative and specific, and to take action to create lasting change beyond this moment.

He explains how his company has pivoted to find new sources of revenue and how he has become a vocal advocate for the restaurant industry. He also explains how he’s thinking about the re-opening process: “We’ll adapt to the changing attitudes and behaviors of our customers because we have to make them feel comfortable. We have to make them feel safe so that they trust us and come back to the restaurant. In the short term, we’ll do the best we can to keep employees and customers safe. Our challenge in the long term is: how can we make our business as close as possible to what it used to be?”   In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Wolfgang Puck, the celebrity chef, has been facing many of the same challenges that restaurateurs all over the world are dealing with: How do you preserve and even grow your business during a lockdown? And how do you begin to reopen safely? In a conversation on May 11 with Boris Groysberg, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, Puck shared how he is steering his businesses — Wolfgang Puck Fine Dining Group, Wolfgang Puck Catering, and Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, Inc. — through the Covid-19 crisis. (Note: The conversation has been edited.) In what ways have you chosen to pivot to new opportunities? What role does experimentation play in that process? When we shut down the restaurants, we decided to do takeout. At the beginning, we didn’t really know how to do it that well. After three weeks I said, “We are not growing our business.” My question is always: How are we going to grow the business we are in? My idea was to think about takeout more broadly. I said, “Let’s give people an experience.” For example, at my restaurant Chinois on Main in Santa Monica, I said let’s not focus on selling customers one lobster for $65.00. Instead, let’s bring them the adventure of having a meal with us. For $39, they get a Chinese chicken soup with wontons in it, pot stickers with spicy sauce, vegetable spring rolls with dipping sauce, the Chinois chicken salad, the choice of half a lobster or a portion of short ribs with candied ginger sweet potato puree, and finally cookies. Obviously, we didn’t make real money with that. But we started to attract a lot of customers. That, for me, is the most important thing. I love to see a business grow, and we have to figure out how we’re going to grow in every restaurant. We also tried something new at Spago in Beverly Hills. We started with discounts to move the food we already had and then increased the prices to where they’d been. That’s also when we started to sell wine and cocktails. People really seemed to like that. You can get a Negroni all made up; all you have to do is pour it over ice and put an orange peel in it. Then we noticed that on Wednesday and Thursday our pickup business was a little slower. So, we started to make fried chicken. Who would have known that that would become the best seller by far? Some ideas didn’t work out so well. We tried burgers on Thursdays, but there wasn’t as much demand for them. So, we tried, and if you don’t try, you don’t know. Now I’m going to do barbecue. And if barbecue isn’t successful, we’ll make fried fish or something else. We’ll see. We try to adapt and do things in order to get another customer to buy our product. We are trying to use the Covid-19 crisis as an opportunity. Maybe one day we’ll build a ghost kitchen where we’ll just do takeout. We could actually develop a whole new business with that. How have you managed your team through this crisis? What role does your management team play in keeping your businesses successful? The crisis really forced me to decentralize my business more than I ever had. I love working with people who I don’t have to push, who are self-sufficient. I don’t want to have bureaucratic structures in place. Every chef and every manager at my restaurants is responsible for their business. They don’t have to call up a manager if they go to the market and find a fresh ingredient or they find the best meat and ask, “Okay, can we make a change and put that on the menu?” I say, “You just do it. I trust you.” That really gives them a lot of confidence, and they feel liberated and happy because of it. Have you pivoted in other ways beyond your restaurants to find additional sources of revenue? I’m giving home shopping a try and it’s going well. We’ve sold over 11,000 of our air fryers and $360,000 worth of steaks. I do that once every two months. I could do it more often, but we don’t have the inventory. It takes some time to set it up because we basically transform our catering kitchen into a studio. I have my catering chefs and everybody working with me. That’s what made it possible to recently do $2.5 million worth of business on a weekend. We had another amazing opportunity a couple weeks ago — a virtual cooking class. It cost $175.00, and we had 150 people sign up. Again, it sounds expensive, but you get two cocktails, a bottle of Chianti, as well as three courses, and a dessert packed up in a bag. Some components were already assembled by us, and other components were up to the people at home. I showed them on video what to do. People gave feedback like, “Oh, my God. I didn’t know I could make a risotto!” It was an experience for them. As a vocal advocate for the restaurant industry, what steps do you think should be taken to help restaurants survive through this crisis? Because of the pandemic, we had to shut down our restaurants. It was very difficult to know what to do. Two months ago, a couple colleagues and I talked to President Trump on the phone. I told him about the insurance companies who don’t want to pay for business interruption insurance. We are trying to get the government to help. I also told the President that we need a stimulus for the restaurant industry. Let people deduct their business meals just like they used to do. I reiterated that this idea wasn’t just about me. For example, I have 150 employees at Spago. Where do they get their food from? From the farmers. Where do they get their fish from? From the fisherman. How do we get all this food? Somebody has to deliver it. It’s a trickle-down effect. It’s really important because the restaurant business directly and indirectly employees so many people. This kind of stimulus would be an important way to help the restaurant and catering industries get back on their feet. How do you envision the re-opening process at your restaurants? What will be the challenges? In the short run, there will be big changes for customers. Obviously, we’re going to have waiters wearing facemasks. We’re going to have a doorman, so customers don’t have to touch a handle. I think we’re still going to have somebody park cars, but customers may want to park their own cars. We’ll find out. Hopefully, by the wintertime we’ll have a vaccine, and then people will feel more comfortable. Our primary concern is how we’re going to make our employees and customers safe. Another concern as we reopen is how we determine how many people and which people are going to get their jobs back right away. It’s really a tough decision to make. It comes back to how are we going to make our employees and the customers feel safe, so that we actually have a viable business. I cannot hire 100 percent of the employees and do 50 percent of the business, because then the company will go bankrupt in no time. We will have a lot of people still unemployed, or on furlough. For me, the most difficult part is deciding who is going to be working and who is not going to be working. A lot of our people are going to have to wait until business comes all the way back, if it comes all the way back. How many months are they going to be on unemployment? It’s really a very difficult thing. Once we get a vaccine and people feel comfortable, I think we’re finally going to get back to the new normal. Now, are we going to get physically close to one another again? We’ll adapt to the changing attitudes and behaviors of our customers because we have to make them feel comfortable. We have to make them feel safe so that they trust us and come back to the restaurant. In the short term, we’ll do the best we can to keep employees and customers safe. Our challenge in the long term is: how can we make our business as close as possible to what it used to be?

"51",51,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/tame-your-inbox-like-an-er-doctor","leadership.txt","As the Covid-19 crisis has intensified there has been a related parallel surge that poses a real threat to communication in the crisis — an explosion of critical emails. This creates a real risk that important information might get lost, stalled, or fail to reach the right people, and that the sheer volume and density of expanding threads could distract people from their essential work. To address the threat, apply crisis resource management principles familiar to every emergency physician. As the Covid-19 crisis intensified in New York City there was a related parallel surge that posed a real threat to communication in the crisis — an explosion of critical email that at first exceeded our capacity to keep up. There was a real risk that important information would get lost, stalled, or fail to reach the right people, and that the sheer volume and density of expanding threads would distract people from their essential work. To address the threat, we applied crisis resource management (CRM) principles familiar to every emergency physician. CRM, derived from crew resource management — an aviation safety protocol — is a method for managing teamwork during a resuscitation or other medical emergency, with effective communication at its core. As emergency physicians, we are trained to apply CRM principles in balancing the workload in a busy emergency department (ED), prioritizing tasks, ignoring distractions, navigating uncertainty, and relentlessly solving complex problems. The exact choreography of care changes depending on the patient volume and severity, with different tempos for patients arriving via ambulance or from mass-casualty events. We realized that managing the flood of crisis-related email needed to be similarly choreographed. Of course, some argue against using email in general, in favor of more nimble communication modalities such as Slack, BAND, WhatsApp, or team sites. But the reality is that during the Covid-19 crisis communication flooded in through every door, window, inbox, and app it could find. Email in hospitals remains largely the dominant form of digital communication; it can’t be ignored, but it can be tamed. Here’s how we have applied CRM communication principles to effectively manage email communication in during the crisis. A team of experts is not the same as an expert team. Having many leaders in a resuscitation room creates cacophony and makes it difficult for a team to focus and prioritize tasks. During the crisis, many well-intentioned leaders from various pillars of the organization composed daily emails with important but oft redundant updates — and the sheer volume of information made it nearly impossible to absorb during busy clinical shifts and other duties. Early in the response we designated a single person to serve as the department email summarizer who would synthesize this daily deluge into a more digestible and consistent format sent at the same time each day. The subject line, format, and section headings were all standardized to reduce cognitive load and focus limited attention on the rapidly changing protocols for testing, clinical care pathways, personal protective equipment availability, and wellbeing initiatives. Clearly stating the title and roles of people on each email was another important step. Consistently including this information spares people the trouble of decoding who the recipients are and why they’re on the thread and assures that everyone on an expanding team is aware of each other’s roles. For instance, when adding Dr. Romney to the cc line, the sender would include the note “+Dr. Romney, Vice Chair of Quality, as she is overseeing mortality reviews.” Soliciting this information from other senders, though possibly awkward, helps all recipients get on the same page and can help later in dispersing the crowd and keeping the focus on action-oriented teams. For example, when somebody was included solely for situational-awareness purposes, they could later be “moved to the bcc line to spare their inbox,” (language that explains their departure) allowing them to see that the team is moving forward while excluding them from subsequent group messages once their role in decision making is achieved. In the resuscitation bay there is no room for vague requests. “Thin-air” statements or “asking the room” refers to requests that are not directed at an individual, such as “can somebody please get me a scalpel.” In the ED, directly asking a person by name to do a specific task provokes a faster response and is more likely to evoke vital additional information (“we’re out of scalpels!”). Similarly, when you’re sending emails during a crisis, avoid the passive voice, clearly direct requests to specific individuals and provide concrete timelines and instructions on how to report back when the action is complete, to close the loop. Email is commonly abused as a tool for putting work on somebody else’s desk without having to confirm that they can take it on. During a crisis it is essential that the person initiating an email solicit a closed-loop response that the message has been received, that the delegated party can complete the action, and that he or she will reply again when the job is done. The subject line can be used like a step-stool the leader stands on to get more attention during a code. Noting action requests in the subject line with open and closed brackets can help readers to prioritize the message.  For example, “Subject: [Response requested by end of day] re: Status of mask delivery.” Once teams are familiar with a common language they can shift to shorthand (e.g., AR = action requested, or EOD = end of day). In a crisis, people’s reflex is to add recipients to an email thread to assure that everyone is on the same page. This can be important, but for the recipient brought into a conversation midstream, it can be time-consuming to piece together what’s going on. Sometimes, after spending several minutes reading and re-reading a lengthy email, the intent of the message and your role remains a mystery. In the ED, when a new member joins a resuscitation in progress, a standard CRM practice is to give them a recap. For example, “This is a 40-year-old male brought in cardiac arrest following a motor vehicle crash. We are on our third round of epinephrine.” When you’re copied onto a chain, rather than spend time reading long threads to reconstruct the narrative simply ask for clarification: “Sorry, long email sent, can you please clarify why I’m added now and how I can help?” The ultimate team goal during any resuscitation is to rapidly adopt a shared mental model of the situation. This assures that everyone understands each other’s roles, the patient’s status from moment to moment, and what needs to be done. With several people working simultaneously and focusing intensively on one problem (say a sudden heart arrhythmia), “task fixation” can occur causing the team to miss something else that’s also urgent (like a blocked breathing tube). To assure that the team avoids task fixation and maintains broad situational awareness in a resuscitation, emergency team huddles often start with a call for quiet in the room followed by a concise game plan and clear instruction about roles, including hand offs. Crisis emails can adopt a similar strategy. To avoid unnecessary noise in an email, explicitly state who you want to hear from and who you don’t (“please don’t reply unless…”). A communications technique called SBAR (for “situation, background, assessment, and recommendation”) facilitates efficient communication and hand-offs during an acute events, and can be usefully applied to email. As our emergency department responded to the escalating Covid crisis, using this format in emails with other departments helped keep communication concise and focused on outcomes. Comments buried in the body of a message are the equivalent of mumbling during a resuscitation; if you have something important to say, bring it to the top and say it loudly with an SBAR. For example, “Situation: Face mask shortage. Background: Last weekend we ran out of face masks on Saturday. Assessment: We need a strategy to ensure weekend supply chain is maintained. Recommendation: Can we either get extra supply on Friday or have a facilities contact that our administrator on call can escalate directly to this weekend if supply runs short again?” Communication in a crisis relies on team members feeling a sense of psychological safety — that they are free to speak openly without fear of repercussion. In the ED, we expect team members to speak up, especially to prevent a mistakes such as a medication error. But evidence shows that unless team members feel safe speaking openly, even vital information like this is often suppressed. Email can be a particular challenge in this regard; it is notoriously poor at conveying tone and so people may feel even less comfortable speaking up as it can be harder to convey the context and spirit in which a comment is made. Acknowledging this at the outset, especially when speaking frankly in email about a concern or problem, will help to provide context and foster an open exchange. Psychological safety is a fragile construct that requires constant nurturing. Remember that unlike in a trauma room, you can still communicate one-on-one via emails, and some replies may be best done individually if there is any risk of somebody feeling they are being publicly reprimanded or embarrassed through reply-all. Just as in the emergency department, the more this communication script is rehearsed and incorporated into the work culture, the safer members will feel sharing information. As a leader, one way to facilitate this via email is to amplify a recommendation made by a junior team member that hasn’t yet been acknowledged. For example, “Andre asked an important question about staff safety. Myriam, what are your thoughts on this?” *** It is time to resuscitate our inboxes. Though there is still a lot to learn as a community about how to communicate with each other during a crisis, developing more standardized formats for email communication will help to build a culture of productive discourse using this medium. Establishing a single point of information delivery and avoiding use of inbox except for communication and tracking of action items can help us focus critical email resources on addressing the topics that need the most attention. Leverage the skills of CRM like an ED doc to tame your inbox and communicate effectively during a crisis. Marie-Laure S.

"52",52,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/growth-after-trauma","leadership.txt","“At some point we will be able to reflect on the long-term consequences of this terrible time,” the author writes. “Almost certainly [they] will include some good along with the bad.” Negative experiences can bring a recognition of personal strength, the exploration of new possibilities, improved relationships with others, a greater appreciation for life, and spiritual growth. Post-traumatic growth often happens naturally, Tedeschi says, but it can be facilitated in five ways: through education (rethinking ourselves, our world, and our future), emotional regulation (managing our negative emotions and reflecting on successes and possibilities), disclosure (articulating what is happening and its effects), narrative development (shaping the story of a trauma and deriving hope from famous stories of crucible leadership), and service (finding work that benefits others). What good can come of this? In times of stress, crisis, or trauma, people often ask that question. This year we’ve been hit by a pandemic that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, unprecedented unemployment, and a global economic downturn. In the face of such a tragedy—personal and collective—it might appear that the answer is “Nothing.”   However, at some point we will be able to reflect on the long-term consequences of this terrible time and what it has wrought for each of us as individuals and for our organizations, communities, and nations. Almost certainly those outcomes will include some good along with the bad. Over the past 25 years psychologists like me have been studying this phenomenon. We refer to it as posttraumatic growth. We’ve learned that negative experiences can spur positive change, including a recognition of personal strength, the exploration of new possibilities, improved relationships, a greater appreciation for life, and spiritual growth. We see this in people who have endured war, natural disasters, bereavement, job loss and economic stress, serious illnesses and injuries. So despite the misery resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, many of us can expect to develop in beneficial ways in its aftermath. And leaders can help others to do so. Although posttraumatic growth often happens naturally, without psychotherapy or other formal intervention, it can be facilitated in five ways: through education, emotional regulation, disclosure, narrative development, and service. As a researcher and a practicing psychotherapist, I (and my colleagues) have helped hundreds of people emerge stronger from suffering in these ways. You can emerge stronger yourself. And you can serve as what we call an expert companion for others, encouraging introspection and curiosity, actively listening, and offering compassionate feedback. Here are the five ways in more detail: To move through trauma to growth, one must first get educated about what the former is: a disruption of core belief systems. For example, before the pandemic, many of us thought we were safe from the types of diseases that endangered people in the past; that bad things happened in other parts of the world but not ours; and that our social and economic systems were resilient enough to weather all storms. None of that was true. So now we need to figure out what to believe instead. When our assumptions are challenged, it is confusing and frightening and tends to produce anxious, repetitive thinking: Why did this happen? Who’s in control? What should I do now? We are forced to rethink who we are, what kind of people surround us, what world we live in, and what future we will have. It can be extremely painful. But as research shows, it can also usher in change that will be of value. We must begin by learning and understanding that truth. I once counseled a woman who, in her thirties, was disabled by a stroke and initially struggled to cope. But she soon understood that her changed circumstances would require her to reevaluate her identity: “Now I have to figure out what is next in this life I never thought I would be living. Part of me doesn’t want to think I have to do this, but I know I do.” That was the first step in her becoming a person with more compassion for herself who could accept limitations without being limited by them. As we move through the current health and economic crisis, consider how you can reinforce—to yourself and others—the recognition that it may have a positive as well as a negative impact. Remember that you and others in your team and organization can reimagine how you operate and innovate in new circumstances. That may already be evident in the emergency measures taken to keep things going. For example, I know an IT employee of a food service company that laid off most of its workers earlier this year. As one of the few to remain, she was forced to work in functions and areas she’d never touched before, which was a struggle. But she soon realized that unencumbered by the usual bureaucracy and turf battles, she could ferret out inefficiencies and find ways to improve on old procedures. To do any learning, one must be in the right frame of mind. That starts with managing negative emotions such as anxiety, guilt, and anger, which can be done by shifting the kind of thinking that leads to those feelings. Instead of focusing on losses, failures, uncertainties, and worst-case scenarios, try to recall successes, consider best-case possibilities, reflect on your own or your organization’s resources and preparation, and think reasonably about what you—personally and as a group—can do. For the founder of one dining chain, emotional regulation was crucial after his board ousted him from the CEO role. As he wrote in HBR (“Crucible: Losing the Top Job—and Winning It Back,” October 2010), the news came as a complete shock, and he was furious at first. But when his father, also an investor, told him to “get [his] head around being supportive,” he did. Instead of focusing on his anger and the feeling that he’d been betrayed, he started thinking about how he could stay calm and professional and help the business going forward. He eventually returned to lead the company. You can regulate emotions directly by observing them as they are experienced. Physical exercise and meditative practices such as breathing also help. Employ these techniques yourself and share them to help others. Acknowledge that circumstances continue to be both challenging and frightening; then demonstrate poise under that pressure. And encourage more-frequent communication so that people feel less isolated and see their collective emotional strength more clearly. This is the part of the process in which you talk about what has happened and is happening: its effects—both small and broad, short- and long-term, personal and professional, individual and organizational—and what you are struggling with in its wake. Articulating these things helps us to make sense of the trauma and turn debilitating thoughts into more-productive reflections. If you’re helping someone talk about what it’s been like to experience this crisis, asking a lot of questions can seem like an intrusive interrogation spurred by curiosity rather than concern. It’s best to focus on how the impact feels and which of your counterpart’s concerns are most important. Negative experiences can spur a greater appreciation for life. A case study comes from a former client. A talented developer getting established in a new company, he created a program that had great promise. But then his bosses hired someone from the outside to run it, asking my client to report to him. Led by this manager, the program underperformed, and the developer was being blamed, damaging his reputation and career prospects. Finally he went to HR. “I wasn’t sure if this was the right move,” he told me, “but I needed to get some advice.” Talking to the HR representative was cathartic, and he ended up telling her more than he’d planned to, because she asked questions such as “What did it feel like to have this project taken from you and essentially messed up?” She then worked to help him recover from that big professional setback. It is important for you as a colleague and a leader to understand the varying impacts the pandemic and the ensuing market volatility, layoffs, and recession have had and continue to have on the lives of those around you. Start by speaking openly about your own struggles and how you are managing the uncertainty. You can then invite others to tell their stories, and listen attentively as they locate their difficulties and come to terms with how their challenges and losses compare with those of others. The next step is to produce an authentic narrative about the trauma and our lives afterward so that we can accept the chapters already written and imagine crafting the next ones in a meaningful way. Your story—and the stories of people you’re helping—can and should be about a traumatic past that leads to a better future.  Consider a nonprofit executive who had been fired from two previous positions over sexual harassment allegations. One night, as he and his wife were driving on the interstate, they were involved in a horrific crash, plowing into a stopped vehicle that didn’t have its lights on. His wife’s injuries were minor, but he was left comatose for a month and needed a year of rehabilitation to walk and talk again. His new narrative went something like this: “Many would think it was this accident that put my life in jeopardy. But I was already in great danger. I was causing pain to others, ruining my career, and heading for a life without my wife or children. The accident forced me to stop, created time for reflection, and showed me what love really is.” When you’re ready, start to shape the narrative of this year’s trauma for yourself and your organization. How has it caused you to recalibrate your priorities? What new paths or opportunities have emerged from it? Look to famous stories of crucible leadership involving people such as Oprah Winfrey and Nelson Mandela, and companies such as Chrysler and Johnson & Johnson, that have emerged from crisis stronger. They are examples of posttraumatic growth. Study and derive hope from them and remind those connected to you to do the same. People do better in the aftermath of trauma if they find work that benefits others—helping people close to them or their broader community or victims of events similar to the ones they have endured. Two mothers I know who’d each lost a child started a nonprofit to help bereaved families connect with others who understood their grief. Forty years later the organization thrives under the leadership of people who have faced similar losses and want to share the strength they’ve gained. Another great example of service comes from Ken Falke, who was a bomb-disposal specialist in the U.S. Navy for more than 20 years. Having seen the wounds of war firsthand, he wanted to help others recover. He and his wife, Julia, began by visiting hospitalized combat veterans, but they felt that wasn’t enough. So they founded the organization where I now work: the Boulder Crest Institute, which has based its Retreat for Military and Veteran Wellness programs on the posttraumatic growth model. Of course, you don’t need to start a nonprofit or a foundation to be of service. Focusing on how you can help provide relief during the continuing crisis—whether by sewing masks or producing content, stocking shelves or retraining teammates, supporting small businesses or agreeing to a temporary pay cut—can lead to growth. So can simply expressing gratitude and showing compassion and empathy to others. How you and your group turn to service will determine whether you see the pandemic and its fallout as an unmitigated tragedy or as an opportunity to find new and better ways to live and operate. Maybe you can see how to ensure that similar emergencies are handled better in the future. Perhaps you can help those most seriously affected. Look for personal and shared missions that energize you and help you find meaning. Hopefully, through this process, you and your teammates or organization will experience growth in one or more of these areas: People are often surprised by how well they have handled trauma. They are left better equipped to tackle future challenges. That can apply to teams and organizations, too. Groups often come through such trials with a clearer picture of their collective knowledge, skills, resilience, and growth potential. Take, for example, a restaurant owner who opened up his new place this past January. By March social distancing policies meant that his entire plan needed reconfiguring. He thought about laying off his staff, waiting for the pandemic to pass, and starting over. But he surprised himself by instead recommitting to the venture and engaging all his employees—from the kitchen and wait staff to his business team—to see if together they could find a way to proceed. When new realities prevent the resumption of old habits, roles, and strategies, we must adapt and innovate. Leaders must have the courage and enthusiasm to test these new paths and show their people that change is to be embraced rather than feared. The restaurant owner encouraged his group to invent a business that would draw on the resources they had—both personal and material—and allow the enterprise to survive. They began taking inventory of one another’s skills and experiences and rose to the challenge of redesigning their work. These are often born of the need to give and receive support through trying times. Trauma can help forge new relationships and make people more grateful for the ones they already have. Coming through a crisis together is a bonding experience. This happened quickly with the restaurant employees. They began to fully appreciate the value that each one of them brought to the table. People who had hardly known one another three months earlier became closer and began functioning as a tight and flexible team. When confronted with fear and loss, we often become better at noticing what we still have but may have previously overlooked. Leaders can model this by acknowledging that fundamental things about living and working are to be valued. We have a great team. Our customers appreciate the work we do. We’ve kept the business alive for the benefit of all who still work in it. Our organization strives toward a higher purpose. Even something as mundane as remarking that your morning coffee tastes good counts. Trauma can make people more grateful for the relationships they already have. Aware that most others in their industry were losing jobs, everyone at the restaurant agreed to stay on for less pay so that no one would be let go. All felt grateful to still be employed, no matter what role they might play in the revamped business. None seemed to consider any job beneath them. They appreciated having an opportunity to keep doing something worthwhile. This comes from reflection on the “big questions” that are often ignored in the routine of daily life. The challenges to core beliefs that we encounter in trauma often force people to become amateur theologians or philosophers to design a life worth continuing to live. Organizations, too, can be confronted with existential questions: Are we conducting our business ethically? Do we practice the principles we preach? Should we be doing something else with our valuable time and resources? What is our contribution to the betterment of society? What is the primary motive for our ongoing existence? It takes courage and foresight for leaders to open up such issues to scrutiny. The restaurant team decided that the business should be a hybrid: part grocery store, part food prep and takeout or delivery service, and part warehouse and distribution point for donations to the local food pantry. The owner and employees wanted to serve the community and knew they would build goodwill as a by-product. They were positioning themselves for short-term survival and long-term success. Any person, team, or organization can do the same. If you’re thinking this is all too optimistic or naive, you may still be too close to the tragedy of this pandemic. That may also be true of others around you. So be patient as you work through and facilitate the process of posttraumatic growth. Those of us practicing in this field know that timing is crucial. Growth can’t be forced, and it can’t be rushed. However, when you and others are ready, it is worth the effort. Let’s make sure that we derive something positive from this time of struggle. The possibilities for personal and collective growth should not be squandered."

Humor is widely considered essential in personal relationships, but in leaders, it’s seen as an ancillary behavior. Though some leaders use humor instinctively, many more could wield it purposefully. Humor helps build interpersonal trust and high-quality work relationships and influences behaviors and attitudes that matter to leadership effectiveness, including employee performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and creativity. These benefits don’t come without potential costs. The guidelines in this article suggest ways to capture the benefits of humor while avoiding the downside risks. A few years ago, we conducted a  research study in which we asked people to help us create an ad campaign for a travel service called VisitSwitzerland.ch (which we’d made up). We put the participants into small groups and showed them a photo—a Swiss landscape of a lake, a mountain, and the country’s distinctive flag with its white plus sign against a red background—accompanied by the question: “What made you fall in love with Switzerland?” We gave participants three minutes to come up with a memorable answer and then had them share their ideas with their groups.   In each presentation, we had two people (who were working with us) share first, using scripts we’d written for them. The first presenter offered a straightforward statement extolling Switzerland: “The country is beautiful. The scenery is truly breathtaking!” The second presenter alternated his approach. In half the presentations he said, “The mountains are great for skiing and hiking! It’s amazing!” In the other half, he added a pun: “The mountains are great for skiing and hiking, and the flag is a big plus! Seriously, it’s amazing!” Admittedly, that isn’t the world’s funniest joke. But we used it to test a simple question: Can one joke make a meaningful difference in how people are viewed by others? In our study, the answer was unequivocally yes. Participants who heard the second presenter make the joke rated him as more confident and more competent than those who heard his joke-free delivery. The jokey presenter was also more likely to be voted as the leader for subsequent group tasks. That’s not a bad payoff for one barely funny attempt at humor. This finding may not be surprising—many of us intuit that humor matters. Ask your colleagues what characteristics they value in a friend or a romantic partner, and they are likely to tell you (among other things), “a sense of humor,” “someone who makes me laugh,” or “someone who laughs at my jokes.” But ask the same people what traits they value in a leader, and odds are that humor will not top the list. We tend to view humor as an ancillary leadership behavior. In fact, it’s a powerful tool that some people use instinctively but more could wield purposefully. One good laugh—or better still, a workplace culture that encourages levity—facilitates interpersonal communication and builds social cohesion. Analysis of large sets of workplace communications suggests that humor occurs in at least 10% of emails and is slightly more likely to be used by leaders in face-to-face interactions. But these numbers can (and should) be larger. Research by us and others has shown that humor can influence and reinforce status hierarchies in groups, build interpersonal trust and high-quality work relationships, and fundamentally shape the way people perceive one another’s confidence, competence, warmth, and clarity of communication. It also influences critical behaviors and attitudes that matter to leadership effectiveness, including employee job performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, citizenship behaviors, creativity, psychological safety in groups, and desire to interact again in the future. However, jokes that fall flat (they’re not funny, or no one laughs) or are offensive (they’re viewed as inappropriate for the context) can harm professional standing by making a joke teller appear less intelligent and less competent. They can lower status and in extreme cases cost people their jobs. One good laugh—or better still, a workplace that encourages levity—builds cohesion. In this article, we offer guidance on how to use specific types of humor to become a more effective leader—and how to avoid being the cautionary tale at your company’s next HR training seminar. Humor and laughter are intricately tied to status and power. People in lower ranks who wield them well can climb the status hierarchy in their departments and organizations. As we saw in the Swiss advertising study (conducted with our colleague Maurice Schweitzer of the Wharton School), individuals who make funny and appropriate jokes are more likely to be nominated for leadership positions by their peers. In the same research project, we ran an experiment in which we asked people to recall moments when a colleague was funny. We found the link between humor and status to be so powerful that merely prompting individuals to recall a humorous exchange with a coworker shifted their perceptions of the coworker’s status. Humor not only helps individuals ascend to positions of authority but also helps them lead more effectively once they are there. Professors Cecily Cooper (University of Miami), Tony Kong (University of South Florida), and Craig Crossley (University of Central Florida) found that when leaders used humor as an interpersonal tool, their employees were happier, which fostered better communication and resulted in an uptick in citizenship behaviors—voluntary actions that facilitate organizational effectiveness. That is, when leaders used humor, their employees were more likely to go above and beyond the call of duty. Why is humor so powerful? In a study to understand what makes things funny, researchers Caleb Warren (University of Arizona) and Peter McGraw (University of Colorado at Boulder) found that humor most often occurs when something is perceived as a benign violation. They conducted studies in which participants were presented with scenarios depicting someone doing something that was benign (for example, a pole-vaulter successfully completing a jump), a violation (a pole-vaulter failing a jump and getting seriously injured), or both (a pole-vaulter failing a jump but not getting seriously injured). Participants who saw the third kind of scenario (simultaneously a violation and benign) were more likely to laugh than those who saw the scenarios that were either strictly benign or strictly violations. Things strike us as funny, the researchers concluded, when they make us uncomfortable but do so in a way that is acceptable or not overly threatening. Because telling jokes that violate our psychological safety can be seen as risky, it can make people appear more confident and more competent. In one of our studies, we found that regardless of whether a joke was considered successful or inappropriate, participants viewed joke tellers as more confident—because they had the courage to attempt a joke at all. Projecting confidence in this way leads to higher status (provided the audience has no information that suggests a lack of competence). We also found that people who violate expectations and norms in a socially appropriate way are seen as more competent and more intelligent. This finding confirms our feelings about funny conversationalists: We admire and respect their wit, which raises their prestige. But the violating nature of humor is also what makes it risky. Jokes that go too far over the line of appropriateness have the opposite effect—an “eeeek” reaction. Rather than thinking that the joke teller is intelligent and competent, observers think, What an idiot or I can’t believe he just said that. Although tellers of inappropriate jokes are still seen as confident, the low competence signaled by unsuccessful attempts at humor can lead to a loss of status. In fact, our research confirms that failed humor is quite costly for leaders, making them even worse off than serious, humorless leaders who don’t attempt jokes at all. Finding the balance between a benign violation and an extreme violation can be tricky—even professional comedians routinely face criticism for overstepping—and it takes skill to get it right. When we converse with others, we need to balance multiple motives simultaneously. We may aim to exchange information clearly and accurately, make a positive impression on one another, navigate conflict, have fun, and so on. The degree to which each motive is viewed as normative and socially acceptable varies from setting to setting. That’s why context is so important when it comes to humor. It’s probably safer to tell your funny story about the horrible hotel service you experienced abroad to your friends at a dinner party (where the normative motive is enjoyment) than to a border patrol agent as you are reentering the country (where the normative motive is information exchange). A certain joke may work dazzlingly well with one group of people but completely flop with another—or even with the same group in a different context. And although jokes generally function as (well-intended) social glue, they may have the opposite effect if they’re perceived as thinly veiled brags or as insulting to specific people or ideas. Here are ways to capture the benefits of humor while avoiding the contextual risks. This form of humor happens anytime an outsider doesn’t have the background information needed to get the joke. Inside jokes are extremely common—our data suggests that almost everyone has engaged in or witnessed one. But how does insider talk, especially inside jokes, affect the dynamics within a group? In collaboration with Ovul Sezer (University of North Carolina), Maurice Schweitzer, and Michael Norton (Harvard Business School), we conducted a study to understand those effects. We asked people to engage in a brainstorming task on instant messenger. Each participant was teamed up with two of our research assistants posing as fellow participants. In one condition, one researcher sent a message to the team that the participant couldn’t read (it looked like garbled text), and then the other researcher sent a response: “I agree!” This made the participant think that the other two had exchanged information that he or she was not privy to. In the other condition, the second researcher responded to the garbled message with, “Hahaha, that’s hilarious, I agree!” It was a subtle difference—in both conditions, participants were on the outside. Did it matter whether what they missed was funny? Yes. Participants were more likely to believe that their partners thought of themselves as superior in the inside-joke condition than in the inside-information condition, and they reported lower group identification and cohesion when the secret exchange involved a joke. Adam Voorhes/Gallery Stock We’ve all experienced this phenomenon firsthand. Although levity is typically thought of as a behavior that binds people together, it can draw fault lines in a group, making some people feel awkward and excluded. Inside jokes have their place, of course. They can signal closeness or camaraderie, making people feel pleased to be in the loop. This kind of humor can be useful in transactional or nonconsequential situations when it doesn’t matter much if an outsider doesn’t get it. But the research on this kind of humor is clear: When group cohesion is important, tell jokes that everyone can understand. Despite the fact that you’re soooo good at using sarcasm, a little more guidance won’t hurt. Research by Li Huang (INSEAD), Francesca Gino (Harvard), and Adam Galinsky (Columbia) reveals that sarcasm is not just for teenagers trying to irritate their parents; it can be useful for managers and teams as well. In their study, participants either made or received sarcastic comments or made or received sincere ones. Participants in the sarcasm condition were significantly more likely to solve a creativity task assigned later in the experiment than those in the sincere condition. In a subsequent study, participants were asked to merely recall a time when they either said or heard something sarcastic or a time they said or heard something sincere. Once again, creativity on the subsequent task was higher in the sarcasm condition. Why does this happen? Sarcasm involves saying one thing and meaning the opposite, so using and interpreting it requires higher-level abstract thinking (compared with straightforward statements), which boosts creativity. The downside is that sarcasm can produce higher levels of perceived conflict, particularly when trust is low between the expresser and the recipient. And because sarcasm involves saying the opposite of what you mean, there’s a risk of misunderstanding or worse if the recipient does not pick up on the humorous intent and takes a sarcastic comment literally. The lesson: Unleash your sarcastic side to get creative juices flowing—but tone it down with new colleagues, in unfamiliar settings, or when working in teams where strong relationships haven’t yet been built. Until you’ve established trust, it’s best to communicate with respect. During his presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy faced accusations that his wealthy father was attempting to buy the election. At the 1958 Gridiron dinner, Kennedy addressed those accusations by saying, “I just received the following wire from my generous daddy: ‘Dear Jack, don’t buy a single vote more than is necessary. I’ll be damned if I’m going to pay for a landslide.’” Self-deprecating humor can be an effective method of neutralizing negative information about oneself. Research by one of us (Brad) and Maurice Schweitzer found that individuals are seen as warmer and more competent when they disclose negative information about themselves using humor than when they disclose it in a serious manner. When they add humor to a disclosure, counterparts view the negative information as less true and less important. For example, the study found that job candidates who revealed their limited math ability in a humorous manner (“I can add and subtract, but geometry is where I draw the line”) were perceived as better able to do math than those who disclosed the information in a serious manner (“I can add and subtract, but I struggle with geometry”). There are limits to the benefits of self-deprecating humor, however. Among lower-status people it can backfire if the trait or skill in question is an essential area of competence. For instance, a statistician can more safely make self-deprecating jokes about her spelling than about her statistical skills. So when discussing core competences, another form of humor might serve the purpose better. (An exception worth mentioning is when being self-deprecating about a core competence is the only alternative to disclosing the information in a serious way.) You should also avoid using humor to reveal your failures in situations where levity would be seen as inappropriate (such as if you are testifying in court) or when the failure is perceived as so serious that joking about it would be in poor taste. At the 2004 White House Correspondent’s Dinner, for example, President George W. Bush showed a video in which he was searching around the Oval Office and saying, “Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere. Nope, no weapons over there…maybe under here?” The topic was too consequential for jokes, and the video generated harsh criticism. In the second of two debates during the 1984 U.S. presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan, the incumbent, was asked if his age would impede his ability to do the job in a second term. At age 73, Reagan was already the oldest president in American history, and he was perceived as being fatigued during the first debate. The president responded by saying, “I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” The audience, along with Reagan’s opponent, Walter Mondale, erupted in laughter. Mondale later said it was the moment he knew he had lost the election. Few people enjoy being asked difficult questions like the one posed to Reagan. Previous research has revealed a range of ways people can respond: by staying silent, explicitly lying, paltering (saying truthful things to deliberately mislead), or responding with another question. Using humor to dodge a question is another option that can be quite helpful in certain situations. That’s because humor is cognitively distracting, according to research by Madelijn Strick (Utrecht University) and colleagues. Just as a good magician gets the audience to look away from the sleight of hand, a successful joke can turn our attention away from certain information. Successful humor also makes us happy, and we are more likely to trust people when we are in a good mood. And as we have mentioned, funny people are seen as more intelligent and skilled. Part of the reason Reagan’s response was so effective was that his mental ability was under attack. By responding with humor (even with a scripted line he had probably rehearsed), Reagan signaled to the audience that he was still mentally sharp. During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was angered when General George B. McClellan failed to attack General Robert E. Lee in Richmond. Lincoln addressed the issue in a letter to McClellan saying, “If you don’t want to use the army, I should like to borrow it for a while. Yours respectfully, A. Lincoln.” Using humor to deliver negative feedback, as Lincoln did, can make criticism more memorable. Delivering negative feedback can be challenging, so it may be tempting to fall back on a joke to lighten the mood. However, couching criticism in the form of a joke can lessen its impact. Peter McGraw and colleagues ran experiments in which participants reviewed complaints that were made in either a humorous or a serious manner. Although humorous complaints were better received than serious ones, they were also seen as more benign, and people felt less compelled to take action to rectify the problem. Because accompanying criticism with humor softens the feedback, it detracts from getting the point across when the issue is not obvious. If a manager jokes about a subordinate’s slipping performance, the employee may think either that his performance hasn’t been slipping or that the situation isn’t a big deal. If it were, why would she be joking about it? Do you remember the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election? For Donald Trump supporters, it was a happy day; for Hillary Clinton supporters, not so much. We took that opportunity to study how humor might help people cope with negative news. The day after the election, one of us (Alison) and several collaborators asked people who had voted for Clinton to write either something humorous or something meaningful about Trump’s victory. Those who sought humor in the situation felt better about it in the moment—and they still felt better about it when the researchers checked back in with them months later. Humor can be an extremely powerful coping tool, in even the toughest of circumstances. Leadership consultant Linda Henman found that American prisoners of war in Vietnam frequently used it to deal with the tough conditions they experienced. Strick and colleagues conducted studies in which they presented participants with photos of negative scenes (such as a physical assault or a car crash), followed by either a funny stimulus or a positive but not funny stimulus. Participants presented with the funny stimulus reported fewer negative emotions than did participants presented with the nonhumorous one. Why? Again, the cognitively demanding aspect of humor distracts people, leaving them less able to focus on negative information. Other research, however, revealed that the type of humor matters. One study by Andrea Samson (University of Fribourg) and James Gross (Stanford) found that positive, good-natured humor in response to bad news made people feel better, but negative, dark, or mean-spirited jokes made them feel worse. It’s also important to be careful about offending others with jokes when a situation is ongoing or recent (“too soon”). There are no hard-and-fast rules about when it’s safe or appropriate to tell a joke, but these general guidelines can help you use humor successfully at work. Use inside jokes when you’re not worried that individuals who don’t get the joke will feel ostracized.Avoid inside jokes when you care about group cohesion and not everyone is in the loop. Use sarcasm when you’re trying to boost creativity in a group of people you know well and trust.Avoid sarcasm when you’re trying to build relationships or when you want to avoid interpersonal conflict. Use self-deprecation when you’re joking about a nonessential trait or skill or you have to disclose negative information about your competence and your only other option is to do so in a serious way.Avoid self-deprecation when you’re discussing a core skill for your job or have not yet established widespread trust in your competence. Use humor to dodge difficult questions when you’re confident the audience will view your response as funny and you have a more serious answer if you’re pressed on the question.Avoid humor to dodge difficult questions when you don’t have a sense of the audience and you’re not highly confident the joke will land. Use humor to deliver negative feedback when you want to increase the odds that the recipient will remember the feedback.Don’t use humor to deliver negative feedback when there’s a chance the recipient will underestimate the urgency or importance of the message. Use humor as a coping mechanism when you’re close with the members of a group going through something difficult.Don’t use humor as a coping mechanism when the situation is ongoing or recent (“too soon”) or you risk being perceived as callous. Use humor whenever you can, cognizant of your relationships with the people listening and the norms of different environments. But in general, humor can be tremendously useful in helping people cope not only during or immediately after a negative event but also over the long term. In other studies Samson and Gross conducted with Alana Glassco (Twitter) and Ihno Lee (Uplight), participants who created funny responses to negative stimuli (such as responding to a photo of a man with facial stitches with, “Now he has a great zombie costume for Halloween!”) reported higher positive affect a week later when they were shown the negative pictures again. So the next time you receive bad news at work (slow sales or a botched launch), think about ways to laugh about it (“At least we don’t have to worry about stockouts” or “I’ve been stress eating so much it’s a shame my portfolio isn’t tracking my waistline”), even if you don’t say them out loud. As comedian Stephen Colbert observes, “You can’t laugh and be afraid at the same time—of anything. If you’re laughing, I defy you to be afraid.” Just as you don’t need to be Phil Mickelson to do well at the company golf outing, you don’t need to be Amy Schumer, Ali Wong, or John Mulaney to use humor well in the office. If anything, following the style or content of many professional comedians—who are expected to push the boundaries of appropriateness—would be dangerous in most workplaces. A joke’s success depends on who’s telling it, where and when it is told, and to whom, so everyone should use caution when attempting to retell a comedian’s jokes at work. The good news is that your colleagues are not expecting you to be as edgy (or as funny) as the professionals—or even to tell planned jokes at all. When you think about humor as a tool of leadership, recognize that people can be funny in a variety of ways. For example, witty conversationalists differ from elaborate storytellers, clever emailers, and rollicking presenters. Each of these types of humor requires a different response time, unique delivery pacing, and an understanding of the audience. If you’re uncomfortable making jokes in a large group or during a presentation, stick to using humor in one-on-one conversations. If you tend to be more serious when talking one-on-one, you might try sending funnier emails. Options for incorporating more humor into your work life abound. Humor at work is a delicate dance, and humor research is still in its infancy. Scholars (including us) are gaining data-driven descriptions of how people use various kinds of humor, and of when it works and when it doesn’t. But any rules of thumb for using humor have to include a caveat: Context matters. Conversational dynamics can vary profoundly from culture to culture, person to person, and group to group. These factors are tricky to navigate and make it difficult—even in the moment—to know whether your humor attempt has been successful or not. Many people will laugh politely even if something isn’t funny or is in poor taste, creating an unreliable feedback loop. If you don’t think you can land jokes at work, or you’re too nervous to try, that’s OK. Not everyone is meant to be funny, just as not every attempt at humor will be successful. (Even professional comedians have bits that bomb.) But you can still incorporate levity into your work life by doing something simple: appreciating other people’s humor. Be quick to laugh and smile. Delight in the absurdity of life and in the jokes you hear. A life devoid of humor is not only less joyful—it’s also less productive and less creative, for you and for those around you. Abundant benefits await those who view humor not as an ancillary organizational behavior but as a central path to status and flourishing at work.

But as most discover, effectively wielding power is rarely straightforward. Simply exercising control over others—the traditional concept of power—is often not the best strategy; it may not even be an option. Indeed, the most potent uses of power often involve no direct influence tactics at all. The authors have developed an approach to power that goes beyond exerting control and mobilizes others’ energy and commitment. It focuses on three core dimensions: Situational power rests on the ability to align objectives, the environment, and bases of power. Relational power is about connections and coalitions: They can be a major source of support, advice, information, and resources—but if neglected or ignored, they can loom as potential points of resistance. Dynamic power involves continually adapting influence strategies to changes in organizational and social systems. The degree to which leaders draw on all three dimensions of power determines how effectively they get things done. Simply exercising control over others—the traditional concept of power—is often not the best strategy. When the path ahead or the very need for change is in dispute, when looking to seize an opportunity rather than put out a fire, when working across silos where claims to authority may be ambiguous, leaders should take a different approach. A new model of power focuses on its three core dimensions: situational, relational, and dynamic. The degree to which leaders draw on all three determines how effectively they get things done. Tara, the chief strategy officer of a  software firm, was the newest member of the C-suite. Except for the CEO, the other officers had joined the executive team from the technology side in the course of acquisitions. Tara, the only MBA, had come from the business side and been recommended by the board. She was excited about her mandate: to drive a coherent strategy across the firm’s fragmented divisions.   Several months in, however, Tara had accomplished little. She’d been blocked by her fellow officers at every turn. In frustration, she asked her supporters on the board to back her up with the CEO. She was stunned when they not only declined but said they might have erred in recommending her for the position. What had gone wrong? As most leaders discover sooner or later, effectively wielding power is rarely straightforward. Simply exercising control over others—the traditional concept of power—is often not the best strategy; it may not even be an option. When the path ahead or the very need for change is in dispute, when looking to seize an opportunity rather than put out a fire, when working across silos where claims to authority may be ambiguous and contested, leaders should take a different approach. The most potent uses of power often involve no direct influence tactics at all. On the basis of decades of research and consulting with executives and managers, we have developed an approach to power that goes beyond exerting control and mobilizes others’ energy and commitment. Our model of power focuses on its three core dimensions: situational, relational, and dynamic. The degree to which you draw on all three will determine how effectively you get things done. Leaders often view power as a purely personal quality, derived from their formal roles and titles, accreditations, skills, and experience; from the information they control and the reputation they’ve built; and from their charisma, resilience, and energy. But power also arises from and depends on situational factors such as your objectives, the environment, and bases of power. Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeffer has observed that one of the primary ways leaders limit their own power is by failing to search for and cultivate sources of influence beyond formal authority and personal charisma. We suggest several steps to help you identify and deploy situational sources of power. Begin by considering the nature of your goal. For example, are you advancing structural change or refining an existing process? Are you managing a crisis or championing a new initiative? Then think about how you might engage others’ energy and commitment to achieve that goal. Ask yourself not just why the goal is important to you but also why it might be important to your colleagues, your company, and society. By drilling down into these questions, you can capture the emotions needed to win the hearts and minds of others while accumulating resilience and energy for the work ahead. Power is often most potent when it mobilizes passion—your own and others’—and when personal objectives and the demands of the situation align. Consider Chief, the private network for connecting and supporting executive women. At critical junctures in their careers, founders Carolyn Childers and Lindsay Kaplan had each wished for advice from other female executives only to realize that like many women, they lacked the deep networks men had built. Inspired by the YPO model, which connects young business leaders around the world, they saw an opportunity to link women executives. Leaving high-profile roles at other companies, they called on funders and power brokers inside and outside their personal networks to help realize their vision. Chief’s first “clubhouse” opened its doors in New York in 2019. It was soon fully subscribed, with members paying hefty fees to belong and committing themselves to growing the organization. In pursuing their personal and professional goals, Childers and Kaplan tapped into a need and desire for community among female leaders and crafted an offering that resonated deeply with them. Most people believe in a just world—one in which credit and rewards accrue in accordance with performance. But that conviction can become an obstacle to the effective development and use of power. In fact, MIT professor Emilio Castilla’s research on the so-called meritocracy paradox finds that bias is higher in contexts that focus exclusively on who is most deserving. Situational power, then, starts with the recognition that working harder and smarter often fails to achieve the “earned” outcome. To get results, leaders should instead work with trusted colleagues and stakeholders to assess the lay of the land and identify blind spots. How does your goal fit within the existing landscape? Why hasn’t the problem you’re addressing already been remedied, or the innovation you’re promoting been realized? What obstacles stand in your way? Steven, a rising executive at a century-old insurance company, saw an opportunity to apply a user-centered design approach to drive strategic innovation, but he lacked the status to advance such a major initiative himself. Despite his best efforts, he was unable to get his colleagues on board. As he thought about why he was deadlocked, he realized that they saw design thinking as a fad and didn’t want to commit employees or other resources to it. Yet as he considered the “why” behind his proposal, he recognized that a user-centered approach not only reflected his values but also resonated with the firm’s origin story and mission: taking care of customers in times of need. He realized that reframing his proposal as an articulation of the organization’s core values would yield power he could leverage, especially with his skeptical colleagues. Acting on that insight, he successfully pushed his initiative through. In a study of successful corporate leaders and entrepreneurs, one of us (Kathleen) and colleagues looked at ways in which formal positions and status markers helped leaders advance their goals. One executive described her motivation for going to business school at age 40 this way: “To get in the room with the guys, you need to be able to talk their language and…have the credibility of knowing that you went to one of the best schools and did very well.” Titles and credentials can secure a place at the table—but they are not always sufficient for the effective exercise of power. Another executive in Kathleen’s study was a banker we’ll call Meghan, who, having led several successful IPOs, was hired for a corporate leadership role at a big-box retailer. “The board wanted someone with my skill set, but many in the company reacted violently, like ‘We don’t know you, and we don’t know why you’re here,’” she told us. “I had to work really, really hard to gain authority.” To her surprise, her new colleagues didn’t seem to care about her IPO credentials. “It wasn’t about the deal anymore. I had to put on an apron and work in the store. To gain authority, I had to learn the business from the ground up.” When considering a new position, leaders should think not only about what titles and resources the job confers but also about whether the culture is one in which they can thrive. One newly minted MBA turned down an offer that would have required rotations in multiple cities, choosing instead a small, growing firm based in her hometown, where she understood the values needed for success. That intuitive understanding, she felt, would allow her to cultivate a stronger base of power than would the constant adaptation associated with moving from one unfamiliar city to another. “It was a company with a lot of integrity, and it was headquartered in the city my spouse and I were from,” she recalled. “All the stars were aligned.” Your job title and personal charisma will take you only so far. Your power strategy should be informed by your objectives, the environment, and bases of power. Ask yourself: Beyond your personal attributes and the situational factors in your organization, your power is also enabled and constrained by your interactions with others. The relationships and coalitions you forge can be a major source of support, advice, information, and resources; those you overlook or ignore can loom as potential points of resistance. The COO of an international manufacturing firm we worked with builds and leverages relationships with plant leaders with an unusual frequency and intensity. “The division heads and sales leaders have my cell phone number, and I have theirs. I can call them anytime,” she told us. “They tell me things I need to know, and I tell them things they need to know—things that will help them or are hot buttons for them.” And she is keenly aware of the value of nurturing relationships over time. “I’m working on a project that requires a change in manufacturing and distribution,” she said. “The marketing element of the initiative is huge. Because I worked closely with the marketing team five years ago, anytime I call them, their response is, ‘Yeah, we can do that.’” To cultivate and exercise relational power, take the following steps. Consider who could help you advance your ideas and then map the array of allies, resisters, and others who might affect your efforts. This will help you understand people’s positions and priorities, actual and possible points of resistance, and potential blocking and supporting coalitions. Then ask yourself, What sources of influence can I deploy to engage others? How will I be able to tell whether those efforts are enough? Another executive in Kathleen’s study recounted a time when, as a newly promoted manager, she was working on a potentially transformative idea. The local vice president expressed interest in the idea but felt it would be impossible to forge a partnership with a key outside company. Undeterred, the manager focused on expanding her knowledge of that firm. “I never stopped talking to people,” she recalled. “Before hanging up, I would say, ‘Can you give me the name of someone else to talk to?’ I learned everything I could about the company—where its business was, where it was trying to make inroads, what its needs were.” Within a few months this relationship building yielded a connection to the company’s founder, who agreed to give the idea a trial. It proved so successful that the manager ended up leaving the company to found her own firm, built around the new partnership. Tara, the CSO who was struggling to implement a unified strategy in her software firm, is another case in point. Assessing her company’s relational landscape, she recognized that shared values were established in the divisions and then traveled to the center, not the reverse. As she was considering how to get her plans on track, a divisional general manager left the firm. Seeing the potential benefits to working side by side with other GMs, Tara asked to lead the division during the search for a permanent head while retaining her role as chief strategy officer. This brought her into the fold in a way she could never have achieved solely as CSO, and she gained the other GMs’ buy-in on a strategy that was ultimately backed by her peers in the C-suite. A pediatrician at a large New England hospital learned the value of this approach. “Usually I would develop what I thought was a good idea and then worry about getting others to adopt it,” she says. “But nothing would happen: People resisted, either openly or passively. Finally, I began to take time up front—engaging in empathic inquiry and inviting others to co-create a solution with me—and the results have been incredible. By the time we pitched to secure resources for a radically new process for onboarding doctors and nurses, I already had the buy-in of the other key doctors and the heads of nursing. The hospital couldn’t say no.” One of us (Elizabeth) has found in her work with executives and entrepreneurs that this pitfall—putting ideas first and people second—is common. By taking the opposite tack, leaders may discover that they no longer have to rely solely on personal influence tactics. When assessing their power, Pfeffer says, leaders need to map their dependencies. Who relies on you? On whom do you rely? Who controls the resources in your firm, and why? Your position in the flow of resources may be as important as your formal title; you can accrue power by controlling and creating resources that others need. The fewer substitutes for the resources you command, the more power you have. But there will inevitably be times when you are more dependent on others than they are on you. The goal then is to find ways to create value for them and thus increase their reliance on you. Pat Fili-Krushel, who started as a secretary at ABC Sports and rose to become president of the network, realized at the start that her initial role could limit her unless she developed sponsors who recognized what she brought to the organization. In each new position she found ways to help her bosses succeed. “I was a learning machine,” she says. “Each boss knew I would always get him the information and results he needed.” Fili-Krushel’s bosses quickly came to rely on her, and in return they recommended her for successively bigger roles. As the sociologist Ron Burt has noted, relational power often comes from brokering connections among others—which may require some finesse. While leaders can often extract information and value by keeping people strategically isolated, that approach may undermine trust and commitment. Instead, as Elizabeth discovered in a multiyear ethnography of leaders in the global music industry, a strategic understanding of when and how to bring people together is also needed to develop and implement good ideas. Jesse, a highly successful Nashville producer, carefully choreographs how he brings together various parties—artists, studio musicians, label personnel, and others—at the outset of a project. He makes a point of publicly praising specific people’s expertise and highlighting what each member contributes to the team; this has real implications for the ultimate performance, he finds. Later in the process, strategic separation might be in order. A producer named Sarah uses the structure and technology of the recording studio to keep lead artists and session players from commenting on one another’s performances and possibly inciting counterproductive conflict. “I’ve got the talk-back button—I’m the only one who can use it,” she says. “I let the artist tell me things in between takes, but I never pass along negative comments to the guitarist. And I don’t let the artist know if the musicians think something’s not great.” Because relationships require investment and nurturing, you need to make choices about whom you will interact with, how often, and on what terms. London Business School’s Herminia Ibarra has found that successful professionals need two types of connections: instrumental relationships, which provide professional information, sponsorship, and resources; and supportive relationships, which are built on personal trust and offer socioemotional buttressing along with dependable, high-quality feedback. Balancing the two types is particularly critical in times of uncertainty or stress, such as when you’re in line for a promotion or launching a new venture. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain that balance as you pro​gress in your career and add connections to your network; you will need to make trade-offs between breadth and depth. Heidi Roizen, a venture capitalist known for her extensive network, became much more strategic about how she spent her time and energy as she advanced. She grew more selective about whom she interacted with on a personal level and made sure that new professional ties were with people she genuinely enjoyed. Your ability to exert influence comes in part from your interactions with others—enlisting and mobilizing supporters and identifying and overcoming potential resisters. As you map your relational landscape in pursuit of a particular goal, ask yourself: Many leaders have a static view of power: Once they’ve established their influence, they assume it’s always there for the using. However, our research suggests that to maintain power, leaders must continually adapt to changes in organizational and social systems. Influence strategies that work today may fail tomorrow. Here’s how to keep up. As entrepreneurs and innovators well know, bringing a product or service to market is rarely a linear process. Offerings must be revised to reflect new perspectives, feedback, and changes in technology or competition. The same is true of the exercise of power: At points it is best to defer decisions, reflect on new information or how your efforts fit within a changing context, and revise the path ahead. Other times it is wise to step away and recharge. In such instances it’s important to think creatively about new ways to engage your target. Working with Harvard’s Lakshmi Ramarajan and Simmons’s Deborah Kolb, Kathleen studied how a professional services firm’s diversity and inclusion initiative played out over 20 years. Internal documents from the initiative revealed cycles of analysis and action—the organizational equivalent of pausing and pivoting. During periods of analysis, undertaken when results had stalled, leaders of the initiative would gather information about its challenges and ask outside experts for their interpretation of the situation. That would lead to a new phase of action. The process was continual: Because the organization, the marketplace for talent, and the diversity challenges were dynamic, each set of actions, no matter how successful at the outset, would gradually lose traction as the context evolved, necessitating a new phase of analysis. Pausing and pivoting may also be necessary on an individual level. Although Steven, the rising insurance executive described earlier, succeeded in launching his user-centered design initiative, there was a catch. Instead of appointing him to direct the project, senior leadership hired an outsider. Steven was disappointed, but he remained supportive of the effort as he turned to other tasks. His strategy of pivoting while staying engaged panned out. The new director, who lacked a deep understanding of the firm’s culture, soon departed, and Steven was offered the position. In our research we have found many instances of leaders who were passed over for promotion but pivoted while remaining engaged and visible and were eventually tapped for the desired role. Leaders must continually adapt. Influence strategies that work today may fail tomorrow. As these examples suggest, there is a meaningful distinction between pausing to pivot and avoidance. The first allows you to reconsider and reconstitute your influence attempt; the second, often arising from discomfort or an inability to effectively exercise power, means giving up your opportunity to gain influence. Each new stage in a career, each new assignment, brings a new power landscape and the opportunity to design a new influence approach. Many of the successful leaders we’ve studied engage in formal and informal experimentation, trying different approaches in similar settings and observing others’ approaches. Although you may ultimately set your sights on driving major change, the best way to begin harnessing your power is by “just doing it.” Look for small wins and share your accomplishments. Experiments are also invaluable for overcoming resistance to new ideas, as a midlevel executive at a consumer electronics company realized. He saw a strategic business opportunity: Could the firm capitalize on promising technologies that for one reason or another had not been given a green light for development? He identified several potential partners who were interested in collaborations to that end, but his firm was not equipped to set the arrangements up, and colleagues and senior executives expressed reluctance. So he decided to pilot the development model with one partner and one audio-engineering technology. This gave him evidence he could share about successes, potential pitfalls, and other lessons. With rich details from this experiment, he was able to engage colleagues, address the obstacles—real and imagined—that they had cited, and springboard a corporatewide effort to systematize strategic partnerships. People grow accustomed to the way power is distributed in their organizations, and they are more comfortable lending energy and commitment to those they know. Those dynamics can fuel resistance to new leaders. When that happens, all the lessons we’ve discussed come into play. It can help to examine how others before you have fared. Why was the previous person effective or ineffective? Are your power bases similar or different? Who are the critical brokers in your organization, and how can you establish and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with them? New leaders should understand that it may take time for people to transfer their allegiance. At a transition point in her career, Fili-Krushel, the ABC Sports executive, was seeking a new challenge. Her boss suggested she throw her hat into the ring for VP of business affairs. The executive overseeing that role didn’t know Fili-Krushel and was concerned that she wasn’t up to the job; he told her she didn’t have what it takes to negotiate big deals and proposed a different role. “I told him, ‘I don’t negotiate like you,’” she recalls. “‘There are other ways to negotiate that are more my style. Give me six months, and if you don’t think I’m doing a good job, I’ll move into the other role.’ He agreed, and that was the last I heard of the other role.” As the organizational systems and relationships around you change, you must continually reassess and modify your influence strategies. Ask yourself: The psychologist Herb Kelman identified three kinds of social influence: compliance, identification, and internalization. Power aimed at compliance affects people’s behavior in a given situation at a given time and depends on formal instruments such as policies, practices, and guidelines. Power aimed at identification is more durable and rests not on rules but on belief in the leader, who earns trust by communicating a vision, articulating goals, and tying the vision and goals to followers’ desired outcomes. It stems from leaders’ stories about themselves. Power aimed at internalization stems from stories about the organization. It may involve changing long-held language, norms, cultures, and beliefs. This is one of the most subtle and effective forms of power; people may not even realize they are being influenced. When fostering internalization, symbolism and imagery are key. They can shape the way information and events are understood and acted on, as storytellers from Homer to Steve Jobs well knew. Childers and Kaplan deftly used symbolism and storytelling when creating Chief. They invoked the metaphor of time travel to conjure a world in which C-suites are fully diverse and organizations are truly inclusive. They shared with potential funders and members their vision of an organization that would attract the energy and commitment of powerful women—one far removed from stale networking events replete with “name tags, awkward mingling in a nondescript conference room, and plastic cups of warm wine and picked-over cheese plates,” as they put it. They paid particular attention to symbolic elements of the space in which members would gather: Co-opting the idea of an “old boys club,” they opened their first clubhouse in the vibrant Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca in rooms designed to exude camaraderie and power, with hunter-green walls and classic leather armchairs. Executive women readily internalized Childers and Kaplan’s vision, not only filling membership to capacity but generating a lengthy waiting list to join.  Power is elusive and coveted, enabling and despised. It speaks to the best and the worst of human nature, evoking strong visceral feelings in those who hold it and in those under its sway. The appropriate use of power is one of the most fundamental and contentious questions of the human condition. Leaders can mobilize energy for personal gain or for collective interests; to enhance potential or destroy it. A thoughtful approach to power requires a nuanced analysis of the intended and unintended effects of influence and close attention to the means as well as the ends.

"55",55,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/the-best-managers-balance-analytical-and-emotional-intelligence","leadership.txt","Being an effective manager requires balancing two networks in your brain: the analytic network (AN) and the empathic network (EN). Managers need to understand their employees and their specific challenges and they need to relate to their feelings and emotional state. They need to form and confirm their thoughts about their perspective and they need to be open to hearing and seeing what their employees hear, see, and feel. The authors point to recent research for insight into how the analytic and emphatic networks work in our brains — and how to become more adept at balancing both. Have you ever responded to a colleague or direct report in a way that left them feeling unheard or unappreciated, even though that was not your intention? Perhaps you gave them a prescriptive solution when what they needed was an empathetic ear. Or maybe you emphasized deadlines, task-related commitments, and accountability at a time when what they needed from you was compassion and understanding. As a manager, it is likely that you have experienced this at some point. These types of experiences are even more likely to occur during periods of crisis like the one in which we currently find ourselves. These are extremely challenging times. We are in the midst of a global pandemic with the numbers infected by the coronavirus in the millions and deaths in the hundreds of thousands. Because of the corresponding economic shutdown, many businesses are closing their doors permanently. In the U.S., we are experiencing unemployment levels not seen since the Great Depression. On top of all of this, streets are filled with protesters crying out for justice after yet another unarmed black man, George Floyd, was killed at the hands of the police, seen in its entirety in a shocking nine minute video viewed all over the world. In times like these our employees are struggling. They are stressed. They are afraid. They are worried about their health. They are worried about their ability to provide for themselves and their families. And, on a broader level, they are concerned about the current and future health of the United States and the rest of the world. Truth be told, you are likely feeling some of the same things. Yet, as a manager, you are required to soldier on. Budgets have to be managed, sales targets have to be met, and difficult decisions have to be made to ensure the ongoing viability of your organization. It is of paramount importance to attend to the needs, fears, and concerns of your employees. It is also vital that you solve pressing problems and make critical decisions necessary to sustain the business. The problem is that these two things require us to activate different parts of our brain. And, we can sometimes get stuck in either the network in our brain that enables that task-focused attention needed to solve problems, or in the other network that facilitates reflection, compassion, and social connection. To be most effective in leading and truly helping our employees, however, we need both networks. We need to understand them and their specific challenges and we need to relate to their feelings and emotional state. We need to form and confirm our thoughts about their perspective and we need to be open to hearing and seeing what they hear, see, and feel. Thankfully, we can turn to recent research for insight into how these two networks work in our brains — and how to become more adept at balancing both. Research by our colleague, professor Anthony Jack at Case Western Reserve University, describes two of the major neural networks functioning in our brains as the analytic network (AN), or technically the task-positive network; and the empathic network (EN), also known as the default-mode network. The AN helps us make sense of things and events. We use it when we are solving problems and making decisions. It helps us engage in abstract or analytic thinking, like financial analysis and data analytics. The EN enables us to scan the environment and be open to new ideas and other people. What’s really interesting is that these two networks oppose each other. More specifically, they actually suppress each other. When one is activated, the other is deactivated. Professor Jack calls these two networks opposing poles of reason. Both involve cognitive activity, both involve fast and slow thinking, both involve reason. However, the AN reasoning is more about information and analysis and the EN reasoning is more about people or qualitative observations. As we also discuss in our book, Helping People Change, we need both networks. We further contend that the most effective leaders do indeed use both and they are able to toggle back and forth between them in a fraction of a second. We also believe that the ease with which a person can toggle or cycle back and forth between these networks depends in part on their self-awareness, deliberate practice, and conscious intent. 1. Be aware of your own predilection. What is your “go-to” neural network?Being aware of your dominant neural network, or the one that is most likely to get activated for you across a variety of situations, requires the practice of mindfulness. You need to be fully and consciously aware of momentary experience. Questions you might ask yourself include: 2. Exercise the neural network that isn’t your go-to. There are a variety of ways to exercise your empathic and analytic neural network “muscles.” A useful approach is to spend more time exercising the network that you are less likely to use. It is similar to the benefit of a right-handed basketball player working on dribbling and shooting with their left hand to improve their overall game. To exercise your empathic network: To exercise your analytic network: 3. Practice balancing both. Once you have mastered the ability to be more aware of when you are either operating in the analytic or empathic network at any given time, and you have developed the capacity to activate either network upon demand, you are then ready to practice effectively balancing the two networks. Again, both networks are important. Your objective here is to develop an ability to seamlessly toggle back and forth between the two networks as necessary. Specific things you can do to work on your ability to toggle between the two networks include: The analytic and empathic networks are waging a constant battle in your brain. When one is activated, the other is suppressed. You don’t have to choose sides, however. It is not that one is good and the other is bad. You actually need them both. The key to maximizing your effectiveness as a leader and having more productive relationships is learning to be more aware of which network is activated at any given time and being able to seamlessly toggle back and forth between the two as necessary.

"56",56,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/turn-your-teams-frustration-into-motivation","managing people.txt","Leaders often feel uncomfortable dealing with employees who are reeling from a disappointment. They often want to contain their feelings, worried they will adversely affect the rest of the team. Instead, they should seek to coach the people to uncover the emotions generated by the experience, help them release their inner self-coach and repress their inner self-critic, and then channel their energies to fuel positive actions. Setbacks and adversity are inevitably accompanied by negative emotions. Someone who has lost a big account, been passed over for promotion, or produced poor quarterly results is bound to feel disappointment, frustration, or anger. Most leaders, confronted with an upset team member, view negative emotions as a contagion to contain before it infects the broader team. Or they see them as a problem to be solved quickly so that people can return to normal. But our work with sports coaches and business executives has shown that leaders can learn to help team members channel their negative emotions and turn them into powerful tools for motivating demoralized people and unlocking their potential. The inner dissatisfaction and energy that accompany negative emotions can propel people to higher levels of determination and hard work. When members of your team face disappointment or failure, you can use it to empower or strengthen them. It comes down to knowing how to have productive conversations around negative emotions. Here is how to navigate three key moments in a conversation to channel negative emotions into positive growth: Label the negative emotion and engage. Many leaders either try to rescue people from negative emotions or retreat from them. Neither approach is effective because both simply paper over strong feelings, ignoring the energy seething underneath. Instead, engage disappointed team members. Name the negative emotion and invite them to talk about it. A senior partner I worked with at a Big Five consulting firm was passed over for promotion. He was subsequently shown the anonymous, highly critical feedback from his peers that had led to the decision. He was shocked and hurt. Many people in his circle tried to rescue him from those emotions. They told him he was terrific, that he shouldn’t get down on himself, that he would bounce back in no time. The well-intentioned reassurance had one effect: It ended conversations. “It didn’t help,” he said. “I had nowhere to take the discussion after that other than to murmur some disingenuous thanks.” There is a more effective approach: label the emotion and invite a response. “It sounds like you’re really disappointed,” I offered. After a long pause, he said, “Honestly, I’m not disappointed — I feel betrayed.” Don’t worry about being wrong, as I was. Just take your best guess. When you put a label on someone’s emotion, they will instantly either agree or correct you. They won’t be able to stop themselves. After the executive I was working with corrected me, we both had the information we needed to move forward. He told me how angry he was, but also how hurt. He said he wanted to fight, but also to quit. As he poured out his feelings, he grew visibly energized. The energy under the emotion surfaced. It is that energy that you want to channel in a constructive direction. Feed the self-coach, not the self-critic. Once the emotion has been identified and the raw energy underneath is exposed, remember that it’s just that: raw. At this stage, it could trigger the positive self-coach voice that says things like, “I clearly have a blind spot; I need to invest more time in understanding how I’m perceived by others.” The energy could also spark doubts about one’s abilities and trigger comments like, “people have finally realized I’ve been faking it all this time.” The positive self-coach is helpful; the self-critic is self-destructive. Effective coaches engage people in creating a productive answer to the question, “What is this emotion telling me?” The self-critic answers with a list of character defects: “I’m stupid, lazy, unlikeable.” The self-coach answers with a list of actions: “I need to work harder, think differently, and recruit support because I’m not there yet.” You can amplify the self-coach’s voice in a demoralized colleague and muffle the self-critic by framing negative emotion as a sign of meaning. For example, you could say, “This really matters to you doesn’t it?” or “I can see how important this is to you.” Seeing negative emotion as a sign of passion can help feed productive motivation. You can also trigger the self-coach by sharing your stories to counter the self-critic’s tendency to make unfavorable comparisons. “I’m not creative” is shorthand for “other people are more creative than I am.” As a leader, you can help deflate the self-critic by candidly sharing your own experiences with struggle and growth — key moments where you felt you weren’t good enough and were subsequently able to push forward. Channel energy to action. The energy that underlies negative emotion can be channeled into things we can control or toward highly unproductive ends. One particularly unproductive outlet for teams has been identified by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander, musical director of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, in their book The Art of Possibility. They call this dead end “the conversation of no possibilities.” Instead of taking control, the team talks only about how bad things are. Such conversations can be seductive because they build a sense of connection among participants, but they ultimately lead nowhere. Instead, help paint a clear picture of the gap that exists between a future of action and one of inaction — and use the difference to channel energy into action. Start by asking the person to imagine how he or she will feel if nothing changes. In the case of the partner passed over for promotion, this was: “How will you feel in 90 days if you’ve brooded on this feedback without doing anything?” “Terrible” was the reply. “And how would it feel if you were able to act on it and move on?” “Like a huge weight was lifted off,” he said. And in the that moment he felt the emotional gap between action and inaction and was ready to embrace positive steps forward. Being passed over for a promotion and feeling betrayed by colleagues is a high-stakes example of negative emotions coming into play. But there are many less severe events that can be turned around by this leadership approach. These are the papercuts of life: a client meeting goes poorly, a project fails to receive budget approval, strategic decisions create work and frustration for everyone. In each case, there is benefit to naming the emotion (e.g. “I can tell you’re frustrated after that meeting”) connecting it to meaning (“This project really matters to you doesn’t it?”) and then channeling the released energy to action (“How would you feel if we could get this back on the docket for next quarter’s review? What do you think that would take?”). Negative emotions are painful, but leaders can help turn them into something positive. As the ground-breaking Italian psychiatrist Roberto Assagioli put it in his seminal work Psychosynthesis, “Trying to eliminate pain merely strengthens its hold. It is better to uncover its meaning, include it as an essential part of our purpose, and embrace its potential to serve us.” Dane Jensen is CEO of Third Factor, an inter-disciplinary leadership development firm that operates in sport, business, academia, and government.

Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. Dear Ascend, How do you navigate working for a toxic leader when you can see the direct impact of their behavior on your career? For example, if you work under a leader who is going out of their way to make sure you don’t develop the skills or experience you need to apply for a more senior role; a leader who takes credit for your ideas and hides information; or a leader who is an expert manipulator, uses reverse psychology to make you feel small and is unapologetic (unless they are in public)? In other words, how do you work for a manipulative boss who is constantly gaslighting you? Sincerely,A We asked Mary Abbajay, author of Managing Up: How to Move Up, Win at Work, and Succeed with Any Type of Boss and president of Careerstone Group, LLC, to respond. Dear A, Nobody should suffer at the hands of a toxic boss. Sadly, your situation is far more common than it should be. Despite spending over $60 billion a year globally on leadership development, research shows that nearly 30% of bosses may be mildly or highly toxic. And make no mistake — bosses who manipulate and gaslight are toxic. Gaslighting is a particularly nefarious form of toxicity due to its subtle and insidious nature. While it is easy to spot toxic leaders who scream, bully, and abuse publicly, gaslighting behavior is much more covert. Gaslighters know how to fly under the radar. They are adept at undermining an employee’s self-esteem, confidence, and sense of reality in subtle, sneaky, and hard-to-prove ways. It’s often your word against theirs, which makes going to other leaders or HR difficult. To make matters worse, their manipulative behaviors — while despicable and destructive — often don’t break any specific company policies. It’s nearly impossible to thrive with a boss who actively undermines your accomplishments, diminishes your self-esteem, and blocks your opportunities. In a perfect world, you could just pack up and go. But in this imperfect and economically challenged world, you might not have the financial freedom to leave (unless you already have a new opportunity lined up). Here are some things you can do to survive — until you decide it is time to move on. Make sure it really is gaslighting. Interrogate your experience. Are you sure your boss isn’t merely a jerk? Or a poor communicator? Or just doesn’t like you or your work product? Gaslighters actively seek to manipulate and control others by making the victim question their own reality and self-worth. They lie. They deny things that they said — even in writing. They project their faults onto others, putting them in a constant mode of defense. They sow confusion. They insinuate that you are the incompetent one. In short, they weaken you in order to control you. Their need to control can stem from myriad of pathologies such as incompetence, insecurity, narcissism, jealousy, or just plain pettiness. If you determine it is in fact gaslighting, take the following measures. Document your interactions. Take notes when communicating with your boss and keep a record of your conversations. Try to have witnesses during meetings and use emails or other written documentation to recap conversations and agreements. Copy other team members on emails when appropriate. Be as clear as possible when communicating. Having a real-time record of your interactions will make it harder for your boss to question your sanity and back pedal on agreements. Doing this will also help you identify if you really are being gaslit. Protect your mental health. This is critical. Toxic bosses are emotionally poisonous, so do what you can to create distance between your mental health and their abusive behaviors. Imagine you are wearing a golden protective shield that repels your boss’s arrows whenever you feel targeted. It’s also helpful to externalize their behavior instead of ruminating on their manipulative tactics. View their words and actions as separate from you. This might look like feeling sorry for them, finding them pathetic, or even finding their insecurity ridiculous. While that may not seem “nice,” building up your own psychological health is critical to your wellbeing. Focus on reaffirming your value to yourself by reminding yourself that your boss is the dysfunctional one, not you. Engage in as many life affirming activities you can. Exercise, meditate, journal, and do things that you love that remind you of who you are, and what you value, at your core. Activate your support network. A strong support network is critical when dealing with an emotionally challenging situation. Surround yourself with friends and people who support and encourage you. Have outlets outside work for socializing and reducing stress. You might even consider talking to a coach, therapist, or other trained professional. Minimize direct contact. Do what you can to limit interacting with your boss. Avoid hallway conversations, coffees, or lunches with them that you aren’t required to attend. Invest that extra time maximizing opportunities to connect with others. A great way to neutralize the impact of a boss who blocks your success is to build relationships with different leaders at your organizations. Seek out mentors and actively look to build your network with those people who can champion your skills and talents. Confront or escalate with extreme caution. Toxic bosses don’t take confrontation well. Gaslighting is often associated with narcissistic personality disorder, so confronting them or hoping they will change may be as pointless because narcissists go to extreme lengths to preserve their ego and control over others. A gaslighter may use this confrontation to further punish you. Escalating to upper leadership or HR is difficult since gaslighting behavior is hard to prove. And frankly, chances are that a manipulative boss has covered their tracks with their boss. Before you confront or escalate, become aware of the organization’s reputation in addressing similar employee experiences. There are two ways you can do this. Ask a few trusted colleagues at work if they have any information or experience — even second-hand knowledge would be helpful. Secondly, check out sites where employees leave reviews about their employers. A company with lots of negative reviews around employee treatment probably won’t offer you much support. If you do confront your boss, have a clear game plan for what you want to achieve from that conversation. Be prepared to make effective requests for what you want and need. Inside every complaint is a request — find it and make it. If you are seeking more opportunities, find out specifically what you need to do to be considered. If you need clarification from their mixed messaging, then bring documented examples for them to review and clarify. If you feel information is being withheld from you, make a specific request for the information you need. In short, be specific about the resources and support you need to do your job, explain your rationale, and articulate how this will not only benefit you, but also your boss and the organization. For example, if you are getting mixed messages, you might say, “I want to make sure that I am on the same page as you on project X so that I can deliver great results for you and the team. I’m confused about Y and need some clarification on Z. Could you explain a bit more about that?” Be sure to repeat back what they tell you, thank them, and follow up in an email. Explore opportunities within your organization. There might be ways to escape your toxic boss without having to leave your company. Look into other positions in the company that interest you, meet with colleagues and managers in other departments, think about where your skills might translate, and make a case for your transition. While all of the strategies above will help you cope with a terrible boss, often in these cases, the best strategy is to leave (if you can). So my question back to you is: Why would you try to keep working for a boss who manipulates and gaslights? At the risk of adding stress to an already stressful situation, it’s important you have the information you need to make the most educated choice about how to move forward. Consider these unsettling facts as you ponder your options: Working for a toxic boss can make you sick. Multiple studies show the harmful emotional, psychological, and physical effects of working for a toxic boss. People who work for toxic bosses are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and other life-threatening conditions. Employees in toxic workplaces are more susceptible to chronic stress, depression, obesity, and anxiety, all of which contribute to a lowered immune system and make you more susceptible to developing physical ailments. Employees with toxic managers get sick more often and report higher levels of emotional and physical exhaustion. The longer you stay, the longer it takes to recover. It can take up to 22 months to recover physically and emotionally from a toxic boss. Mental health professionals actually liken this situation to post-traumatic stress disorder and battered spouse syndrome. As with any psychological trauma or stress, the greater and longer the exposure, the longer it takes to recover. The toxicity goes home with you. Whether you realize it or not, your stress and anxiety impact your personal life and relationships. After every talk I give on this subject, my inbox floods with people asking me to help their friend, loved one, sibling, spouse, etc., escape a toxic environment. The people who love you suffer watching you suffer. At some point you may determine that the only way to thrive is to move on. Be ready to accept that quitting could be the best solution. If your horrible boss is not going to change, take the power back. Give yourself permission to save yourself. Line up your next move and get out.

"58",58,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/working-through-the-death-of-a-colleague","managing people.txt","Leadership trainings and company handbooks don’t typically prepare managers for one of the most difficult things they might experience: the unexpected death of a team member. The author, who works in cancer care, recounts the difficult challenges she faced after losing an employee — and friend — and offers advice for managers in the same shoes: 1) Be authentic with your team; 2) Remember that your plan is not everyone’s plan; 3) Communicate your grief clearly; 4) Use the buddy system when it’s time to hire a new colleague; and 5) Find a way to keep the memory alive. It’s been nearly a year since the loss of my staff member, colleague, and friend. Just three months prior to her unexpected passing, I moderated a webinar for my company, titled “Grief and Loss in the Workplace.” We shared coping mechanisms and resources with staff. We reminded them about our company’s employee assistance program and pointed them to external resources available to them for support. But coping with a colleague’s death is not something we’re coached on in leadership trainings or company handbooks. Can you ever be prepared for getting the call telling you your colleague is gone? For sharing the news with your entire staff? For cleaning out their desk, full of handwritten notes and personal reminders of your friend? As our society has entered into a reality of collective grief following a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives so far, it is even more urgent that we understand how to help one another get through loss. In sharing my experience of managing my team through grief, I hope I can help ease the process. If you are a manager or close colleague of the deceased, chances are you will find yourself — as I did — straddling the uncomfortable divide of grieving your friend and managing logistics. I was not prepared for these challenges. But in reflecting on my own experience, I’ve identified a few steps leaders can take to both manage their own emotions and help steer their organization and teams through this difficult and emotional time. Here are the most important lessons I learned in the time following a loss that deeply affected my workplace community and spirit. I work in cancer care. My colleagues and I are caregivers and survivors ourselves, so we understand the impact of death. But until the death of our colleague, my local office had remained shielded from the personal grief of losing someone we work with. We did not think we had to prepare for this type of loss. As a manager, I was the first person in my office to be notified of my staff member’s passing. Once I composed myself  —  literally, I picked myself up off a restaurant floor  —  I called the other managers in my department. We cried together. We planned. We organized a staff meeting first thing in the morning so we could notify everyone at the same time. The next day, with a prepared script from HR in hand, I told my peers that our “office mom” would not be back. But as I watched noses go red and eyes fill up with tears as my staff realized that no one would bring in English Muffins or Entenmann’s treats anymore, I went off script and sobbed through the meeting. My teammate, another manager, held my hand and sobbed with me. Grief is a natural stage of life but our society often wants to rush right through it. That day with my staff, I did the opposite. As managers and leaders, we often feel pressure to remain poised and in control when things fall apart, but sometimes we need to display vulnerability, not composure. Hold a space for your staff to express their emotions freely. By showing them that there is no shame in authentic emotion, you’re giving them a platform to experience their own processes of grieving. I gave my team the space to feel, process, and share stories that day, and I can still see how important that step has been for all of us today. As the manager of the deceased, I am the person that the family still contacts for questions, that HR requires to fill out paperwork, and that IT pesters for equipment. But while I am the point person, I have little control over the actual process. My original plan was to begin clearing her desk out after a month or so. I was going to wait to hear from her family about what they wanted to do with her belongings. I thought it should still look like her space for a while — it didn’t feel right to start removing pieces of her yet. But within days, IT requested the return of her computer. I became overwhelmed with hunting down every piece of equipment she had signed out, when all I wanted to do was lay down and cry. Within a week of the funeral service, my staff’s family members asked to come in and clear her personal items. I planned ahead to have them come in on a quiet day, when not too many people would be in the office. But my plan was not their plan — they were already on the way. They arrived with boxes and bags. They wanted to toss things that I treasured and keep things I had to shred for confidentiality purposes. Prepare your heart for the unexpected. Every person and family handles the grieving process differently. Some families may not want to come in right away, or at all. Some may ask you to ship items of importance. Some may get upset if you touch belongings. There is no right or wrong way to handle these processes, but having open communication with the family and your office leadership is essential. Remembering logistics like keys and files are helpful, but the family may not know where everything is. Be patient with them. They — like you — are doing their best. One day I came home heavy with grief and my spouse asked how my day was. I said, “I spent my day erasing my friend.” In the first month, I tried to ignore the flood of emails from HR, IT, and other departments. I wanted to say: “No, you cannot have the computer she used for years and created birthday cards on. No, you cannot have the headset she wore that scrunched down her curls. No, I will not fill out separation paperwork — because she wasn’t separated.  She was ripped from us, permanently. I lost her. We all lost her. And I didn’t want her to leave.” I felt the company was unknowingly rushing my grief. Remember that humans are (usually) understanding, but they are not mind readers. Communicate with your colleagues if you feel overwhelmed with expectations like these. When I finally explained to IT why I’d been ignoring their requests, the IT representative expressed her own feelings of grief and shared memories of working with our late staff member. During this season of loss, unexpected interactions like these helped me realize that my colleague’s graciousness had touched nearly everyone she interacted with. Her memory would not be erased. In the back of my mind I was aware that, at some point, I would have to hire someone to fill my late colleague’s role. But, how would I ever be able to replace her? Management reminded me that I didn’t need to rush my hiring process. Yet, within a week, the emails began, asking if I was ready to discuss candidates. Luckily, my supervisor has always been understanding and suggested that I bring in a colleague to help me screen candidates. I remember my supervisor asking, “If someone asks you about the current climate or culture in your office, are you prepared to discuss that?” I honestly wasn’t. And if they asked me about the previous person in the role? Again, I was not ready. I was grateful for the support of my team members during the hiring process. Nothing may really prepare you for what to say about your friend who you lost, but having a buddy during the hiring process can give you a boost of energy and support. Finding the balance of what to say and when to disclose information about the deceased is up to you. Once we brought on a new hire, I did not want to scare them off, but I did want to be honest and let them know that they had big shoes to fill. For me, it was important for our new hire to know the legacy they are now a part of. Now, it is time to honor her memory. I do not have all the answers, but my team and I are discussing ways to honor her legacy. We have already fundraised over $4,000 for her favorite charity, in partnership with one of her daughters. As we approach the one year mark of her passing, we are still considering other deserving ways to honor her. Find a way to honor your team member that best reflects the work they did and the work they would have done. Ask your staff how they want to see your team member honored. Those people who were quiet during the earlier stages of grieving may feel drawn to a project like this. My current goal is to help my staff heal and to not rush their grieving, or my own. I want everyone to know that it’s okay to be sad when you pass her desk, or see a meeting invite that still bears her name. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I spent days thinking of how my friend would have handled the frenzy that ensued. Regardless of her high risk, she would have baked my favorite cake and left it on my porch. She would have searched for the last bottles of hand sanitizer for whoever needed them. She would have offered to grocery shop for cancer survivors. It’s alright to linger in the quiet moments when you remember the sound of her voice or laugh. We do not have to feel bad for laughing at stories or pictures of her. As a team, we can keep her legacy alive by caring for the cancer survivors and volunteers who she adored."
"59",59,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/dont-get-blindsided-by-your-blind-spots","managing people.txt","The pandemic, social unrest, and depressed economy are requiring leaders to be especially sensitive to the impact of their words and actions on others. In this article, the authors describe four categories of training programs that leaders or leadership teams can use to help them overcome their blind spots. To help people navigate the profound challenges posed by a global pandemic, a fragile economy, and social unrest, leaders at all levels of organizations in the public and private sectors must be more sensitive than ever to others’ situations and needs. Most breakdowns in workplace interactions are caused not by bad intentions but rather by a lack of leaders’ awareness of the impact of their behaviors on people in their organization, whether it’s a project team, a business unit, or a large corporation. Given these turbulent times, leadership self-awareness is especially important. But many organizations lack a systematic way to think about options for increasing the self-awareness of their leaders. Is it better to hire a coach or to send your full management team to an experiential learning program? In this article, we offer four basic options and help companies pick the optimal approach for a given situation. Why self-awareness is elusive. The human tendency to judge ourselves by our intent — not our impact — makes occupants of influential roles blind to how others perceive their behaviors. Social scientists have long documented how such blind spots can thwart productive conversation. We are stuck “in a box” of self-deception (as the Arbinger Institute puts it) and hard-wired for defensive reasoning (as pioneering organizational-learning researcher Chris Argyris found). Indeed, people naturally view their abilities to be responsible for their successes and external factors to be the cause of their failures. This tendency — known as self-serving bias — protects our egos but inhibits our ability to receive constructive feedback. Exacerbating this problem is the Dunning-Kruger Effect: the tendency of people who lack the ability and knowledge to perform a particular task to overestimate their ability to do it. If this is how we’re wired, does that mean we have to throw up our hands and give up? No. A range of options exist for leaders to develop greater self-awareness. But should one hire a coach or attend an off-site program that fosters self-discovery through team exercises? The answer depends on a weighing of the tradeoffs between discussion-based and experiential approaches and between individual and team-based training. One variable concerns the type of learning experience. Whether targeting an individual leader or a team, experiential learning can be used to instigate powerful personal insights in an emotionally engaging experience that brings self-discovery through surprise. Expecting to perform well on a challenge only to discover that one has missed crucial information that was readily available serves as a wakeup call that gets learners’ attention. But experiential learning can be time-consuming and expensive, because it takes place outside the context of “real work.” In contrast, a discussion-based approach, such as receiving real-time candid feedback from an executive coach — again for either an individual or a team — is simpler and more flexible, although it can be less emotionally engaging. The other major decision is whether an intervention should target a full team or an individual leader. This depends primarily on whether the main goal is to develop the team as a performing unit — such as a leadership or project team — or to help an individual leader. The constraints faced in scheduling a team for leadership development (related to logistics, time, convenience, or cost) may also matter. These two decisions give rise to four options. Each can help new and experienced leaders alike overcome blind spots. Two involve discussion undertaken in the context of actual work, and two are “off-line” sessions designed to provoke insight and self-awareness through novel experiences. Pick the type of learning experience that is appropriate for the situation and the participants. Source: Amy C. Edmondson and Aaron W. Dimmock 1. Participate in a team simulation exercise. Team simulations can range from outdoor ropes courses that give participants a visceral experience of what it feels like to trust each other in a challenging task to indoor multi-round decision-making exercises done in intact teams. For example, Harvard’s Everest Team Decision Making Simulation provides teams with a series of decisions that participants later discover included crucial information that members failed to share. Some exercises requiring team members to work together effectively to deal with life-threatening situations (e.g., the Lost at Sea and NASA’s Survival on the Moon exercises) can help establish constructive discussion, collaboration, and decision-making norms within a new work group or introduce them to the value of synergy. In each case, the goal is to discover in a condensed time frame specific practices to use to help teams function more effectively. Both of us have experienced the power of personal discovery while working with teams to successfully complete a ropes course. Aaron trained with the U.S. Marine Corps and learned how to best stay calm and provide guidance for other team members when they were stressed while being 15 to 20 feet off the ground — despite the safety nets. Amy studied management teams participating in a ropes course that gained profound insight about what it feels like to problem-solve productively during the unfamiliar challenge. As one participant put it, “If we could be like this back at work, we’d be awesome!” 2. Hire a skilled facilitator for your team. Developing an intact leadership team’s capability for effective processing of tough decisions and difficult conversations can leverage the pioneering work of skilled practitioners, who can help a team develop its capabilities while it carries out its work. The consultant’s role is to diagnose counterproductive dynamics and intervene to get participants to address them in real time. Observations may include how frequently individuals propose a new direction or action, agree with and build on others’ ideas, or provide challenge and dissent. Healthy team conversations present a mix of these actions and, if a conversation goes off the rails, pause to observe and comment on the team’s dynamics. This work is intellectually and emotionally demanding but offers powerful results when taken seriously and carried out in the context of engaging in real work. 3. Get a Coach. Surgeon, writer, and public health innovator Atul Gawande’s TED2017 talk “Want to get great at something? Get a coach” sets the tone for this approach. All of us are vulnerable to being stymied in our attempts to make it on our own. Most crucially, we often don’t recognize the roadblocks we’re putting in our own way. And if we do, we don’t know how to remove them. In this HBR article, Francesca Gino shares how Jamie Woolf, one of Pixar’s two main coaches, helps teammates expand their thinking to uncover their own barrier and address it. 4. Attend an interpersonal skills lab. Jim Detert and Bobby Parmar at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business developed the interpersonal skills lab (ISL) to immerse individuals, paired with actors, in realistic difficult decision-making scenarios and then provide objective feedback through video and physiologic data. Here, participants feel uncomfortable and uncertain, by design, as they go through an experience of leading. Detert finds that the ISL engages students — both young and experienced — in a visceral discovery session. Participants report watching their own videos and confronting their own errors directly as moments of profound surprise. As one participant exclaimed, “I watched my video for the first time a few minutes ago.  … In the moment, I felt one way and looking at it now, I realize how wrong I was.” Participants are deliberately stressed and then coached; the speed of discovery and opportunity to experiment with new approaches in real time promotes self-awareness and skill development. By weighing the tradeoffs between discussion-based and experiential programs and between individual and team-based training, managers can choose the optimal approach for themselves or their leadership teams. By shrinking their leaders’ blind spots, companies will increase their ability to thrive in an uncertain, interdependent world. Amy C.

To lead, you must be able to connect, motivate, and inspire a sense of ownership of shared objectives. Heightening your capacity to lead others requires being able to see how you think and act, and how your behavior affects others. Leading well requires a continuous journey of personal development. Yet people in leadership roles often eschew the long and challenging work of deepening self-insight in favor of chasing after management “tools”— preferably the “quick ’n’ easy” kind, such as personality type assessments that reduce employees to a few simplistic behavioral tendencies. Tools can be handy aids to good leadership. But none of them can take the place of fearless introspection, feedback seeking, and committed efforts to behavioral change for greater effectiveness and increased positive impact on others. When you’re an individual contributor, your ability to use your technical expertise to deliver results is paramount. Once you’ve advanced into a leadership role, however, the toolkit that you relied on to deliver individual results rarely equips you to succeed through others. Beware of falling into the logical trap of “if I can do this work well, I should be able to lead a team of people who do this work.” This would be true if leading others were akin to operating a more powerful version of the same machinery you operated previously. But it’s not; machinery doesn’t perform better or worse based on what it thinks about you and how you make it feel, while humans do. Occupying a leadership position is not the same thing as leading. To lead, you must be able to connect, motivate, and inspire a sense of ownership of shared objectives. Heightening your capacity to lead others requires being able to see how you think and act, and how your behavior affects others. Leading well requires a continuous journey of personal development. Yet people in leadership roles often eschew the long and challenging work of deepening self-insight in favor of chasing after management “tools”— preferably the “quick ’n’ easy” kind, such as personality type assessments that reduce employees to a few simplistic behavioral tendencies, or, for example, implicit bias workshops that are used as a band-aid solution for systemic discrimination, or stack ranking systems that purport to identify the best talent by requiring managers to compare employees to each other. Instead of being a short cut to effective leadership, this mechanistic approach is more often a dead end that misdirects leaders’ attention away from the linkage between their own behavior and employee outcomes. As an example, I worked with an organization that had disengaged employees and frustrated managers who wanted to instill greater commitment and accountability in their teams. A few years earlier, the firm had overhauled its performance management system. The centerpiece of the new solution was a system that prompted managers to enter performance goals and ratings for their direct reports, schedule performance review meetings, and complete the annual performance appraisal process within a specified time period. When managers completed performance appraisals on time and the ratings they gave fit the target distribution,  its sponsors claimed that the system had increased precision and accountability in performance management. What the system’s dashboard didn’t show — and its sponsors failed to appreciate — was that implementation had accompanied a downward spiral of employee morale and engagement. Employees reported that their managers didn’t appreciate their value and were uninterested in their development. Many were on the lookout for new opportunities elsewhere. For their part, managers felt that the organization made performance management cumbersome. They were also blind to their own contributions to a workplace climate that weakened commitment and accountability. Tools can be handy aids to good leadership. But none of them can take the place of fearless introspection, feedback seeking, and committed efforts to behavioral change for greater effectiveness and increased positive impact on others. In my work with the organization above, I helped leaders learn that their greatest leverage to improve the commitment and accountability of their employees lay not in tracking their goal completion, but in creating and sustaining a motivating interpersonal environment. While we did use tools such as frameworks and checklists, their function was to help leaders note the quality of their own and their employees’ experience of work and shift it in a more collaborative direction; they weren’t to be used as replacements for this essential work. Leaders learned to recognize how their assumptions shaped their behavior and learned to consciously adopt mindsets and behaviors that produced better leadership outcomes. Instead of hoping in vain for a magic tool to come along to help you manage your team, think of creating practices to increase your leadership proficiency. This involves taking an idea or research finding and translating it into behaviors that you can repeat systematically to create the desired result. You can use the following steps to design a learning practice for any developmental challenge you’d like to take on: Start with a problem you’d like to solve or a future result you’d like to achieve. What outcome would make a meaningful difference for you? As an example, let’s say that you’d like to see your team members become more proactive in identifying and solving problems. Articulate why it’s important to you now. Getting clear on your purpose and motivation increases the creativity and persistence you apply to designing and sustaining your practice. Perhaps you care deeply about being a wise steward of your organization’s human resources and about bringing out the best in your team members. You believe that more fully harnessing each person’s creativity will benefit the company and your team members. You’ve been feeling overloaded and believe that recapturing some of the time you currently spend overseeing team members’ work will help you be more effective. You also want to reduce the frustration you feel at having to generate all the ideas and plans for your team. Seek quality information to base your approach on. You don’t know the best ways to encourage proactive problem solving, so you check in with your coach or mentor or search for some relevant books and articles. If I were coaching you, I might point you toward practical, research-based articles on encouraging proactivity, developing learning agility, and facilitating learning on your team. Identify measures of success. What would increased proactivity in identifying and solving problems look like in practice? How will you know if you’re making progress? Based on your thinking about what you want to achieve and the reading you’ve done, you decide that you’ll keep track of how frequently team members make suggestions, offer additional ideas to help refine a course of action, and take ownership over implementing a decision. You’ll also monitor your own internal state and how you interact with team members, looking for reduced frustration in yourself and greater enthusiasm and ownership from team members. Finally, you’ll seek feedback from your direct reports. Ground yourself with an intention. You commit to learning to support proactive behaviors. You place a sticky note with this intention on your computer where you’ll see it first thing each morning. Whenever you meet with team members, you call this intention to mind so that it functions like a beacon to guide you, keep you on course, and prevent you from sliding back into your habit of jumping in with the answer if no one else comes forward right away. Choose behaviors to implement. From the reading you’ve done and discussions with your coach, you design the following practices: Seek feedback. Tell your team members that you’re working to support their proactive problem solving and that you need their feedback to help you get better at this. Ask them to let you know whenever you do something that either hurts or helps. Let’s say that a few people note that you tend to shoot down others’ suggestions and micromanage when you’re under stress. Based on this feedback, commit to refrain from criticizing ideas and instead ask team members to assess the pros and cons of each idea. Review and celebrate progress. Within a few weeks, you’ll be able to tell that you’ve made progress if team members are engaging more actively in problem solving on a regular basis. You’ll have a newfound appreciation for the creativity of some employees. If you’ve continued to seek feedback and the team has responded, you should now be able to spend more time clarifying desired outcomes with team members and less time overseeing their work, resulting in a net gain of time and energy. You’ll feel more enthusiastic about leading your team and realize that you have more capacity to develop yourself as a leader than you previously appreciated. It’s one thing to want to hold a leadership role; it’s another to want to do the deep work that learning to lead entails. Resisting the developmental journey of leadership is like flying to an exciting locale, but then spending your whole time there in the airport bar. On the other hand, interest in and commitment to continuous learning and development as a leader will keep you fresh and vital. There’s a valley to cross before you reach the peak. And there’s another valley between that peak and the next one. The developmental journey is fascinating and fulfilling if you embrace it. You don’t have to wait to be trained; you can design leadership development practices any time you want. Monique Valcour is an executive coach, keynote speaker, and management professor.

"61",61,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/4-things-to-consider-before-you-start-using-ai-in-personnel-decisions","managing people.txt","Which candidate should we hire? Who should be promoted? How should we choose which people get which shifts? In the hope of making better and fairer decisions about personnel matters such as these, companies have increasingly adopted AI tools only to discover that they may have biases as well. How can we decide whether to keep human managers or go with AI? This article offers four considerations. The initial promise of artificial intelligence as a broad-based tool for solving business problems has given way to something much more limited but still quite useful: algorithms from data science that make predictions better than we have been able to do so far. In contrast to standard statistical models that focus on one or two factors already known to be associated with an outcome like job performance, machine-learning algorithms are agnostic about which variables have worked before or why they work. The more the merrier: It throws them all together and produces one model to predict some outcome like who will be a good hire, giving each applicant a single, easy-to-interpret score as to how likely it is that they will perform well in a job. No doubt because the promise of these algorithms was so great, the recognition of their limitations has also gotten a lot of attention, especially given the fact that if the initial data used to build the model is biased, then the algorithm generated from that data will perpetuate that bias. The best-known examples have been in organizations that discriminated against women in the past where job performance data is also biased, and that means algorithms based on that data will also be biased. So how should employers proceed as they contemplate adopting AI to make personnel decisions? Here are four considerations: 1. The algorithm may be less biased than the existing practices that generate the data in the first place. Let’s not romanticize how poor human judgment is and how disorganized most of our people management practices are now. When we delegate hiring to individual supervisors, for example, it is quite likely that they may each have lots of biases in favor of and against candidates based on attributes that have nothing to do with good performance: Supervisor A may favor candidates who graduated from a particular college because she went there, while Supervisor B may do the reverse because he had a bad experience with some of its graduates. At least algorithms treat everyone with the same attributes equally, albeit not necessarily fairly. 2. We may not have good measures of all of the outcomes we would like to predict, and we may not know how to weight the various factors in making final decisions. For example, what makes for a “good employee”? They have to accomplish their tasks well, they also should get along with colleagues well, fit in with the “culture,” stay with us and not quit, and so forth. Focusing on just one aspect where we have measures will lead to a hiring algorithm that selects on that one aspect, often when it does not relate closely to other aspects, such as a salesperson who is great with customers but miserable with co-workers. Here again, it isn’t clear that what we are doing now is any better: An individual supervisor making a promotion decision may be able in theory to consider all those criteria, but each assessment is loaded with bias, and the way they are weighted is arbitrary. We know from rigorous research that the more hiring managers use their own judgment in these matters, the worse their decisions are. 3. The data that AI uses may raise moral issues. Algorithms that predict turnover, for example, now often rely on data from social media sites, such as Facebook postings. We may decide that it is an invasion of privacy to gather such data about our employees, but not using it comes at the price of models that will predict less well. It may also be the case that an algorithm does a good job overall in predicting something for the average employee but does a poor job for some subset of employees. It might not be surprising, for example, to find that the hiring models that pick new salespeople do not work well at picking engineers. Simply having separate models for each would seem to be the solution. But what if the different groups are men and women or whites and African Americans, as appears to be the case? In those cases, legal constraints prevent us from using different practices and different hiring models for different demographic groups. 4. It is often hard, if not impossible, to explain and justify the criteria behind algorithmic decisions. In most workplaces now, we at least have some accepted criteria for making employment decisions: He got the opportunity because he has been here longer; she was off this weekend because she had that shift last weekend; this is the way we have treated people before. If I don’t get the promotion or the shift I want, I can complain to the person who made the decision. He or she has a chance to explain the criterion and may even help me out next time around if the decision did not seem perfectly fair. When we use algorithms to drive those decisions, we lose the ability to explain to employees how those decisions were made. The algorithm simply pulls together all the available information to construct extremely complicated models that predict past outcomes. It would be highly unlikely if those outcomes corresponded to any principle that we could observe or explain other than to say, “The overall model says this will work best.” The supervisor can’t help explain or address fairness concerns. Especially where such models do not perform much better than what we are already doing, it is worth asking whether the irritation they will cause employees is worth the benefit. The advantage, say, of just letting the most senior employee get first choice in picking his or her schedule is that this criterion is easily understood, it corresponds with at least some accepted notions of fairness, it is simple to apply, and it may have some longer-term benefits, such as increasing the rewards for sticking around. There may be some point where algorithms will be able to factor in issues like this, but we are nowhere close to that now. Algorithmic models are arguably no worse than what we are doing now. But their fairness problems are easier to spot because they happen at scale. The way to solve them is to get more and better measures — data that is not biased. Doing that would help even if we were not using machine-learning algorithms to make personnel decisions."
"62",62,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/talking-about-mental-health-with-your-employees-without-overstepping","managing people.txt","Like many managers, you probably checked in with your employees throughout last spring when the Covid-19 crisis first started. But you need to keep doing it. As the pandemic drags on, there is a rising number of people who are struggling with mental health issues. As a manager, you don’t want to overstep, but you can — and should — open up a conversation with your employees about how they are doing. The author has several suggestions for how to do that, including, talking about health holistically, avoiding making your employees feel like they are “broken,” and actively listening. Of course, it’s not your job to be your employees’ therapist, but it is your role to create an open, inclusive, and safe environment that allows them to bring their whole selves to work. It’s been called a “second pandemic” — the mental health implications of the global health crisis, political unrest, economic uncertainty, rising unemployment, social isolation, remote work, home schooling, and so much more. And while it can feel like the first pandemic has been with us long enough for employees to have accessed the necessary resources and strategies for handling their stress, the fact is, many of us are struggling more, not less. You may have checked in with your employees back in April when the crisis was acute, but you need to keep doing it. Talking about mental health can feel tricky at best and terrifying at worst, however. And it becomes a vicious cycle — the less people talk about it at work (even when they know they and others are struggling), the more the stigma grows. To break this cycle, you have to address the issue proactively, strategically, and thoughtfully. After all, the way we talk to others who are dealing with anxiety (and to ourselves) has a major impact on how we feel. Managers have a responsibility to their employees to create an open, inclusive, and safe environment that allows them to bring their whole selves to work. In her article “We Need to Talk More About Mental Health at Work,” Morra Aarons-Mele shares research showing that “feeling authentic and open at work leads to better performance, engagement, employee retention, and overall wellbeing.” Leaders at all levels need to put mental health “on the table” — to talk about it, invite others to talk about it, and work actively to develop resources and plans for their employees. This is how to reduce mental health stigma while increasing the likelihood that your colleagues feel happier, more confident, and more productive. So how do you start talking about a topic that can make even the bravest leader worry about overstepping? Here are three ways: Chances are that you’d ask your co-worker about the back pain they’ve been experiencing since they started working from home. You’d probably also ask your team member about the tendon they tore on a recent run. You might even share an update about your seasonal allergies or your indigestion. When you’re asking about someone’s health, make a note to ask about their mental health too. It can be as simple as, “It sounds like your back pain is getting better. That’s good news. And how’s your mental health these days? I know these can be very stressful times — and please let me know if I’m overstepping.” (And then stop talking.) It’s helpful if you are willing to share your own struggles, too, because it normalizes the discussion. You might try, “My allergies are keeping me up at night — and so is my anxiety. It’s really hard to get a solid night’s sleep when I’m worried about my kids’ safety at school. How about you? What’s keeping you up at night?” (And then again, stop talking.) It’s important to note that if you haven’t had a close connection with a particular employee in the past, your relationship may be low on psychological safety. To start building that up, take small steps. You might say something like, “I know that you and I haven’t typically talked about non-work topics, but for me, work and non-work feel like they’re blurring together these days. How are you doing with that?” Leaders often succeed by navigating difficult situations and solving complex problems. But people don’t like to be “fixed,” so don’t try. An employee who believes you see them as broken may worry that you don’t see them as capable or credible, which can undermine their confidence and competence. Approach your colleagues with the mindset that they are resourceful, able, and may need your support but not necessarily solutions. You want to be a bridge to resources, rather than being the resource yourself. If someone shares that they are struggling, try saying: Financier Bernard Baruch said, “Most of the successful people I’ve known are the ones who do more listening than talking.” But it’s not enough to just listen; you need to do it well. But that’s not always easy — especially now when our own preoccupations, distractions, biases, and judgements get in the way. If you want to create an environment where your employees feel heard, respected, and cared for, here’s how: As World Health Organization ambassador Liya Kebede said, “Helping others isn’t a chore, it is one of the greatest gifts there is.” Your willingness to open up an honest conversation about mental health with your employees is exactly the kind of gift that so many people want and need right now."
"63",63,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/research-how-virtual-teams-can-better-share-knowledge","managing people.txt","One of the stated reasons for trying to get workers back into the office is the chorus of concern around the difficulties of sharing knowledge and experience amongst remote co-workers. New research, however, suggests a method that could improve this process both in the office and remotely: guided meetings between coworkers, which can easily happen in person or remotely. Compared to monetary incentives (without guidance from management), a combined treatment that combined guided meetings and incentives, and a control group, the guided meetings created a longer, more substantial lift in sales productivity than monetary incentives — and roughly equal results to the combined treatment. Over the 24 weeks that sales data was tracked, the firm being studied realized a 7-figure increase in revenue among those who participated in the guided meetings. The implementation cost was less than $15,000. Despite many tech companies announcing that workers could remain remote going forward, leaders like JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon have called employees back to the office. Their concern about remote work largely centers on difficulties co-workers have sharing knowledge and experience with each other. For many companies, this kind of sharing is valuable — it disseminates best practices and enables those who are fumbling to seek help. It’s often taken as an article of faith that  it suffers when employees work remotely. But we’ve found successful practices to facilitate this kind of sharing that can be ported, possibly with greater efficacy, to remote teams. In a recent experiment, we set out to test how managers can facilitate knowledge sharing between coworkers and to quantify the bottom-line impact. We partnered with an inbound sales call center that collects personalized sales productivity data for each of their salespeople. Our study was motivated by the fact that, despite tremendous technological advancements in the workplace, the Pareto Principle (20% of workers generate 80% of revenue) persists to this day. What we wanted to know was: If top performers have developed best practices, could they successfully share that knowledge with others? And if so, what was stopping them from sharing it organically? There are a few plausible explanations for why top performers’ insights don’t spread to the whole team. One view — which might be an economist’s knee-jerk reaction — is that salespeople are competitive creatures with no incentive to share information. According to this perspective, companies need to give high performers explicit incentives to get them to share what they know. An alternate view maintains that humans are social creatures who will eagerly share their knowledge and experience when asked; if that’s the case, then some kind of social barrier keeps lower-performing coworkers from asking peers for help. Perhaps they don’t want to demonstrate weakness, or they want to figure out the job on their own. Either way, managers  need to find ways to encourage them to ask peers for help.  It’s possible that both explanations have merit, which implies that the group needs both incentives to share and paths for seeking help. To figure out how companies could best leverage their top performers’ knowledge, we designed tests to distinguish between these hypothesized obstacles to knowledge sharing. We randomly paired over 600 salespeople together and then put the pairs into four different groups, with each group receiving a different four-week-long managerial intervention or treatment — guided meetings, explicit incentives, a simultaneous application of both treatments, and a control. Each treatment targeted either a single hypothesized barrier or a combination of possible obstacles. To measure the bottom-line efficacy, it was important to find a setting where many workers perform identical, albeit independent, tasks and to have granular, worker-level performance measures, making our inbound sales call center an ideal setting for studying knowledge sharing practices. Structure Outperforms Incentives One managerial intervention vastly outperformed the others: the guided meetings used in the first group. In this treatment, management booked meetings in paired employees’ schedules and provided each salesperson with a self-reflective worksheet intended to surface the prior week’s challenges and triumphs in preparation for the meeting. Employee pairs were then asked to interview and record their partner’s worksheet responses on the other side of their own sheet. Armed with completed worksheets and a charter to interview their partner, management opened the door for partners to share their problems and exchange both actionable advice and encouragement. To test the alternate, neo-classical economic view that incentives reign supreme, the second group of randomly paired employees were provided incentives for them to grow their collective sales relative to their combined, individual-sales history — the idea being that explicit goal alignment would precipitate knowledge sharing. Managers did not direct workers in this group to meet or to help one another, relying instead on self-management of workers with aligned goals. A third group of workers received both the pair-performance incentives and the guided-meetings treatment, allowing us to test whether managers need a tandem focus on both breaking down social barriers and providing incentives. Comparing these three groups against a hold-out or control group reveals a striking difference in efficacy between the guided-meetings approach and the incentives-oriented one. The results suggest that the incentive program had little impact. The third group of workers (those who received both managerial interventions) also increased their sales performance; however, the outcomes closely tracked those of the employees who participated in guided meetings alone. Combined, the results strongly suggest that social frictions — say, the potential awkwardness or embarrassment from asking a high performing co-worker to meet and discuss their strategies  — were responsible for the lack of information sharing at the partner firm. Put simply, coworker interactions can improve the long, lower tail of under-performers — provided such interactions are both thoughtful and intentional. While our study took place in two physical campuses ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic, the same underlying principles are present in virtual workplaces; in fact, they may be more powerful. As many of us have come to realize, it can be incredibly difficult to discern when remote colleagues might be available to answer questions or merely to catch up, making it that much more intimidating to reach out for help. Organizations of all sizes have quickly embraced new technologies to deliver core business needs during the pandemic, and while the substitution of technology for physical presence has introduced a new layer of social frictions, it has also lowered the adoption cost of the guided meetings described above. Consider this: the very same manual, managerial interventions introduced in our partner firm’s campuses can now be automatically accomplished with Microsoft’s recently released Icebreaker-Bot for Microsoft Teams. (The authors were not involved in developing the bot.) By finding time in employee calendars and booking virtual meetings both at Microsoft and with some of their customers, the application has “made a huge difference in helping teams be more connected, inclusive, energizing, welcoming of new and remote teammates, and ultimately more emphatic and effective,” says Sid Uppal, Principal Engineering Manager at Microsoft and creator of the Icebreaker bot’s predecessor, Meetuply bot. Future research is needed to isolate the benefits associated with virtual human resource management, but combining our results with the Microsoft team’s experience to date, we are incredibly optimistic about the future of leveraging digital tools to foster social connections in the workplace, lifting morale and productivity along the way.

"64",64,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/reinventing-the-leader-selection-process","managing people.txt","The U.S. Army has long struggled with toxic and inept leaders, and no wonder: It has historically chosen battalion commanders, a linchpin position, on the basis of 90-second file reviews. Last year it undertook an ambitious revamping of that selection process, which now involves four full days of physical, cognitive, and psychological assessments and interviews. The author, a lieutenant colonel who served as an adviser to the task force that designed and implemented the new process, describes it in granular detail, including a variety of rigorous measures for reducing interviewer bias and ensuring diversity and inclusion. Although specifically aimed at improving the validity, reliability, and developmental impact of the army’s executive-leader selections, the redesigned process offers important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices. The U.S. Army needs its commanders to have competence and character. Yet in a survey of 22,000 soldiers, fully 20% reported serving under a toxic leader. Until last year the service had chosen battalion-level commanders—a linchpin position—by having senior officers independently score each candidate’s personnel file. A file review took about 90 seconds, and the key text examined in each annual performance report was shorter than a typical tweet. The army undertook an ambitious revamping of its selection process. Each candidate now undergoes four days’ worth of physical, cognitive, communication, and psychological assessments, concluding with an interview carefully designed to reduce bias. The new system holds important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices. Addressing a class of West Point cadets  in 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates asked bluntly, “How can the army break up the institutional concrete—its bureaucratic rigidity in its assignments and promotion processes—in order to retain, challenge, and inspire its best, brightest, and most-battle-tested young officers to lead the service in the future?” The question was, he said, “the greatest challenge facing your army—and frankly, my main worry.”   The secretary’s concern was not ill founded. In a 2009–2010 survey of 22,000 soldiers, 20% said they were serving under a toxic leader. Another survey showed that fewer than 50% of army majors believe the service promotes its best members. (The picture in the corporate world is similarly bleak. In one study, researchers estimated that half of senior executives were failing in their leadership duties. Another found that 16% of managers were toxic and 20% were incompetent.) In response to such feedback, the army designed an entirely new process for selecting battalion commanders—its first executive-level position, typically attained 17 to 20 years after an officer has joined the service. It chooses approximately 450 a year, each of whom is responsible for the training and development of 500 or so soldiers. Battalion commanders thus have an outsize influence on combat readiness and junior-leader talent retention; they are also the primary source of generals. That’s why Army Chief of Staff James McConville put the overhaul of their selection process at the core of his talent reform efforts. Over the coming year the first class of officers appointed under the new system will assume their commands. The selection process, which capitalizes on recent and emerging talent-management ideas from both the public and the private sector, includes physical fitness, cognitive, communication, and psychological tests; peer and subordinate feedback; and interviews rigorously designed to reduce bias. While specifically aimed at improving the validity, reliability, and developmental impact of the army’s executive leader choices, it offers important lessons for any organization seeking to bolster its talent assessment and promotion practices. It’s little wonder that the army suffered a crisis of competence in its leadership ranks. Ever since centralizing its officer selection process, in the 1980s, it had chosen battalion commanders by having multiple senior officers simply score each eligible lieutenant colonel’s file, which contained subjective performance evaluations, an assignment history, and an official photo. On average, some 1,900 officers would be eligible for consideration each year. Each file review took about 90 seconds; the key text examined in each performance evaluation was shorter than a typical tweet. Changing course in any large bureaucracy is never easy, of course, and the army faced all the usual obstacles and then some. The dominant laws governing its personnel practices had been written in 1947 and 1980. They directed that several thousand second lieutenants a year be commissioned, brought up to a minimum level of competence, and assigned and developed on the basis of seniority, specialty, and performance. People were managed largely as if they were interchangeable parts—and the system was more or less frozen in place because of its codification in law. But in 2018 Congress passed the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act, which granted the army the flexible personnel authority it had lacked. McConville—then the vice chief of staff—began making plans to improve the quality of the officer corps. The new process included cognitive, communication, and psychological assessments. McConville arguably has more HR experience than any previous army chief of staff. Having spent three years as deputy chief of staff for personnel—the service’s lead human resources officer—he has insight into the diverse talent needed in the thousands of army jobs. As a former commander of the 101st Airborne Division, he has learned that every soldier possesses unique skills and that the army’s diversity is increasing. And as the parent of three young army officers, he knows firsthand that generational norms are changing and that Millennials and Gen Zers want more control over their careers. Consider one of the problems he recognized. Let’s say the army needed to appoint an officer to advise an allied army overseas. Under its legacy system, it would identify candidates with the appropriate seniority (company commander) and specialty (logistics), perhaps reviewing their performance evaluations to make sure they ranked in the top 20% of their peers, and then choose from that pool. But whereas succeeding as a company commander mainly involves directly leading people who are similar to oneself, succeeding as an adviser abroad involves indirectly influencing people who may be quite dissimilar—and doing so in an unfamiliar environment. Simply giving the job to the best company commander would be unlikely to yield the best match. Better results could be obtained by identifying individuals with superior cognitive flexibility, cross-cultural fluency, and interpersonal skills. Moreover, if the army knew which officers enjoyed international travel and meeting people from different cultures, it could choose someone whose talents and preferences were suited to the position, most likely ending up with a high performer who would enjoy and remain in the job. Recognizing the need for adaptation that scenarios like this presented, McConville set out to transform how the army acquires, develops, employs, and retains its people, beginning with the linchpin role of battalion commander. First, the army redefined talent as the intersection of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and preferences, or KSB-Ps. Next, McConville energized and resourced the Army Talent Management Task Force—a small group of officers charged with prototyping innovative talent-management ideas—directing that inclusiveness should lie at the initiative’s core. (Disclosure: I serve as an external adviser to the task force, and I moderated one of the interview panels in the new selection process.) The task force researched army leadership doctrine and identified best practices from government, corporate, academic, and nonprofit organizations and allied militaries. It then designed the Battalion Commander Assessment Program, or BCAP: a four-day evaluation of more than 20 KSB-Ps, including communication skill, creativity, ethical leadership, and the ability to develop others. During the first three days candidates would undergo a physical fitness test, writing skill and argumentative essay examinations, cognitive and strategic talent assessments, psychometric tests, and a psychological interview. They would demonstrate their leadership and problem-solving abilities in a team-based outdoor obstacle course, and extensive peer and subordinate evaluations would be reviewed. The process would culminate on the fourth day with 30-minute interviews in which panels would evaluate candidates’ oral communication skills and decide who was ready for command. Those deemed so would be ranked according to a cumulative score informed by their BCAP assessments along with the rating assigned after a legacy-style review of their performance file (which the army still considers a valuable part of the selection process). The top 450 or so would be designated for command. Following two successful prototypes in the summer of 2019, McConville directed a full rollout of the program. During January and February 2020, 750 lieutenant colonels—eligible officers who opted to participate after being recommended on the basis of an old-style file review—gathered for the new assessment process at Fort Knox. The human brain is lazy; we are constantly looking for shortcuts when processing information. Interviewers are no exception. Research has shown that unstructured interviews are often the least-informative part of an assessment. Even experienced interviewers may spend the first 30 seconds of a meeting jumping to a conclusion about the candidate and the rest of the time subconsciously seeking information to confirm that conclusion. To guard against such shortcuts, the task force designed a full day of familiarization, calibration, and training for the BCAP panelists. Handpicked colonels were trained to serve as moderators to maintain a fair and consistent process. The work was guided by the following principles: The selection process spanned four weeks, with six panels operating simultaneously each week. Each panel had five voting and three nonvoting members and was assembled for diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity, specialty, and previous assignments. According to army tradition, voting privileges are limited to officers one level or more above the position under consideration; the voting members of each BCAP panel included three one- or two-star generals and two senior colonels, all of whom had been successful battalion- and brigade-level commanders. The nonvoting members, included to provide additional perspectives, were a command sergeant major with extensive experience advising battalion commanders, a senior operational psychologist, and the moderator. Panel members were taught strategies for preventing the attributional errors that occur most often during job interviews, including primacy (a tendency to focus on first impressions), contrast (rating candidates against one another instead of against a common standard), halo/horn (allowing a single positive or negative trait to overshadow all else), stereotyping, and similar-to-me biases. The training also emphasized the tendency among leaders to exhibit blind-spot bias: recognizing that others may be biased but falsely believing that you are not. Each morning the panelists received a brief antibias refresher before beginning their work. At the outset, panelists were given the names of the candidates and asked if they had any knowledge of them. This allowed organizers to create panels whose members had no preconceived notions about the people they were evaluating. Panelists were told to recuse themselves if they realized during an interview that they knew the candidate, which happened five times. Interviews can unfairly advantage candidates who have extensive interview experience. During the BCAP prototypes, the task force noted that whereas some lieutenant colonels were excellent interviewees, most were not. So candidates were instructed in the STAR method, which teaches people to answer questions by describing the situation, the task, the action taken, and the result. Although they were not required to use it, a majority did. To ensure a single grading standard, panel members were given a rubric for each quality to be assessed that described what was needed to attain each score. Before the panels began their assessments, they met together in practice sessions. First, each panelist independently assessed three mock candidates, and the entire group discussed the results. Members then regrouped in their panels to assess three new mock candidates and go over those results. Each group of mock candidates included one who was strong in the KSB-Ps, one who was moderately strong, and one who was weak. Borrowing a best practice devised by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1952, BCAP conducted double-blind interviews, with a black curtain separating the candidates from the panel at all times. This allowed panelists to focus on the content of answers and the KSB-Ps they were assessing rather than form judgments on the basis of ethnicity, attractiveness, or physical symbols such as wings on their uniforms. It minimized attribution biases that might be sparked by candidates’ physical presence. And it meant that deep issues could be discussed without fear of repercussions should candidates and panel members work together in the future. The task force also directed candidates not to disclose, and panel members not to ask about, specific jobs they had held or locations where they had worked. Klawe Rzeczy Although double-blind panels reduce bias (a test showed that the sergeants major incorrectly identified 50% of BCAP’s minority candidates as white), they don’t eliminate it. It’s usually easy to determine gender, and panelists may consciously or subconsciously try to link pitch, accent, speaking style, or content with a certain demographic. Candidates who learned English as a second language or hailed from the deep South, for example, might have readily discernible accents. So the bias-prevention work stressed the need not to penalize or reward speaking styles or accents. Applying a best practice long used by special operations units, BCAP brought operational psychologists into the process. Each of six senior psychologists supervised several junior colleagues conducting one-on-one interviews with candidates before their day-four interviews with panels. The senior psychologists collected summaries from the junior ones on the candidates seen that day and presented the results to the relevant panels in a standardized format. Because they did not interact with candidates themselves, they could be much more objective in conveying information about them. They also synthesized each candidate’s BCAP assessments into a summary of strengths and weaknesses and suggested follow-up questions for the panel to pose. The task force developed a bank of behavior-based questions for each KSB-P being assessed, rotating them in and out to reduce the chances of their being leaked. For instance, a candidate might be instructed to “describe a situation when you advised a subordinate about a significant challenge he or she was having.” In the first segment of each interview, the moderator asked questions from the bank in a set order, thus ensuring that all candidates had the same core experience. He or she then posed any questions the panelists had after reviewing the candidate’s performance in the first three days of events and hearing the senior psychologist’s summary. Panelists could themselves follow up with questions intended to further illuminate strengths or risks. Panel members were directed to elicit descriptions of specific situations and the actions taken in response and to avoid hypotheticals such as “would,” “could,” and “should.” For example, instead of asking, “How would you deal with an underperforming subordinate?” they might say, “Please tell us about a recent time when you developed a subordinate who was underperforming.” Candidates were required to wait 30 seconds before answering each question—an instruction driven by what psychologists know about certain personality traits. Because extroverts are typically comfortable thinking out loud, whereas introverts tend to process information silently, the waiting period was meant to ensure that the former did not have an unfair advantage. To further ensure fairness, panelists were instructed not to give feedback or discuss candidates’ answers and to refrain from any body language, such as a thumbs-up or an eye roll, that could signal approval or disapproval to fellow panelists. Borrowing a best practice from Google, which involves an applicant’s potential team members in the interview process, each panel included a command sergeant major—roughly equivalent to a general manager’s senior operations foreman. Those asked to participate had served as advisers to battalion- and brigade-level commanders and general officers and had keen insights about what the job of battalion commander requires. After each interview they shared their insights about the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses in each KSB-P. To minimize recency bias, they were directed not to indicate their overall assessment of the candidate. After the sergeant majors’ comments, panels held nonbinding votes on each KSB-P, with results visible to the moderator alone. If two panelists differed significantly on an assessment, the moderator asked them to give the reasons for their rating without sharing the actual scores. To avoid having the senior officer in the pair exert undue influence, the junior officer went first. Next, panels held their official vote. The moderator reminded members to base their ratings on the rubrics and not to identify their votes or discuss the candidates. With their votes panelists submitted comments about candidates’ developmental strengths and weaknesses in each KSB-P; those were relayed to the junior psychologists, who conducted a short “out briefing” with each candidate. To ensure consistency and fairness across panels, the general directing the BCAP initiative held daily meetings with the moderators, giving guidance and asking for input on issues, voting trends, and needs. Each day he observed at least one interview per panel via a live closed-circuit camera system. He would occasionally drop into panel rooms where members were wrestling with procedural issues and offer advice. The six moderators, the director, and a panel coordinator communicated regularly on a closed channel, sharing issues, concerns, and best practices in real time. Panelists could ask that the director observe their panel or visit it before or after an interview to clarify procedural concerns; such requests were accommodated rapidly, often within seconds. The organizational change expert John Kotter holds that a crucial step in leading change is building a guiding coalition. BCAP asked for input or participation from several key stakeholder groups: peers and subordinates of the candidates, including the sergeants major, and general officers. Prior to the assessments at Fort Knox, BCAP leaders emailed 10-minute surveys to candidates’ peer and subordinate officers. The pivotal question: Should the individual be given a battalion command? More than 65% of recipients responded (response rates for army surveys typically fall below 15%). In reviewing the survey results, panelists were reminded that leaders sometimes have to be stern and that they should consider negative feedback in context: If a clear majority of answers about a candidate were positive, negative responses to one or two items should be deemed outliers. A vast majority of the candidates were recommended for command by a vast majority of their peers and subordinates—suggesting that most lieutenant colonels are leading well, although some are not. Candidates completed the BCAP process regardless of the survey responses, since those were just one of several factors considered. The army’s current generals rose through the ranks via the old selection process, so careful thought had to be given to obtaining their buy-in. McConville asked the service’s 12 four-star generals to weight the assessments used to generate candidates’ final scores, thus signaling that senior leadership was behind the program and that everyone else was expected to be too. As mentioned, three one- or two-star generals sat on each panel. Because the selection process involved 24 panels in all—six panels in each of the four weeks—72 of the army’s one- and two-star generals, or more than 20%, took part. The BCAP assessments cost $2.5 million in travel fees, supplies, equipment, and so on, along with the opportunity cost of participants’ time. What did the army gain in return? BCAP’s most immediate impact will be on the soldiers led by the 436 newly selected battalion commanders. Remarkably, 150 of the new commanders, or 34%, would not have been chosen on the basis of legacy-style file reviews alone; although their file scores did not place them among the top candidates, their strengths in the BCAP assessments lifted them into that group. Moreover, 25 candidates whose file reviews would have earned them a posting under the old system were deemed “not ready for command” by their interview panels, many because they exhibited strong and consistent evidence of toxicity. Since future generals will be drawn mainly from today’s battalion commanders, these results mean that tens of thousands of soldiers (and their families) ultimately stand to benefit from commanders who are more fit, more capable, better communicators, and more thoughtful. (The army generally doesn’t publish demographic information about those selected for command.) The process also generated benefits for the candidates, regardless of whether they were tapped for command. The week at Fort Knox reconnected them with old acquaintances and introduced them to new ones. As we know from network theory and social psychology, strong professional networks increase one’s ability to get things done, while strong personal networks boost emotional stability and well-being. And all candidates (even those denied the promotion) were offered follow-on leadership development with a civilian executive coach, to work on findings from the process or on self-identified areas for improvement. A majority signed on, including 64% of male officers and 84% of female ones. Even seasoned interviewers may instantly jump to a conclusion about a candidate. In exit surveys 96% of the candidates, including 98% of women and 96% of minority officers, said that BCAP was a better way to select commanders. Two months later, after candidates had learned the results, 97% thought the new program should be continued. Some 11% called for major modifications—such as additional feedback, different evaluation criteria and events, and alternative assessment timelines—that will be analyzed and addressed for the future. Follow-up surveys and an after-action review revealed an unanticipated benefit: panelists’ own development. Although some generals initially questioned why they had to spend valuable time improving the process by which they had been chosen, in the end 95% of the panelists said they believed it was a better way to select battalion commanders. Some were grateful to be refreshed on the issues facing younger leaders. Many reflected on their own leadership behaviors, often commenting that the training made them aware of their biases and the need to lead more inclusively. The process also provided important information about the panelists. In a few years the army will know which new commanders are successful. Because it recorded all the votes on each candidate, it could identify especially effective evaluators and invite them to serve on other selection boards. And the initiative’s effects extend beyond those who went to Fort Knox. BCAP opened the army’s eyes to the possibility of creating a broader culture of evaluation and feedback. Some West Point instructors have adapted the writing rubrics for use in teaching cadets. At least one army unit is organizing a mock BCAP so that future candidates can increase their fitness and their writing and oral skills. The service is also considering using many of the assessments for the development of officers with four or five years of experience. The evaluations could be repeated several years later, allowing officers to see how they had grown (or not). At both points they could help officers and the army alike optimize assignments and development programs. As officers practice the skills spotlighted in the assessments, their abilities will increase, making for stronger leaders even among those who are never chosen for a battalion command. Finally, the army has used the BCAP template to design a similar program for selecting brigade-level commanders. And building on BCAP’s inclusion efforts, the Talent Management Task Force recently established a formal diversity and inclusion initiative that extends across its various programs. BCAP has given the army the most carefully vetted class of battalion leaders in its history. Candidates say they gained valuable perspectives and learned much about themselves. Soldiers asked to evaluate peer and superior officers were sent a clear message that their opinions matter and that leaders are expected to treat them with respect. Generals and colonels serving on the panels received a powerful refresher in what junior officers experience in their daily jobs and the skills they need to do them well. Many panelists also underwent the most thorough bias-reduction training they have ever received—which should drive more-inclusive treatment of the people they themselves lead."

They say something like “You need certain important intangibles” or “You don’t have enough gravitas,” but they fail to provide advice or guidance. What they’re talking about is leadership style. In every interaction, we send signals to others that fall into two categories: power and attractiveness. Powerful markers are associated with confidence, competence, charisma, and influence but also arrogance, abrasiveness, and intimidation. Attractiveness markers are related to agreeableness, approachability, and likability but also diffidence, lack of confidence, and submissiveness. The more consistent our signals, the more distinctive our style. This practical guide offers concrete advice for developing a dynamic and effective leadership style that draws from both types of markers for maximum impact. Bosses often sense that something is lacking in an employee’s tool kit but can’t put a finger on what it is. They say something like “You’re missing important intangibles” or “You need more gravitas” but fail to provide advice or guidance. What they’re talking about is leadership style. In every interaction, we send signals to others about our power and status. The more consistent we are in our signals, the more distinctive our style becomes. This practical guide offers concrete advice for developing a dynamic and effective leadership style, including tips such as what volume and pace to use in your speech, whether to take notes in a meeting, and how and when to interrupt others. Few things are more frustrating for talented  professionals than hitting a ceiling in their careers because they lack the appropriate leadership style. A boss senses that something is missing in a person’s tool kit but can’t put a finger on exactly what it is or how the person can improve. The boss says something like “You’re lacking important intangibles” or “You need more gravitas” but fails to provide specific advice or tools for improving. It is equally frustrating to watch people with mediocre technical skills move up the ladder quickly because they have an exceptional leadership style. Bosses defend such promotions by emphasizing the employees’ soft skills, calling them “poised,” “confident,” and “dynamic.” The truth is that these things matter: A great leadership style can make people appear more competent than they truly are, and a poor style can drag down a superior skill set. So how can aspiring executives improve their leadership style? First, it’s important to understand that style is distinct from personality. The latter is immutable; it’s who you are on the inside. Style is best described by what you do, how often, and when. More than 30 years ago, the sociolinguist Howard Giles and colleagues first identified a set of behaviors, or social markers, that we all use to express ourselves and by which we evaluate others. These markers are a language we learn in childhood, as we begin to see that people behave differently depending on whether they hold status or not. Older siblings may bark at you for the remote control, for example, but behave obsequiously to parents when they want to borrow the car. Social markers can be expressed through language, nonverbal communication (such as body language), or context setting (sitting at the head of the table, for instance). Your choice of markers determines how others view you. Through our own academic research and a combined 30 years of proprietary research, including engagements with more than 12,000 leaders in our executive coaching practice, we have identified the markers most commonly used in the workplace to express status. 
  Together, they make up leadership style. The signals used to communicate status fall into two categories. The signals we send to others about our status—or lack thereof—fall into two categories: power and attractiveness. Neither set of markers is inherently good or bad. Powerful markers are associated with expressions of confidence, competence, charisma, and influence but also arrogance, abrasiveness, and intimidation. Examples include interrupting others and grabbing a pen off someone’s desk without permission. Attractiveness markers are related to expressions of agreeableness, approachability, likability but also diffidence, lack of confidence, and submissiveness. Examples include holding the door for someone and favoring questions over statements. People with powerful styles often view more-attractive colleagues as weak. People with attractive styles tend to view powerful colleagues as rude. The more consistently we express ourselves using the same markers, the more distinctive our style becomes. When a colleague gives the impression of being arrogant, for example, it’s most likely because he uses a small set of powerful behaviors consistently. Or when a manager offers an appraisal such as “Kristin simply does not have a seat at the table with her peers,” that usually means she uses too many attractiveness markers—perhaps she never states her views publicly, or she speaks so softly that people ask her to repeat what she said. Change the frequency or mix of these markers, and others’ impressions also change. We all have a particular set of markers that we default to in neutral situations or when the social context is unclear. This can be called our natural style. We behave more powerfully relative to our natural style when we feel we have the status (for example, we are the more senior, educated, experienced, technical, or connected person in a workplace interaction). We behave more attractively relative to our natural style when we are the more junior or less-experienced person. Most people’s natural style falls into one of five categories along a spectrum: powerful, lean powerful, blended, lean attractive, and attractive. Few people favor the extremes, instead leaning to one side or the other. A truly blended style is rare and involves an equal use of both power and attractiveness markers. A blended style can be best summed up as having “presence.” Leaders who are praised for their polish and gravitas have a deft ability to adopt the right markers to suit the situation. Julia Marie Werner Our research on blended leadership styles is similar in concept to that of social psychologist Amy Cuddy on warmth and competence. But whereas Cuddy and colleagues generally advise leaders to first project warmth to gain trust and then display their competence to gain credibility, we believe that power and attractiveness should be dynamic. Some situations will call for a leader to exhibit powerful markers from the outset; some will call for a more attractive approach throughout. Leaders often need to tweak their style multiple times in a day—sometimes in the course of a single situation. In one meeting, a leader may need to gain the respect of her peers by projecting subject matter expertise and strong advocacy. But in the next meeting, she may want to be seen as a collaborative partner and will choose to lean attractive by listening attentively and asking more questions. Cuddy and others instruct leaders to focus on how they feel (feeling strong will help you project strength, and feeling warm will help you project warmth). Our work with executives focuses on their actions and behaviors. Power and attractiveness are determined by what you display toward others, regardless of how you feel on the inside. For instance, you may be very nervous going into a large presentation, but by consciously favoring power markers, you can project confidence, and your audience will be none the wiser. In our work, we have observed thousands of leaders who have successfully experimented with markers, created a blended style, and reaped professional rewards as a result. Some developed a blended style early in their work lives; those leaders are the “naturals.” But others struggled to move up the ladder and learned to modify their behavior—often through painful trial and error. The learning curve can be steep, but we believe that any leader can achieve a blended style by following several steps. To balance powerful and attractive markers, you must first diagnose where you fall on the leadership style spectrum. Often, executives can read between the lines when they receive feedback from managers, peers, romantic partners, or even their own children. Comments such as “You’re too nice” and “You need to speak up” might suggest a tendency toward attractive markers. Comments such as “You’re intimidating” or “You don’t listen to me” might suggest an overly powerful style. There’s no shortage of people around you who can provide helpful insight; just ask them. If you’re unsure where you fall on the spectrum, keep a list of markers in front of you during various interactions and check off the ones you use. Which column ends up with more check marks? As more meetings move online because of the pandemic, it is an ideal time to try recording video meetings and assessing your behavior after the fact. Once you have a sense of where you fall on the spectrum, begin to experiment with markers to try to move toward a more-blended style. As a start, pick one verbal and one nonverbal marker and find a way to use both during an interaction. This may feel foreign at first; rehearsing with a friend, mentor, or coach can help make the new behaviors more familiar. The interpretation of style markers can vary significantly by culture, context, and industry. A behavior that is considered a power marker in one situation may be considered attractive in another. For example: In the United States, making eye contact with managers senior to you is often seen as a marker of confidence. The same behavior in Brazil is seen as appropriately deferential (and not making eye contact is considered rude). In Japan, it is viewed as insubordinate and disrespectful. In all three contexts eye contact is a key marker of status, yet it is interpreted differently in each. How one dresses is a universal marker of status and influence. In some African countries wearing tribal dress is a power marker for both men and women. In the United States, people’s attire is judged according to the norms of the business. A tech founder entering a meeting with investment bankers (most likely all wearing suits) in a T-shirt and jeans is displaying a power marker. An applicant for a low-level service position who arrives in a suit is displaying an attractive marker by showing an eagerness to impress. In the United States, note-taking in meetings with senior leaders or clients can be perceived as too deferential. In contrast, in South Korea, not taking notes when speaking with senior leaders may be construed as disrespectful, suggesting that you do not think what they’re saying is important or worth remembering. In Western cultures, sitting at the head of the table for a conference or a meal is considered a power move. The same holds true in Japan, but with additional intricacies. As a rule, the area of a room closest to the entrance is where the shimoza, or “bottom seat,” is located. The area closest to the tokonoma (a formal alcove for calligraphy or flowers) is the kamiza, or “highest seat.” In the absence of a formal tokonoma, a window—or simply the seat farthest from the entrance—signifies the highest position. The guest of honor sits in the kamiza, and the host and other guests seat themselves on downward, toward the shimoza. As you become more adept, add to your repertoire. We suggest a “pick and mix” approach—taking a selection of powerful and attractive markers and experimenting with them. Consider in advance how you want to be seen in a given situation and then choose markers that reinforce that style. If you want to be seen as a trusted adviser, lean attractive. If you want to be seen as a respected adversary, use mostly powerful markers. But don’t go overboard: One or two markers in each category should be sufficient to establish or alter others’ impression of you. As you experiment, some markers will be easy to adopt, but others may feel contrived—and that’s OK. Emulating the style of others or flexing your own in new ways to create a broader range for yourself does not make you inauthentic; it means you’re growing as a leader. Successful leaders are true to who they are while continually making small adjustments in how they carry themselves, how they communicate, and how they interact depending on the circumstances. Consider football coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to five world championships and remains an enduring symbol of leadership. After struggling early in his career as he transitioned from college football to the NFL, he quickly learned that he had to adjust his leadership style. What worked with his college players was not effective with the pros. In his first job as the offensive coach for the New York Giants, his style, which fell on the extreme end of powerful, antagonized and alienated his more-seasoned players. Julia Marie Werner According to When Pride Still Mattered, by David Maraniss, Lombardi was seen as loud and arrogant. The players referred to him as “Little General” and “Little Mussolini.” But then something unexpected happened: Lombardi adjusted. “He began roaming the hall of the Willamette dorm at night, visiting with the…players,” Maraniss writes. “He acknowledged that he had much to learn and sought their advice, help, and loyalty….He tried to become one of the guys, not the authoritarian boss but the smarter older brother; they called him Vince or Vinnie, not Coach or Mr. Lombardi. He drank beers with them, laughed loudly at their jokes, told them how much he wanted them to succeed.” An executive we worked with—we’ll call him Martin—had a similar problem. He grew tired of the constant feedback that he was intimidating, domineering, and coercive. Our observations revealed that Martin, like many other people we’ve studied, exhibited a much more powerful style in professional settings than he did in other social contexts. To help him soften his style, we asked him to adopt four specific markers of attractiveness. First, we pointed out how often he interrupted and talked over others, especially in group situations, and asked him to reduce those interjections. That took some time, but eventually he learned to wait for others to finish before commenting. Second, we asked him to accompany his opinions with questions more often. That was also a difficult adjustment because he maintained a strong preference for declarative statements. Third, we asked him to incorporate “partnership language” by using fewer “I” references and more “we” and “our” references. That was easier for Martin; he deeply valued inclusive language and had not noticed his overuse of self-referential (“I,” “me”) and possessive (“my team”) expressions. Last, we asked him to demonstrate empathetic listening by slowing down and restating what he had heard from others. The unintended consequence was that he also made more eye contact when he listened—another attractive marker. Martin was highly committed to changing his style, and it worked. After six months, colleagues noticed a favorable difference. By moving from a powerful style to one that leaned powerful instead, Martin began to earn more-favorable evaluations. One question we often get from executives is how to know when to lean powerful and when to lean attractive. Gaining an ability to “read the room” is part of fine-tuning your leadership style. Although you may have an idea of how you want to be perceived when entering a situation, your plan may need to change once you’re actually there. Generally speaking, you should assess the markers you’re receiving from others before deciding on your own approach. More often than not, if you’re receiving power markers from someone, you will want to match them to garner respect. Similarly, if you’re reading attractive markers from others, you’ll want to lean attractive so as not to seem overbearing. Executives make a common mistake by using power markers with subordinates and attractive markers with higher-ups. The opposite approach is often more effective. Using power markers with juniors—such as ignoring them, abruptly changing topics, or talking too much in their presence—can make you less effective. In contrast, using too many attractive markers—phrasing statements as questions, speaking more slowly, and using nonfluencies (such as “um” and “you know”)—can lead executives to conclude that you’re not their peer. Overemphasizing attractive markers when communicating upward to show respect is particularly likely to backfire in U.S.-based companies. To solve this problem, lean powerful with more-senior people, and lean attractive when talking to more-junior people. Our research and coaching are complicated by the fact that leadership style cannot be fully divorced from unconscious biases and discrimination. Leadership is a normative construct; when asked to “draw a leader,” people (regardless of their gender) tend to draw a man. Research shows that women face a competency-likability trade-off: The more they demonstrate proficiency, the more likely their peers are to find their style off-putting. Minorities and LGBTQ executives who look or act in a manner that doesn’t conform to an organization’s dominant culture may also be penalized by colleagues who characterize them (perhaps unconsciously) as “not like us.” To determine where your natural style falls on the leadership spectrum, be open to the feedback you hear from managers, coworkers, friends, and family members, and identify common themes. Despite the fact that the hallmarks of leadership style are similar around the world, people of diverse groups are often judged differently even when they display identical style markers. When a woman disagrees with her colleagues, for example, she may be labeled “abrasive” or “aggressive,” while her male colleague is seen as “candid” or “direct.” We certainly don’t advise women and minorities not to get angry, disagree, or promote their accomplishments. Rather, we advise them to carefully select markers that will help them develop a blended style. The right assortment can allow you to show loyalty to the group you want to lead while still maintaining your uniqueness. Certain minority leaders will want to adopt more power markers; others will need more attractive markers. But again, don’t go overboard. Altering your style to conform in a way that hides your diverse traits, or overplaying your differences in a way that distracts from your leadership, can backfire. Women must walk a narrow tightrope: They must have the courage to interrupt, use fewer nonfluencies, and use more-intense words while blending in more relational and empathetic responses, statements as questions, and happy expressions. Male leaders who are perceived as outliers in a group also have a small margin for error. We wish this weren’t the case—but as long as unconscious bias and discrimination exist, minorities and women will need to put extra effort into developing a blended leadership style. The late U.S. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg used a blended style to her advantage. She was known for her ability to “disagree agreeably”—which helped her create unlikely friendships with more-conservative judges and foster loyal followership beyond the Court. No pushover, she picked her battles wisely and used attractive markers when necessary. As she wrote about her style, “reacting in anger or annoyance will not advance one’s ability to persuade.” In our research and consulting, we have seen that style is a significant differentiating factor in the reputation and career success of leaders. The good news is that style isn’t like personality—it can be intentionally altered. Dynamically integrating a broader range of powerful and attractive markers in everyday interactions can make a big difference in how we are perceived. The result is a true blended style that enables leaders to become powerful enough to be heard and attractive enough to be followed. Suzanne J.

This has notable benefits: Companies can save on real estate costs, hire and utilize talent globally, mitigate immigration issues, and experience productivity gains, while workers can enjoy geographic flexibility. At the same time, concerns include how to communicate across time zones, share knowledge that isn’t yet codified, socialize virtually and prevent professional isolation, protect client data, and avoid slacking. Research into work-from-anywhere (WFA) organizations and groups that include the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Tata Consultancy Services, and GitLab (the world’s largest all-remote company) highlights best practices and can help leaders decide whether remote work is right for their organizations. The Covid-19 lockdowns proved that it is not only possible but perhaps preferable for knowledge workers to do their jobs from anywhere. Will this mark a long-term shift into all-remote work? Studies show that working from home yields numerous benefits for both individuals and their organizations, most notably in the form of enhanced productivity and engagement. But when all or most employees are remote, challenges arise for communication, knowledge sharing, socialization, performance evaluation, security, and more. As more companies adopt work-from-anywhere policies, best practices are emerging. The experiences of GitLab, Tata Consultancy Services, Zapier, and others show how the risks associated with this type of work can be overcome. Before 2020 a movement was brewing within  knowledge-work organizations. Personal technology and digital connectivity had advanced so far and so fast that people had begun to ask, “Do we really need to be together, in an office, to do our work?” We got our answer during the pandemic lockdowns. We learned that a great many of us don’t in fact need to be colocated with colleagues on-site to do our jobs. Individuals, teams, entire workforces, can perform well while being entirely distributed—and they have. So now we face new questions: Are all-remote or majority-remote organizations the future of knowledge work? Is work from anywhere (WFA) here to stay?   Without question, the model offers notable benefits to companies and their employees. Organizations can reduce or eliminate real estate costs, hire and use talent globally while mitigating immigration issues, and, research indicates, perhaps enjoy productivity gains. Workers get geographic flexibility (that is, live where they prefer to), eliminate commutes, and report better work/life balance. However, concerns persist regarding how WFA affects communication, including brainstorming and problem-solving; knowledge sharing; socialization, camaraderie, and mentoring; performance evaluation and compensation; and data security and regulation. To better understand how leaders can capture the upside of WFA while overcoming the challenges and avoiding negative outcomes, I’ve studied several companies that have embraced all- or majority-remote models. They include the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO (which has several thousand WFA workers); Tulsa Remote; Tata Consultancy Services, or TCS (a global IT services company that has announced a plan to be 75% remote by 2025); GitLab (the world’s largest all-remote company, with 1,300 employees); Zapier (a workflow automation company with more than 300 employees, none of them colocated, around the United States and in 23 other countries); and MobSquad (a Canadian start-up that employs WFA workers). The Covid-19 crisis has opened senior leaders’ minds to the idea of adopting WFA for all or part of their workforces. In addition to TCS, companies including Twitter, Facebook, Shopify, Siemens, and State Bank of India have announced that they will make remote work permanent even after a vaccine is available. Another organization I’ve studied is BRAC, one of the world’s largest NGOs, which is headquartered in Bangladesh. Forced into remote work this year, it is deciding what work model to adopt for the long term. If your organization is considering a WFA program, transition, or launch, this article can provide a guide. A large-scale transition from traditional, colocated work to remote work arguably began with the adoption of work-from-home (WFH) policies in the 1970s, as soaring gasoline prices caused by the 1973 OPEC oil embargo made commuting more expensive. Those policies allowed people to eschew physical offices in favor of their homes, coworking spaces, or other community locations, such as coffee shops and public libraries, for occasional days, on a regular part-time basis, or full-time, with the expectation that they would come into the office periodically. Workers were often also given control over their schedules, allowing them to make time for school pickups, errands, or midday exercise without being seen as shirking. They saved time by commuting less and tended to take fewer sick days. Thanks to the advent of personal computers, the internet, email, broadband connectivity, laptops, cell phones, cloud computing, and videotelephony, the adoption of WFH increased in the 2000s. As the researchers Ravi S. Gajendran and David A. Harrison note in a 2007 article, this trend was accelerated by the need to comply with, for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and mandates of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Millennials were excited by the idea of traveling the world while still employed. Research has shown performance benefits. A 2015 study by Nicholas Bloom and coauthors found that when employees opted in to WFH policies, their productivity increased by 13%. When, nine months later, the same workers were given a choice between remaining at home and returning to the office, those who chose the former saw even further improvements: They were 22% more productive than they had been before the experiment. This suggests that people should probably determine for themselves the situation (home or office) that fits them best. In recent years many companies have allowed more employees to work from home. It’s true that several prominent corporations, including Yahoo and IBM, had reversed course before the pandemic, asking their employees to resume colocated work in a bid to spur more-effective collaboration. But other organizations—the ones I study—moved toward greater geographic flexibility, allowing some if not all employees, new and old, to work from anywhere, completely untethered to an office. The USPTO is a prime example. Its leaders launched a WFA program in 2012, building on an existing WFH program that mandated workers’ physical presence at headquarters, in northern Virginia, at least one day a week. The WFA program, in contrast, requires employees to spend two years at HQ followed by a WFH phase, after which they may live anywhere in the continental United States, provided they’re willing to pay out of pocket for periodic travel back to headquarters (totaling no more than 12 days a year). The patent examiners in the program dispersed all across the country, choosing to move closer to family, to better climates, or to places with a lower cost of living. Most companies that offer WFH or WFA options keep some workers—at the USPTO it’s trainees and administrators—at one or more offices. In other words, they are hybrid-remote operations. But the experiment with all-remote work forced by Covid-19 has caused some of these organizations to strategically move toward majority-remote, with fewer than 50% of employees colocated in physical offices. TCS, for example, which employs close to 418,000 people who were traditionally located either on campuses or at client sites around the world, has decided to adopt a 25/25 model: Employees will spend only 25% of their working hours in the office, and at no point will the company have more than 25% of workers colocated. TCS plans to complete this transition in five years. Even before the crisis, a smaller group of companies had taken this trend a step further, eliminating offices altogether and dispersing everyone, from entry-level associates to the CEO. GitLab embraces this model at scale: Its remote workers span sales, engineering, marketing, personnel management, and executive roles in more than 60 countries. I’ve spent the past five years studying the practices and productivity trends of WFA companies. The upsides—for individuals, companies, and society—are clear. Let me outline them. One striking finding is how greatly workers benefit from these arrangements. Many told me that they regard the freedom to live anywhere in the world as an important plus. For those in dual-career situations, it eases the pain of looking for two jobs in a single location. One patent examiner told me, “I’m a military spouse, which means I live in a world with frequent moves and personal upheavals that prevent many spouses from pursuing lasting careers of their choice. WFA has been the most meaningful telework program I have encountered. It allows me to follow my husband to any U.S. state at a moment’s notice and pursue my own aspirations to contribute to my home and society.” Sejkko Some cited a better quality of life. “WFA has allowed my children to see their grandparents on a regular basis and play with their cousins,” I heard from another USPTO employee. “Being closer to family has improved my overall happiness.” Others talked about proximity to medical care for children, accommodating their partners, and the ability to enjoy warmer weather, prettier views, and greater recreational opportunities. Millennials in particular seemed captivated by the idea that WFA would allow them to become “digital nomads,” traveling the world while still employed. Before the pandemic-related restrictions, some companies, such as Remote Year, were aiming to facilitate that lifestyle, and some countries, such as Estonia and Barbados, have created a new class of employment visa for such workers. As one patent examiner said, “Participation in [WFA] is outstanding for work/life balance. I live in my favorite part of the country…I have more time to relax.” Cost of living was another frequent theme. Because the USPTO did not adjust salaries according to where employees chose to live, one patent examiner told me, “I was able to buy a large home in my new location for about a quarter of the cost in northern Virginia.” Some localities, such as the state of Vermont and the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma (where Tulsa Remote is located), have made a concerted effort to lure remote workers, touting the local community and lower costs. In San Francisco the average rent on a two-bedroom apartment is $4,128; in Tulsa it’s a mere $675. WFA also helps knowledge workers deal with immigration issues and other restrictions on their ability to secure good jobs. William Kerr, Susie Ma, and I recently studied MobSquad, whose coworking spaces in Halifax, Calgary, and other cities enable talented knowledge workers to bypass the onerous U.S. visa and green card system and instead obtain fast-track work permits from Canada’s Global Talent Stream. Thus they can continue serving companies and clients in the United States and other countries while living and paying taxes in Canada. One engineer we interviewed had come to the United States after graduating from high school in his home country at the age of 12. At age 16 he enrolled at a U.S. university, where he acquired degrees in math, physics, and computer science in three years. By age 19 he was employed at a medical tech company through the optional practical training (OPT) program, but he failed to get an H-1B visa and faced deportation. MobSquad moved him to Calgary, and he kept working with the same employer. In interviews with female employees at BRAC, I learned that women whose careers were previously limited by cultural taboos against traveling to remote places or delegating housework had been helped by WFA. As one explained, “Earlier I had to wake up early in the morning and cook three meals for my intergenerational family. Working remotely has allowed me to spread out the household work, get extra sleep, and be more productive.” My research also uncovered ample organizational benefits from WFA programs. For example, they increase employee engagement—an important metric of success for any company. In 2013, a year after it instituted work from anywhere, the USPTO was ranked highest on the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey. Workers are not only happier but also more productive. When Cirrus Foroughi, Barbara Larson, and I evaluated the USPTO’s transition from WFH to WFA, the timing of which happened at random for workers who’d chosen that path, we found that WFA boosted individual productivity by 4.4%, as measured by the number of patents examined each month. The switch also led examiners to exert greater effort. Of course, further research is needed to determine whether WFA generates similar benefits for workers performing different tasks in other team structures and organizations. Work-from-anywhere may reverse the brain drain that can plague emerging markets. Some gains generated by WFA are more obvious. For example, fewer in-office employees means smaller space requirements and reduced real estate costs. The USPTO estimated that increases in remote work in 2015 saved it $38.2 million. WFA programs also hugely expand an organization’s potential talent pool to include workers tied to a location far from that of the company. That’s a primary reason for the adoption at TCS of what it calls secure borderless workspaces, or SBWs: It wants to ensure that every project is staffed by employees with the right skills, no matter where they are. Rajesh Gopinathan, the CEO, describes this model as “talent on the cloud,” while another senior executive says it will potentially allow the company to tap niche labor markets, such as Eastern Europe, that have a large supply of skilled financial analysts and data scientists. Finally, WFA can reduce attrition. Some USPTO workers explained that because they loved their preferred locales but also recognized the limited job opportunities there, they were motivated to work harder and stay longer with the Patent Office. Leaders at GitLab, too, pointed to employee retention as a positive outcome of the company’s decision to be all-remote. The net benefit, they believe, including the productivity increases and property cost savings they’ve seen, equals $18,000 a year for each worker. WFA organizations have the potential to reverse the brain drain that often plagues emerging markets, small towns, and rural locations. In fact, Tulsa Remote was established to attract diverse, energetic, community-minded newcomers to a city still healing from historic race riots a century ago. With an offer of $10,000 to relocate to Tulsa, the company attracted more than 10,000 applications for just 250 slots from 2019 to 2020. Obum Ukabam was one of the workers chosen. When he’s not busy with his day job as a marketing manager, he mentors and coaches a local high school debate team. Talented newcomers of varied ethnicities are arguably making the city more multicultural. Meanwhile, the transitions at the USPTO and TCS have brought many people back to their hometowns. Remote work helps the environment as well. In 2018 Americans’ commute time averaged 27.1 minutes each way, or about 4.5 hours a week. Eliminating that commute—particularly in places where most people commute by car—generates a significant reduction in emissions. The USPTO estimates that in 2015 its remote workers drove 84 million fewer miles than if they had been traveling to headquarters, reducing carbon emissions by more than 44,000 tons. The office—with its meeting rooms and break areas and opportunities for both formal and informal interaction—has been a way of life for so long that it’s hard to imagine getting rid of it. And legitimate hurdles exist to making all-remote work not only manageable but successful. However, the Covid-19 all-remote experiment has taught many knowledge-work organizations and their employees that with time and attention, those concerns can be addressed. And in the companies I’ve studied, several best practices are emerging. When workers are distributed, synchronous communication becomes more difficult. Tools such as Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, and Google Hangouts can help for those working in the same or similar time zones but not for those spread farther apart. In research with Jasmina Chauvin and Tommy Pan Fang, I found that when changing to or from daylight saving time caused a one- to two-hour reduction in business-hour overlap (BHO) between offices of a very large global corporation, the volume of communication fell by 9.2%, primarily among production workers. When BHO was greater, R&D staffers conducted more unplanned synchronous calls. Group meetings are even harder to schedule. Nadia Vatalidis of GitLab’s People Operations group says that having team members in Manila, Nairobi, Johannesburg, Raleigh, and Boulder made finding a time for their weekly group call nearly impossible. WFA organizations must therefore get comfortable with asynchronous communication, whether through a Slack channel, a customized intracompany portal, or even a shared Google document in which geographically distributed team members write their questions and comments and trust that other team members in distant time zones will respond at the first opportunity. One benefit to this approach is that employees are more likely to share early-stage ideas, plans, and documents and to welcome early feedback; the pressure to present polished work is less than it would be in more formal, synchronous team meetings. GitLab calls this process blameless problem-solving. The company’s leaders note that employees accustomed to a culture of emails, phone calls, and meetings may struggle to change old habits; they solve that problem with training during onboarding and beyond. At Zapier, in a program called Zap Pal, each new hire is matched with an experienced buddy who sets up at least one introductory Zoom call and continues to check in throughout the first month. For synchronous brainstorming the company uses video calls and online whiteboards such as Miro, Stormboard, IPEVO Annotator, Limnu, and MURAL but also urges employees to use asynchronous means of problem-solving through Slack channel threads. This is another challenge for all-remote or majority-remote organizations. Distributed colleagues can’t tap one another on the shoulder to ask questions or get help. Research by Robin Cowan, Paul David, and Dominique Forayhas postulated that much workplace knowledge is not codified (even when it can be) and instead resides “in people’s heads.” This is a problem for all organizations, but much more so for those that have embraced WFA. The companies I’ve studied solve it with transparent and easily accessible documentation. At GitLab all team members have access to a “working handbook,” which some describe as “the central repository for how we run the company.” It currently consists of 5,000 searchable pages. All employees are encouraged to add to it and taught how to create a new topic page, edit an existing one, embed video, and so forth. Ahead of meetings, organizers post agendas that link to the relevant sections to allow invitees to read background information and post questions. Afterward recordings of the sessions are posted on GitLab’s YouTube channel, agendas are edited, and the handbook is updated to reflect any decisions made. About the art: Sejkko grew up between Portugal and Venezuela. His photographs capture the traditional houses of Portugal yet often convey a sense of tropical vibrancy and childhood nostalgia. Sometimes they look lost or out of place; other times they seem warm and self-contained. | Sejkko Employees may see the extra work of documentation as a “tax” and balk at the extremely high level of transparency necessary for a WFA organization to thrive. Thorsten Grohsjean and I have argued that senior managers must set an example on these fronts by codifying knowledge and freely sharing information while explaining that these are necessary trade-offs to allow for geographic flexibility. A related idea is to create transcripts, publicly post slides, and record video seminars, presentations, and meetings to create a repository of such material that individuals can view asynchronously at their convenience. For its 2020 annual meeting, which was forced by the pandemic to go virtual, the Academy of Management curated 1,120 prerecorded sessions, arguably expanding the flow of knowledge to scholars—especially those in emerging markets—far more than would have been possible at the in-person event, which typically happens in North America. Another major worry, cited by managers and workers alike, is the potential for people to feel isolated socially and professionally, disconnected from colleagues and the company itself, particularly in organizations where some people are colocated and some are not. Research by Cecily D. Cooper and Nancy B. Kurland has shown that remote workers often feel cut off from the information flow they would typically get in a physical office. Without in-person check-ins, managers may miss signs of growing burnout or team dysfunction. Even with videoconferencing that allows for reading body language and facial expressions, the concern is that virtual colleagues are less likely to become close friends because their face-to-face interactions are less frequent. As GitLab’s technical evangelist Priyanka Sharma put it, “I was very nervous when I was first thinking of joining, because I was very social in the office. I worried that I would be so lonely at home and wouldn’t have that community feel.” Houda Elyazgi, a marketing executive on the Tulsa Remote team, expressed similar sentiments: “Remote work can be very isolating, especially for introverts. You almost have to create an intentional experience when you’re socializing with others. And then you have to be ‘on’ all the time, even when you’re trying to relax. That’s taxing.” In my research I’ve seen a range of policies that seek to address these concerns and create opportunities for socialization and the spreading of company norms. Many WFA organizations rely on technology to help facilitate virtual watercoolers and “planned randomized interactions,” whereby someone in the company schedules groups of employees to chat online. Some use AI and virtual reality tools to pair up remote colleagues for weekly chats. For example, Sike Insights is using data on individual communication styles and AI to create Slackbot buddies, while eXp Realty, an all-remote company I’m currently researching, uses a VR platform called VirBELA to create a place for distant team members to gather in avatar form. All-remote companies must work harder to protect corporate and customer data. Sid Sijbrandij, a cofounder and the CEO of GitLab, told me, “I know at Pixar they placed the restroom centrally so people would bump into each other—but why depend on randomness for that? Why not step it up a notch and actually organize the informal communication?” These “mixers” often include senior and C-suite executives. When I described them to my HBS colleague Christina Wallace, she gave them a nice name: community collisions. And companies have always needed to manufacture them: Research dating back to Thomas J. Allen’s work at MIT in the 1970s shows that workers colocated on the same “campus” may not experience serendipitous interactions if they are separated by a wall, a ceiling, or a building. When it comes to interaction between people at different hierarchical levels, my research has revealed two problems with straightforward solutions. Iavor Bojinov, Ashesh Rambachan, and I found that the senior leaders of a global firm were often too stretched to offer one-on-one mentoring to virtual workers. So we implemented a Q&A process whereby workers posed questions through a survey and leaders responded asynchronously. Senior managers at another global firm told me that they had difficulty being themselves on camera. Whereas young remote workers were “living their lives on Instagram,” their older colleagues found virtual engagement harder. The company implemented coaching sessions to make those executives more comfortable on Microsoft Teams. Another solution to the socialization problem is to host “temporary colocation events,” inviting all workers to spend a few days with colleagues in person. Prior to Covid-19, Zapier hosted two of those a year, paying for employee flights, accommodation, and food; giving teams an activities budget; and sending people home with $50 to use on a thank-you gift for their loved ones. Carly Moulton, the company’s senior communications specialist, told me, “Personally, I have made a lot of friendships with the people I travel to and from the airport with. The event managers will put us into random groups based on what time you arrive and depart. I’ve always been with people I don’t normally work with, so it’s nice to have a dedicated time when you have to make conversation.” Finally, at the USPTO, I learned another way to create camaraderie. Several WFA examiners have voluntarily created “remote communities of practice” so that a handful of them can get together periodically. A group living in North Carolina, for example, decided to schedule meetings on a golf course to socialize, discuss work, and problem-solve together. Another manager created a “virtual meal” by ordering the same pizza for delivery to the homes of all remote direct reports during a weekly team call. How can you rate and review employees you’re never physically with, particularly on “soft” but important metrics such as interpersonal skills? All-remote companies evaluate remote workers according to the quality of their work output, the quality of virtual interactions, and feedback from clients and colleagues. Zapier, for example, uses Help Scout for customer support replies; a feature of this software is that customers can submit a “happiness score” by rating the response as “great,” “OK,” or “not good.” In the spring and summer of 2020, as groups suddenly transitioned to remote work, I was asked whether managers should use software to track worker productivity and prevent shirking. I am very much opposed to this Orwellian approach. The USPTO addressed claims of “examiner fraud” and “attendance abuse” in its WFA program following a review by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Office of the Inspector General. Those claims involved either overreporting of hours worked or shifts in the time logs of completed work, such as backloading at the end of a calendar quarter—neither of which related to the metric on which performance was measured: the number of patents examined. Nevertheless, from then on, all USPTO teleworkers had to use organizational IT tools, such as logging in to a virtual private network (VPN), having a presence indicator turned on, and using the same messaging services. But when we compared data from before and after that intervention, we found that it had no effect on average output. How to set compensation for workers who work from anywhere is an active and interesting debate. As mentioned, it’s a benefit to be able to reside in a lower-cost-of-living locale while earning the income one would in a more expensive one. But that’s conditional on the company’s not adjusting wages according to where a worker lives, as was the case at the USPTO. Matt Mullenweg, the founder of Automattic (parent of WordPress), another all-remote company, told me that its policy is to pay the same wages for the same roles, regardless of location. But GitLab and other companies do have different pay for different geographies, taking into account the experience of the worker, the contract type, and the task being performed. Although research is needed on which approach is optimal, it’s possible that companies that tie wages to location will lose high-quality WFA workers to rivals that don’t. Another pertinent issue is whether to pay WFA workers in the currency of the country where the organization is incorporated or the local one, in part to ensure consistent wages across locations over time given exchange-rate fluctuations. Several managers told me that cybersecurity was a big area of focus for WFA programs and organizations. “What if the WFA worker takes photographs of client data screens and sends them to a competitor?” one asked. The CIOs of some companies with remote-work policies said another key concern was employees’ use of personal, less-protected devices for work at home. It’s true that all-remote companies have to work harder to protect employee, corporate, and customer data. As TCS transitions to a majority-remote model, it has moved from “perimeter-based security” (whereby the IT team attempts to secure every device) to “transaction-based security” (whereby machine learning algorithms analyze any abnormal activities on any employee laptop). MobSquad has replicated its client security infrastructure for WFA workers, and employees work on clients’ cloud, email, and hardware in its offices for security reasons. All-remote and majority-remote organizations I have studied are experimenting with a wide range of solutions to protect client data using predictive analytics, data visualization, and computer vision. Transitioning to an all-remote or a majority-remote organization sometimes requires jumping regulatory hurdles as well. At the onset of the pandemic, when TCS was forced to become all-remote, it had to work with NASSCOM (India’s National Association of Software and Service Companies) and the Indian authorities to change laws overnight so that call center staffers could work from home. Other laws had to be tweaked so that TCS workers could take laptops and other equipment out of physical offices located in India’s “special economic zones.” Irfhan Rawji, the founder and CEO of MobSquad, had to work closely with the Canadian government to ensure that the economic migrants chosen by the company to move to Canada could receive their expedited work permits and be integrated into its model. Any all-remote organization thinking about hiring talent globally has to consider local labor laws as they relate to hiring, compensation, pensions, vacation, and sick leave. Of course, WFA may not be possible at this time for some organizations, such as manufacturing companies—though that could change with advances in 3D printing, automation, digital twins, and other technologies. However, with the right strategy, organizational processes, technologies, and—most important—leadership, many more companies, teams, and functions than one might have thought could go all or mostly remote. My ongoing research with Jan Bena and David Rowat suggests, for example, that start-up knowledge-work companies, particularly in the tech sector, are well positioned to adopt a WFA model from their inception. Take the all-remote eXp Realty: We found that lower real estate, utility, and other overhead costs may mean a higher valuation for the company if and when its founders exit the start-up. My studies of the USPTO and TCS indicate that large and mature organizations, too, can successfully transition to a hybrid or a majority-remote regime. The question is not whether work from anywhere is possible but what is needed to make it possible. The short answer: management. “If all senior leaders are working from an office, then workers would be drawn to that location to get face time,” one all-remote middle manager told me. But if leaders support synchronous and asynchronous communication, brainstorming, and problem-solving; lead initiatives to codify knowledge online; encourage virtual socialization, team building, and mentoring; invest in and enforce data security; work with government stakeholders to ensure regulatory compliance; and set an example by becoming WFA employees themselves, all-remote organizations may indeed emerge as the future of work."
"67",67,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/helping-low-income-workers-stay-out-of-debt","managing people.txt","Stagnant wages, a rising cost of living, and increasingly irregular schedules routinely force many working Americans onto a financial knife’s edge; they’re able to pay their usual bills but lack a buffer to handle even small financial shocks. Part of the problem is that most U.S. workers are paid biweekly, and it can take as much as a week for a paycheck to clear, making the wait for compensation even longer. In addition, many workers lack the credit scores to qualify for standard market-rate loans. So to make ends meet or cover unexpected bills, they often rely on payday loans, auto-title loans, and bank overdrafts—high-cost instruments that may push them further toward financial ruin. Economic downturns, such as today’s pandemic-related recession, only increase dependence on these services.   A study conducted at the Harvard Kennedy School explores how innovative fintech products can disrupt this damaging cycle and benefit employees and employers alike. The researchers studied two start-ups that partner with employers to make new financial offerings available as part of employees’ benefits packages. PayActiv advances wages that workers have accrued but haven’t yet received. Sometimes operating in conjunction with payroll companies such as ADP, it serves employees of FedEx, Pizza Hut, and Wendy’s, among others. Salary Finance goes a step further, offering employees low-cost loans that are automatically repaid through paycheck deductions. Based in the UK, it has expanded to the United States, where clients include the United Way and Tesla. The innovation fueling both business models is the “salary link”—the provider’s ability to directly access wages to ensure repayment of advances or loans. PayActiv applies algorithms to time and attendance data supplied by the employer, adjusting for schedules, tips, and so on, to accurately determine how much an employee has earned at any given point between paychecks. “PayActiv essentially takes on zero risk, as it’s only advancing earned wages,” says Todd Baker, one of the study’s coauthors and now a senior fellow at Columbia’s business and law schools. The firm charges $5 for each pay period in which the service is used (employers often pick up part or all of the fee). Salary Finance offers loans to partner company employees as long as they are 18 or older, have worked at the company for a year or more, and make at least $10,000 annually. Rather than rigidly applying third-party credit scores, it uses its own estimation of repayment probability to gauge an employee’s ability to afford the requested loan. The interest charged—as of this writing, rates range from 5.9% to 19.9%—does not change if the employee leaves the company; in that case, loan payments are drawn from the borrower’s personal bank account designated during the application process. “Salary Finance’s exposure is dramatically lowered because its automatic deduction turns an employee’s salary into de facto collateral,” Baker says. Indeed, the researchers found that the firm had a default rate just a fifth of that which would be predicted by credit-scoring models. Do the offerings make a difference to the workers they serve? To find out, Baker and his research partner—Snigdha Kumar, a former Harvard Kennedy School student now working at the fintech start-up Digit—compared the start-ups’ fees with those of market equivalents. Proving PayActiv’s advantage was straightforward; the $5 fee is well below the typical $35 overdraft fee charged by banks and the $30 most payday lenders charge for a two-week $200 loan. To evaluate Salary Finance’s impact, the researchers first compared the annualized interest rate charged by the firm with those of several personal-loan lenders. Salary Finance’s was considerably lower—it averaged just 11.8%, versus 21.9% to 71% among the conventional lenders assessed. But that’s only half the story, as an analysis of users in the UK showed. The typical Salary Finance loan goes to borrowers with very bad credit (the equivalent of a U.S. FICO score of 480 to 500). Americans with such poor ratings usually don’t qualify for personal loans; they often have to resort to payday-type loans, whose annualized interest rates generally exceed 200%. Salary Finance also reports the payment history on its loans to credit agencies, enabling “credit-damaged or credit-invisible employees [to] use these products not only to access credit but to eventually reenter the mainstream financial world,” Kumar says. “That was our most exciting finding; it’s life-changing.” Baker and Kumar then set out to determine whether companies also benefited. They hypothesized that the offerings would raise employee productivity, by reducing distractions caused by financial worries, and lower employer costs, by stemming the health care expenses associated with stress-related illnesses. Proving or disproving that turned out to be infeasible with the available data. But an analysis of the employment histories on 1,707 employees at 16 companies that had adopted one or the other of the offerings yielded some interesting findings. For example, in companies partnering with Salary Finance, turnover was 28% lower among active users than an analysis of previous years’ retention data would suggest. As for PayActiv, turnover was 19% lower among active users than among employees who enrolled but used the offering once or not at all. Jaime Donnelly is the chief financial officer of Integrity Staffing Solutions, which provides temporary workers and recruiting services to large online retailers across the United States. She recently spoke with HBR about the company’s partnership with PayActiv to offer workers early access to earned wages. Edited excerpts follow. Why did your company decide to provide this benefit? We have a program called Project Home, in which we train our staff to recognize the signs of homelessness among applicants and associates we have placed. Through it we learned that many workers who end up homeless are using high-cost payday lenders to handle unexpected expenses. We wanted to break that vicious cycle, but we couldn’t find a good solution in-house. Then we learned about fintech start-ups that focus on earned-wage access and decided to partner with PayActiv. Why not just offer instant pay? Mostly it was a cash-flow issue: We pay the associates we’ve placed and then bill our clients, who don’t pay us for another 30 days. Also, many states have laws designed to prevent employers from becoming lenders. What results have you seen? Our primary goal was to help our associates avoid financial distress. We also hoped that with this help, they would stay in their assignments longer, decreasing turnover for our clients. Since partnering with PayActiv a little over a year ago, we’ve seen an uptick in attendance and a decrease in attrition. It’s hard to prove causation—during this time, wages have gone up around the country, including for our associates. But we are pleased with the program. Roughly 30% of our associates have signed up for the PayActiv app—we pay somewhere between 5,000 and 25,000 employees in a given week—and some $12 million in early wages have been accessed through the program. If a company needs to offer a service like this, is it not paying people enough? The majority of our clients pay $15 to $17 per hour for entry-level positions, and some pay $20 or more per hour. Regardless of your wage, unexpected things come up—the car breaks down, or the furnace goes out—and sometimes a living wage can’t provide enough savings for those emergencies. Many times, people just haven’t made the conscious decision to save. We have seen earners of all levels need assistance with unexpected expenses. That’s why we felt a holistic solution was important. PayActiv also offers financial counseling and budgeting tools along with a savings program to help associates get better control of their financial health. What lessons can you share? It’s important to do your research. Some fintech vendors teeter on the edge of being predatory lenders themselves: They charge exorbitant fees each time an employee accesses earned wages or put a time limit on when employees can access them, which creates unnecessary pressure. You also have to make sure that the technology is accessible. Is the app available only through a laptop, or can it be used on a smartphone? Does the employee need a bank account? To service the many unbanked wage earners, PayActiv offers payment through a pay card—essentially, a preloaded Mastercard or Visa. Finally, you have to be clear about why you are doing this. We don’t earn any income from our program. It costs us time and money, but it makes a difference in the lives of our associates. High turnover is a perennial challenge for many of the large retail companies that employ low-wage workers, so the savings from such boosts in retention could be dramatic. Let’s say a retailer with 340,000 employees has a turnover rate of 50% (a conservative figure; seasonally adjusted turnover rates among U.S. retailers average about 60%). Extrapolating from meta-studies on attrition, the researchers estimated that this would cost the company some $567 million annually. A 28% reduction in turnover could thus save it close to $160 million a year—and “even a 5% reduction in turnover would be worth about $28 million,” Kumar says. To be sure, the analysis found a strong association, rather than causation, between the fintech offerings and heightened retention. It’s possible that the firms had other characteristics that induced employees to stay. Nonetheless, the researchers write, “We believe that there is enough evidence to support rapid implementation of employer-sponsored fintech benefits across corporate America.” Baker and Kumar anticipate that all pay will one day be instantaneous. Gig-economy companies such as Uber, which offer instant payment to their contractors, are changing workers’ expectations. And the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to be nudging banks to clear funds more rapidly by rolling out an instant payment service of its own, called FedNow. “These fintech tools won’t solve America’s income disparity, but they can help people on the margins who are currently being exploited by the existing financial system,” Baker says. “And it’s in employers’ interests as well—a rare win-win.”"

It was divided into business units, each with its own P&L responsibilities. Believing that conventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs laid off the general managers of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire company under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional departments of the business units into one functional organization. Although such a structure is common for small entrepreneurial firms, Apple—remarkably—retains it today, even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1997. In this article the authors discuss the innovation benefits and leadership challenges of Apple’s distinctive and ever-evolving organizational model in the belief that it may be useful for other companies competing in rapidly changing environments. Major companies competing in many industries struggle to stay abreast of rapidly changing technologies. They are typically organized into business units, each with its own set of functions. Thus the key decision makers—the unit leaders—lack a deep understanding of all the domains that answer to them. The company is organized around functions, and expertise aligns with decision rights. Leaders are cross-functionally collaborative and deeply knowledgeable about details. Apple is well known for its innovations  in hardware, software, and services. Thanks to them, it grew from some 8,000 employees and $7 billion in revenue in 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned, to 137,000 employees and $260 billion in revenue in 2019. Much less well known are the organizational design and the associated leadership model that have played a crucial role in the company’s innovation success.   When Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional structure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each with its own P&L responsibilities. General managers ran the Macintosh products group, the information appliances division, and the server products division, among others. As is often the case with decentralized business units, managers were inclined to fight with one another, over transfer prices in particular. Believing that conventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs, in his first year returning as CEO, laid off the general managers of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire company under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional departments of the business units into one functional organization. The adoption of a functional structure may have been unsurprising for a company of Apple’s size at the time. What is surprising—in fact, remarkable—is that Apple retains it today, even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1998. Senior vice presidents are in charge of functions, not products. As was the case with Jobs before him, CEO Tim Cook occupies the only position on the organizational chart where the design, engineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of Apple’s main products meet. In effect, besides the CEO, the company operates with no conventional general managers: people who control an entire process from product development through sales and are judged according to a P&L statement. Business history and organizational theory make the case that as entrepreneurial firms grow large and complex, they must shift from a functional to a multidivisional structure to align accountability and control and prevent the congestion that occurs when countless decisions flow up the org chart to the very top. Giving business unit leaders full control over key functions allows them to do what is best to meet the needs of their individual units’ customers and maximize their results, and it enables the executives overseeing them to assess their performance. As the Harvard Business School historian Alfred Chandler documented, U.S. companies such as DuPont and General Motors moved from a functional to a multidivisional structure in the early 20th century. By the latter half of the century the vast majority of large corporations had followed suit. Apple proves that this conventional approach is not necessary and that the functional structure may benefit companies facing tremendous technological change and industry upheaval. Apple’s commitment to a functional organization does not mean that its structure has remained static. As the importance of artificial intelligence and other new areas has increased, that structure has changed. Here we discuss the innovation benefits and leadership challenges of Apple’s distinctive and ever-evolving organizational model, which may be useful for individuals and companies wanting to better understand how to succeed in rapidly changing environments. Apple’s main purpose is to create products that enrich people’s daily lives. That involves not only developing entirely new product categories such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch, but also continually innovating within those categories. Perhaps no product feature better reflects Apple’s commitment to continuous innovation than the iPhone camera. When the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, Steve Jobs devoted only six seconds to its camera in the annual keynote event for unveiling new products. Since then iPhone camera technology has contributed to the photography industry with a stream of innovations: High dynamic range imaging (2010), panorama photos (2012), True Tone flash (2013), optical image stabilization (2015), the dual-lens camera (2016), portrait mode (2016), portrait lighting (2017), and night mode (2019) are but a few of the improvements. Apple leaders need deep expertise, immersion in details, and collaborative debate. To create such innovations, Apple relies on a structure that centers on functional expertise. Its fundamental belief is that those with the most expertise and experience in a domain should have decision rights for that domain. This is based on two views: First, Apple competes in markets where the rates of technological change and disruption are high, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people with deep knowledge of the technologies responsible for disruption. Long before it can get market feedback and solid market forecasts, the company must make bets about which technologies and designs are likely to succeed in smartphones, computers, and so on. Relying on technical experts rather than general managers increases the odds that those bets will pay off. Second, Apple’s commitment to offer the best possible products would be undercut if short-term profit and cost targets were the overriding criteria for judging investments and leaders. Significantly, the bonuses of senior R&D executives are based on companywide performance numbers rather than the costs of or revenue from particular products. Thus product decisions are somewhat insulated from short-term financial pressures. The finance team is not involved in the product road map meetings of engineering teams, and engineering teams are not involved in pricing decisions. We don’t mean to suggest that Apple doesn’t consider costs and revenue goals when deciding which technologies and features the company will pursue. It does, but in ways that differ from those employed by conventionally organized companies. Instead of using overall cost and price targets as fixed parameters within which to make design and engineering choices, R&D leaders are expected to weigh the benefits to users of those choices against cost considerations. In a functional organization, individual and team reputations act as a control mechanism in placing bets. A case in point is the decision to introduce the dual-lens camera with portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016. It was a big wager that the camera’s impact on users would be sufficiently great to justify its significant cost. One executive told us that Paul Hubel, a senior leader who played a central role in the portrait mode effort, was “out over his skis,” meaning that he and his team were taking a big risk: If users were unwilling to pay a premium for a phone with a more costly and better camera, the team would most likely have less credibility the next time it proposed an expensive upgrade or feature. The camera turned out to be a defining feature for the iPhone 7 Plus, and its success further enhanced the reputations of Hubel and his team. It’s easier to get the balance right between an attention to costs and the value added to the user experience when the leaders making decisions are those with deep expertise in their areas rather than general managers being held accountable primarily for meeting numerical targets. Whereas the fundamental principle of a conventional business unit structure is to align accountability and control, the fundamental principle of a functional organization is to align expertise and decision rights. Thus the link between how Apple is organized and the type of innovations it produces is clear. As Chandler famously argued, “structure follows strategy”—even though Apple doesn’t use the structure that he anticipated large multinationals would adopt. Now let’s turn to the leadership model underlying Apple’s structure. Ever since Steve Jobs implemented the functional organization, Apple’s managers at every level, from senior vice president on down, have been expected to possess three key leadership characteristics: deep expertise that allows them to meaningfully engage in all the work being done within their individual functions; immersion in the details of those functions; and a willingness to collaboratively debate other functions during collective decision-making. When managers have these attributes, decisions are made in a coordinated fashion by the people most qualified to make them. Apple is not a company where general managers oversee managers; rather, it is a company where experts lead experts. The assumption is that it’s easier to train an expert to manage well than to train a manager to be an expert. At Apple, hardware experts manage hardware, software experts software, and so on. (Deviations from this principle are rare.) This approach cascades down all levels of the organization through areas of ever-increasing specialization. Apple’s leaders believe that world-class talent wants to work for and with other world-class talent in a specialty. It’s like joining a sports team where you get to learn from and play with the best. Mikael Jansson/Trunk Archive Early on, Steve Jobs came to embrace the idea that managers at Apple should be experts in their area of management. In a 1984 interview he said, “We went through that stage in Apple where we went out and thought, Oh, we’re gonna be a big company, let’s hire professional management. We went out and hired a bunch of professional management. It didn’t work at all….They knew how to manage, but they didn’t know how to do anything. If you’re a great person, why do you want to work for somebody you can’t learn anything from? And you know what’s interesting? You know who the best managers are? They are the great individual contributors who never, ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be…because no one else is going to…do as good a job.” One current example is Roger Rosner, who heads Apple’s software application business, which includes work-productivity apps such as Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote (presentations) along with GarageBand (music composition), iMovie (movie editing), and News (an app providing news content). Rosner, who studied electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, joined Apple in 2001 as a senior engineering manager and rose to become the director of iWork applications, the vice president of productivity apps, and since 2013 the VP of applications. With his deep expertise gained from previous experience as the director of engineering at several smaller software companies, Rosner exemplifies an expert leading experts. In a functional organization, experts leading experts means that specialists create a deep bench in a given area, where they can learn from one another. For example, Apple’s more than 600 experts on camera hardware technology work in a group led by Graham Townsend, a camera expert. Because iPhones, iPads, laptops, and desktop computers all include cameras, these experts would be scattered across product lines if Apple were organized in business units. That would dilute their collective expertise, reducing their power to solve problems and generate and refine innovations. One principle that permeates Apple is “Leaders should know the details of their organization three levels down,” because that is essential for speedy and effective cross-functional decision-making at the highest levels. If managers attend a decision-making meeting without the details at their disposal, the decision must either be made without the details or postponed. Managers tell war stories about making presentations to senior leaders who drill down into cells on a spreadsheet, lines of code, or a test result on a product. Of course, the leaders of many companies insist that they and their teams are steeped in the details. But few organizations match Apple. Consider how its senior leaders pay extreme attention to the exact shape of products’ rounded corners. The standard method for rounding corners is to use an arc of a circle to connect the perpendicular sides of a rectangular object, which produces a somewhat abrupt transition from straight to curve. In contrast, Apple’s leaders insist on continuous curves, resulting in a shape known in the design community as a “squircle”: The slope starts sooner but is less abrupt. 
  An advantage of hardware products without abrupt changes in curvature is that they produce softer highlights (that is, little to no jump in light reflection along the corner). The difference is subtle, and executing on it isn’t simply a matter of a more complicated mathematical formula. It demands that Apple’s operations leaders commit to extremely precise manufacturing tolerances to produce millions of iPhones and other products with squircles. This deep immersion in detail isn’t just a concern that is pushed down to lower-level people; it is central at the leadership level.  Having leaders who are experts in their areas and can go deep into the details has profound implications for how Apple is run. Leaders can push, probe, and “smell” an issue. They know which details are important and where to focus their attention. Many people at Apple see it as liberating, even exhilarating, to work for experts, who provide better guidance and mentoring than a general manager would. Together, all can strive to do the best work of their lives in their chosen area. Apple has hundreds of specialist teams across the company, dozens of which may be needed for even one key component of a new product offering. For example, the dual-lens camera with portrait mode required the collaboration of no fewer than 40 specialist teams: silicon design, camera software, reliability engineering, motion sensor hardware, video engineering, core motion, and camera sensor design, to name just a few. How on earth does Apple develop and ship products that require such coordination? The answer is collaborative debate. Because no function is responsible for a product or a service on its own, cross-functional collaboration is crucial. When debates reach an impasse, as some inevitably do, higher-level managers weigh in as tiebreakers, including at times the CEO and the senior VPs. To do this at speed with sufficient attention to detail is challenging for even the best of leaders, making it all the more important that the company fill many senior positions from within the ranks of its VPs, who have experience in Apple’s way of operating. However, given Apple’s size and scope, even the executive team can resolve only a limited number of stalemates. The many horizontal dependencies mean that ineffective peer relationships at the VP and director levels have the potential to undermine not only particular projects but the entire company. Consequently, for people to attain and remain in a leadership position within a function, they must be highly effective collaborators. That doesn’t mean people can’t express their points of view. Leaders are expected to hold strong, well-grounded views and advocate forcefully for them, yet also be willing to change their minds when presented with evidence that others’ views are better. Doing so is not always easy, of course. A leader’s ability to be both partisan and open-minded is facilitated by two things: deep understanding of and devotion to the company’s values and common purpose, and a commitment to separating how right from how hard a particular path is so that the difficulty of executing a decision doesn’t prevent its being selected. The development of the iPhone’s portrait mode illustrates a fanatical attention to detail at the leadership level, intense collaborative debate among teams, and the power of a shared purpose to shape and ultimately resolve debates. In 2009 Hubel had the idea of developing an iPhone feature that would allow people to take portrait photos with bokeh—a Japanese term that refers to the pleasing blurring of a background—which photography experts generally consider to be of the highest quality. At that time only expensive single-lens reflex cameras could take such photos, but Hubel thought that with a dual-lens design and advanced computational-photography techniques, Apple could add the capability in the iPhone. His idea aligned well with the camera team’s stated purpose: “More people taking better images more of the time.” As the team worked to turn this idea into reality, several challenges emerged. The first attempts produced some amazing portrait pictures but also a number of “failure cases” in which the algorithm was unable to distinguish between the central object in sharp relief (a face, for instance) and the background being blurred. For example, if a person’s face was to be photographed from behind chicken wire, it was not possible to construct an algorithm that would capture the chicken wire to the side of the face with the same sharpness as the chicken wire in front of it. The wire to the side would be as blurred as the background. One might say, “Who cares about the chicken wire case? That’s exceedingly rare.” But for the team, sidestepping rare or extreme situations—what engineers call corner cases—would violate Apple’s strict engineering standard of zero “artifacts,” meaning “any undesired or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or technology.” Corner cases sparked “many tough discussions” between the camera team and other teams involved, recalls Myra Haggerty, the VP of sensor software and UX prototyping, who oversaw the firmware and algorithm teams. Sebastien Marineau-Mes, the VP to whom the camera software team ultimately reported, decided to defer the release of the feature until the following year to give the team time to better address failure cases—“a hard pill to swallow,” Hubel admits. To get some agreement on quality standards, the engineering teams invited senior design and marketing leaders to meet, figuring that they would offer a new perspective. The design leaders brought an additional artistic sensibility to the debate, asking, “What makes a beautiful portrait?” To help reassess the zero-artifacts standard, they collected images from great portrait photographers. They noted, among other things, that these photos often had blurring at the edges of a face but sharpness on the eyes. So they charged the algorithm teams with achieving the same effect. When the teams succeeded, they knew they had an acceptable standard. Another issue that emerged was the ability to preview a portrait photo with a blurred background. The camera team had designed the feature so that users could see its effect on their photos only after they had been taken, but the human interface (HI) design team pushed back, insisting that users should be able to see a “live preview” and get some guidance about how to make adjustments before taking the photo. Johnnie Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the camera team a demo. “When we saw the demo, we realized that this is what we needed to do,” Townsend told us. The members of his camera hardware team weren’t sure they could do it, but difficulty was not an acceptable excuse for failing to deliver what would clearly be a superior user experience. After months of engineering effort, a key stakeholder, the video engineering team (responsible for the low-level software that controls sensor and camera operations) found a way, and the collaboration paid off. Portrait mode was central to Apple’s marketing of the iPhone 7 Plus. It proved a major reason for users’ choosing to buy and delighting in the use of the phone. As this example shows, Apple’s collaborative debate involves people from various functions who disagree, push back, promote or reject ideas, and build on one another’s ideas to come up with the best solutions. It requires open-mindedness from senior leaders. It also requires those leaders to inspire, prod, or influence colleagues in other areas to contribute toward achieving their goals. While Townsend is accountable for how great the camera is, he needed dozens of other teams—each of which had a long list of its own commitments—to contribute their time and effort to the portrait mode project. At Apple that’s known as accountability without control: You’re accountable for making the project succeed even though you don’t control all the other teams. This process can be messy yet produce great results. “Good mess” happens when various teams work with a shared purpose, as in the case of the portrait mode project. “Bad mess” occurs when teams push their own agendas ahead of common goals. Those who become associated with bad mess and don’t or can’t change their behavior are removed from leadership positions, if not from Apple altogether. Apple’s way of organizing has led to tremendous innovation and success over the past two decades. Yet it has not been without challenges, especially with revenues and head count having exploded since 2008. As the company has grown, entering new markets and moving into new technologies, its functional structure and leadership model have had to evolve. Deciding how to organize areas of expertise to best enable collaboration and rapid decision-making has been an important responsibility of the CEO. The adjustments Tim Cook has implemented in recent years include dividing the hardware function into hardware engineering and hardware technologies; adding artificial intelligence and machine learning as a functional area; and moving human interface out of software to merge it with industrial design, creating an integrated design function. Another challenge posed by organizational growth is the pressure it imposes on the several hundred VPs and directors below the executive team. If Apple were to cap the size or scope of a senior leader’s organization to limit the number and breadth of details that the leader is expected to own, the company would need to hugely expand the number of senior leaders, making the kind of collaboration that has worked so well impossible to preserve. Cognizant of this problem, Apple has been quite disciplined about limiting the number of senior positions to minimize how many leaders must be involved in any cross-functional activity. In 2006, the year before the iPhone’s launch, the company had some 17,000 employees; by 2019 that number had grown more than eightfold, to 137,000. Meanwhile, the number of VPs approximately doubled, from 50 to 96. The inevitable result is that senior leaders head larger and more diverse teams of experts, meaning more details to oversee and new areas of responsibility that fall outside their core expertise. In response, many Apple managers over the past five years or so have been evolving the leadership approach described above: experts leading experts, immersion in the details, and collaborative debate. We have codified these adaptions in what we call the discretionary leadership model, which we have incorporated into a new educational program for Apple’s VPs and directors. Its purpose is to address the challenge of getting this leadership approach to drive innovation in all areas of the company, not just product development, at an ever-greater scale. When Apple was smaller, it may have been reasonable to expect leaders to be experts on and immersed in the details of pretty much everything going on in their organizations. However, they now need to exercise greater discretion regarding where and how they spend their time and efforts. They must decide which activities demand their full attention to detail because those activities create the most value for Apple. Some of those will fall within their existing core expertise (what they still need to own), and some will require them to learn new areas of expertise. Activities that require less attention from the leader can be pushed down to others (and the leaders will either teach others or delegate in cases where they aren’t experts). Rosner, the VP of applications, provides a good example. Like many other Apple managers, he has had to contend with three challenges arising from Apple’s tremendous growth. First, the size of his function has exploded over the past decade in terms of both head count (from 150 to about 1,000) and the number of projects under way at any given time. Clearly, he cannot dive into all the details of all those projects. Second, the scope of his portfolio has widened: Over the past 10 years he has assumed responsibility for new applications, including News, Clips (video editing), Books, and Final Cut Pro (advanced video editing). Although apps are his core area of expertise, some aspects of these—among them editorial content for News, how book publishing works, and video editing—involve matters in which Rosner is not an expert. Finally, as Apple’s product portfolio and number of projects have expanded, even more coordination with other functions is required, increasing the complexity of collaborating across the many units. For instance, whereas Rosner is responsible for the engineering side of News, other managers oversee the operating system on which it depends, the content, and the business relationships with content creators (such as the New York Times) and advertisers. To cope, Rosner has adapted his role. As an expert who leads other experts, he had been immersed in details—especially those concerning the top-level aspects of software applications and their architecture that affect how users engage with the software. He also collaborated with managers across the company in projects that involved those areas. But with the expansion of his responsibilities, he has moved some things from his owning box—including traditional productivity apps such as Keynote and Pages—into his teaching box. 
  Now he guides and gives feedback to other team members so that they can develop software applications according to Apple’s norms. Being a teacher doesn’t mean that Rosner gives instruction at a whiteboard; rather, he offers strong, often passionate critiques of his team’s work. (Clearly, general managers without his core expertise would find it difficult to teach what they don’t know.)  The second challenge for Rosner involved the addition of activities beyond his original expertise. Six years ago he was given responsibility for the engineering and design of News. Consequently, he had to learn about publishing news content via an app—to understand news publications, digital advertising, machine learning to personalize news content, architecting for privacy, and how to incentivize publishers. Thus some of his work fell into the learning box. Here managers face a steep learning curve to acquire new skills. Given how demanding this is, only critical new activities should fall into this category. Over six years of intense learning, Rosner has mastered some of these areas, which are now in his owning box. As long as a particular activity remains in the learning box, leaders must adopt a beginner’s mindset, questioning subordinates in a way that suggests they don’t already know the answer (because they don’t). This differs starkly from the way leaders question subordinates about activities in the owning and teaching boxes. Finally, Rosner has delegated some areas—including iMovie and GarageBand, in which he is not an expert—to people with the requisite capabilities. For activities in the delegating box, he assembles teams, agrees on objectives, monitors and reviews progress, and holds the teams accountable: the stuff of general management. Whereas Apple’s VPs spend most of their time in the owning and learning boxes, general managers at other companies tend to spend most of their time in the delegating box. Rosner estimates that he spends about 40% of his time on activities he owns (including collaboration with others in a given area), about 30% on learning, about 15% on teaching, and about 15% on delegating. These numbers vary by manager, of course, depending on their business and the needs at a given time. The discretionary leadership model preserves the fundamental principle of an effective functional organization at scale—aligning expertise and decision rights. Apple can effectively move into new areas when leaders like Rosner take on new responsibilities outside their original expertise, and teams can grow in size when leaders teach others their craft and delegate work. We believe that Apple will continue to innovate and prosper by being organized this way. Apple’s functional organization is rare, if not unique, among very large companies. It flies in the face of prevailing management theory that companies should be reorganized into divisions and business units as they become large. But something vital gets lost in a shift to business units: the alignment of decision rights with expertise. Why do companies so often cling to having general managers in charge of business units? One reason, we believe, is that making the change is difficult. It entails overcoming inertia, reallocating power among managers, changing an individual-oriented incentive system, and learning new ways of collaborating. That is daunting when a company already faces huge external challenges. An intermediate step may be to cultivate the experts-leading-experts model even within a business unit structure. For example, when filling the next senior management role, pick someone with deep expertise in that area as opposed to someone who might make the best general manager. But a full-fledged transformation requires that leaders also transition to a functional organization. Apple’s track record proves that the rewards may justify the risks. Its approach can produce extraordinary results."
"69",69,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/rethinking-the-on-demand-workforce","managing people.txt","As companies struggle with chronic skills shortages and changing labor demographics, a new generation of talent platforms, offering on-demand access to highly trained workers, has begun to help. These platforms include marketplaces for premium expertise (such as Toptal and Catalant), for freelance workers (Upwork and 99designs), and for crowdsourcing innovation (Kaggle and InnoCentive). Almost all Fortune 500 firms use such platforms. But most do so in an ad hoc, inefficient way, according to a Harvard Business School/BCG study. Companies need to get much more strategic about their engagement with talent platforms and fully embrace their ability to increase labor force flexibility, speed time to market, and facilitate business model innovation. That will require rewiring policies and processes and redefining working norms. Most important, leaders must inspire the cultural shift needed to realize the platforms’ transformative potential. Thanks to rapid automation, digital transformation, and demographic change, it’s harder than ever for companies to find people with the right skills at the right time. Digital talent platforms now offer companies on-demand access to highly skilled workers. Almost all Fortune 500 companies make use of these platforms, but mainly on an ad hoc basis. The process is costly, inefficient, and decidedly not strategic. In newly strategic ways, companies need to embrace the full potential of digital talent platforms and the on-demand workforce. Doing so will allow them to create new business models and unlock new sources of value. In this era of chronic skills shortages,  rapid automation, and digital transformation, companies are confronting a growing talent problem, one that has the potential to become a strategic bottleneck. How can they find people with the right skills to do the right work at just the right time? The half-life of skills is shrinking fast, and many jobs now come and go in a matter of years. Not only that, but major demographic changes are under way: Boomers are aging out of the workforce, and Millennials and Gen Z are taking over, bringing with them very different priorities about who should do what work—and where, when, and how it should get done.   To help companies address these challenges, a new generation of talent platforms—such as Catalant, InnoCentive, Kaggle, Toptal, and Upwork—has emerged. In contrast to Uber, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and TaskRabbit, these platforms offer on-demand access to highly skilled workers, and our research shows that their number has risen substantially since 2009, from roughly 80 to more than 330. Much of that growth took place during the past five years alone. Today almost all Fortune 500 companies use one or more of them. Platforms that provide workers who have four-year college degrees or advanced degrees represent an increasingly important but understudied element of the emerging gig economy. To better understand this phenomenon, we undertook a survey of nearly 700 U.S. businesses that use them. We then conducted in-depth interviews with many corporate leaders whose companies are relying on the platforms and with platform founders and executives. That companies are leveraging high-skills platforms in large numbers came as no surprise to us, because in recent years we’ve seen how they can increase labor force flexibility, accelerate time to market, and enable innovation. We were impressed, however, by the variety of engagements that companies are making with the platforms. They’re seeking help with projects that are short- and long-term, tactical and strategic, specialized and general. What’s more, 90% of the leaders we surveyed—C-suite and frontline—believe these platforms will be core to their ability to compete in the future. But here’s what did surprise us: Despite the extent to which companies are now turning to such platforms, very few firms have developed a cohesive organization-wide approach to their use. Instead, operational frontline leaders who are desperate to get things done have been reaching out to them on an ad hoc basis, often without any central guidance. This approach is costly, inefficient, and opaque. To compete in the years ahead, companies must do better. They’ll have to acknowledge and embrace the full potential of digital talent platforms—which is to say, figure out how to engage strategically with what you might call the on-demand workforce. Though millions of workers were laid off this past spring, in the coming months employers will begin to rehire—and when they do, they’ll need to be more purposeful about their approach to talent. How can they access hard-to-find expertise? Which positions or roles have changed, and what new capabilities are required? What work can be done more successfully and efficiently by skilled freelancers? In an environment of ongoing uncertainty, employers will be even more attracted to the freelance route for a variety of reasons: It makes hiring easier for hard-to-fill jobs, offers access to a wider set of skills, reduces head count, and allows more flexibility during times of change. In this article we’ll take stock of where most companies now stand on this front. We’ll show how some pioneers are speeding ahead to take advantage of what the new talent platforms have to offer, and we’ll explain how you and your management team can do the same. As the gig economy has grown, three kinds of platforms have emerged: These platforms, which include Toptal and Catalant, allow companies to easily source high-end niche experts—anybody from big-data scientists to strategic project managers and even interim CEOs and CFOs. Toptal, for example, claims it culls the “top 3%” of freelancers from across the globe. Experts might be hired for strategic initiatives or embedded in teams, and the projects they’re assigned to can range in length from a few hours to more than a year. The Covid-19 crisis is increasingly turning companies toward this kind of platform: Consider that this past spring Catalant reported a 250% increase in demand for supply chain expertise. (Full disclosure: Coauthor Joseph Fuller is an adviser to Catalant’s board of directors.) These platforms, which include Upwork, Freelancer, and 99designs, match individuals with companies for discrete task-oriented projects—designing a logo, say, or translating a legal document. For example, when Amazon wanted to explore creating custom social-media content for its new TV shows, it tested the waters with Tongal, which connects companies to individuals with media know-how. Many freelance platforms offer access to workers from around the world with a wide variety of skills, and payment is often per completed task. Covid-19 is accelerating the move toward these platforms, too: As large swaths of society began working remotely, Upwork saw a spike in demand for digital marketing expertise from companies trying to reach consumers in their homes. These platforms, which include InnoCentive and Kaggle, allow companies to post problems among large communities of technically sophisticated users—and reach a far broader base of them than could ever be found or developed in-house. The challenges run the gamut from simple coding projects to complex engineering dilemmas. Working with the platforms, companies often create competitions and offer prizes for the best solutions. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration, for example, ran a $1.5 million competition on Kaggle to help improve the algorithms that predict threats using images from airport scanning equipment. Enel, the Italian multinational energy company, uses multiple crowdsourcing platforms to generate ideas for a host of issues: how to improve recruiting and even what to do with defunct thermal plants. And the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has turned to InnoCentive’s “solvers” to develop molecules used in genetic research and testing. Millions of well-qualified Americans today are attracted to contract work. Freelancers are now estimated to make up roughly a third of the U.S. workforce, and those who are highly skilled represent a small but growing slice of it. And for the first time since 2014, the number of freelancers who say they consider gig work to be a long-term career choice is the same as the number who consider it a temporary way to make money. Early signs suggest that Covid-19 will also speed up this shift. Much of the shift is the result of demographic changes that have been under way for four or five decades but that traditional organizations have done little to recognize or address. There are at least four key trends: Single-parent and sandwich-generation families are on the rise. Burdened with childcare and eldercare, many employees are dropping out of the workforce or struggling to manage full-time jobs. Gigs allow them the flexibility to handle their family obligations while delivering quality work. Women’s participation in the U.S. labor force has been declining steadily since 2000. Highly skilled, experienced women who take time off to have children and for other life events are finding it difficult to restart their careers or are seeing themselves get sidetracked in traditional organizations. According to a 2009 Center for Work-Life Policy survey, more than two-thirds of “highly qualified” women—that is, those with advanced degrees or high-honors BAs—who drop out of the workforce would not have done so if they’d had access to more-flexible job arrangements. Online talent platforms allow them to more smoothly reenter the workforce and advance their careers. The number of freelancers who say they consider gig work to be a long-term career choice is the same as the number who consider it a temporary way to make money. Workers who are laid off or edged out of traditional firms once they hit their fifties often find that talent platforms offer them a way to continue to use their skills and experience—while maintaining satisfying work/life balance. Given that by 2030 one in five Americans will be older than 65, talent platforms expect that experienced workers with hard-to-find skills will flock to their fold. Millennials, who are already the largest generational cohort in the workforce, tend to be tech-savvy and to prefer to work for themselves rather than for traditional organizations. They want more autonomy and control over their job security than previous generations had. In studying how talent platforms are being used, we’ve identified three areas where companies have consistently found platforms most useful: When the head of technology at the PGA, Kevin Scott, found himself frustrated by the need to constantly improve and upgrade the organization’s digital capabilities and offerings despite a lack of in-house digital talent, he partnered with Upwork to quickly engage software engineers to generate and develop promising ideas. Using Upwork, the PGA was able to get projects started and finished considerably faster than before. Many managers have turned to talent platforms to fast-track processes, meet deliverables, and ensure outcomes. When Anheuser-Busch InBev wanted to quickly expand into new, disruptive products, it realized that despite having a workforce of 150,000, it needed outside help. By tapping into Catalant, the company was able to rapidly get consumer data analyzed and find experts to help roll out products like kombucha tea and spiked seltzer. Similarly, when Matt Collier, a senior director at Prudential PLC, was on a tight deadline to overhaul the training given to insurance agents in Singapore, he turned to Toptal to find designers and other talent that could help him create course materials quickly—and ended up getting the job done for less than it would have cost with traditional vendors. Digital talent platforms can also help companies reinvent the way they deliver value. In 2015, when Enel made the strategic choice to embrace the United Nations’ 2030 sustainable development goals and build new businesses around them, it engaged the services of several crowdsourcing platforms, among them InnoCentive, which alone gave Enel access to more than 400,000 of its highly skilled problem-solvers worldwide. In our survey, C-suite executives in particular seemed to envision a future reliance on talent platforms: Half thought it “highly possible” that their core workforce (permanent full-time employees) would be much smaller in the years to come, and two-thirds told us they expected to increasingly “rent,” “borrow,” or “share” talent to meet specialized needs. Why, then, have so few companies designed strategic approaches to working with talent platforms? Because the structures and processes that most organizations have in place have been designed expressly to protect them from external vendors, much as white blood cells protect our bodies from pathogens. If companies want to work successfully with digital platforms, they need new structures and processes that function as immunosuppressants. That’s a major change, and many vice presidents and directors are worried about the practical implications of embracing it. Integrating an on-demand workforce into a firm’s strategic core, they recognize, means questioning and redesigning every aspect of the organization. For managers already in the throes of a digital transformation, the prospect of taking on another massive project is hardly appealing. To get the most out of talent platforms, companies need to break work down into rigorously defined components that can be easily handed over to outsiders. Managers can’t be vague. But a digital transformation requires a talent transformation. The two go hand in hand. Company leaders understand this. Nearly two-thirds of our survey respondents reported that “understanding the digital skills needed for the future” had been a top priority for them in the previous three years. The very nature of work changes with more technology and automation, as does a company’s ability to find the skills needed to do that work. Online talent platforms provide a way to develop that ability rapidly and with much less effort. To engage with the on-demand workforce at a strategic level, companies will need to focus on five main challenges: When a company decides to turn core functions over to freelance workers, permanent employees often feel threatened. They struggle with sharing information, raise doubts about the values and work habits of outsiders, and assume the worst. That’s what happened when NASA began using crowdsourcing platforms to generate innovative ideas: The organization’s engineers began to worry about their job security and question their professional identities. As one employee put it, his colleagues were not used to saying, “Hey, we have a problem and we don’t know how to solve it. Can you help?” Often, the strongest opposition comes from employees who have the least exposure to high-skills talent platforms. The members of Enel’s leadership team saw this when they decided to seek external innovation help. Pushback came not just from the rank and file but also from senior leaders who were nervous about the message this approach would send. Was turning to freelancers a sign of weakness? Did it signal that the leadership team lacked confidence in the permanent staff? But with some careful attention to cultural change, the company managed to overcome that resistance. Instead of allowing employees to fear the unknown, Enel focused on educating employees about how they could benefit from an on-demand workforce. According to Ernesto Ciorra, the company’s chief “innovability” officer, the first step was to help all full-timers understand that they could use talent platforms to tap a powerful new source of strength. (“Innovability” is Enel’s term for innovation plus sustainability.) “We had to become humbler,” Ciorra told us, noting how important it was to recognize that at times “the best ideas lay outside the company.” Companies need to get employees to see how they personally can benefit from talent platforms. That’s what one private equity firm did when it rolled out plans to collaborate with Upwork. According to Hayden Brown, Upwork’s CEO, the message the firm sent its employees was “This is a way to help you. There are a lot of things that you may be doing in your day-to-day work that you can offload so that you can do even higher-order work or free yourself up to do more strategic thinking.” Paul Wearing However, as more teams include full-time and gig employees, working norms will have to change. Full-time employees will often need to step into coach and “connector” roles—asking questions of outside colleagues, identifying discrete pieces of work for external partners, and making it possible for gig workers to tap institutional knowledge. Full-time and gig employees will also have to learn how to work productively across dispersed, often remote teams. They’ll have to become adept at collaborating with a revolving set of teammates, articulating previously tacit team norms, and making progress easy for everybody to track. Companies will have to base promotion incentives for managers on outcomes attained rather than full-time employees overseen. Some talent platforms have already created tools—available through their enterprise agreements—that can help companies with these sorts of transitions. One of the biggest predictors of whether a company will get the most out of a talent-platform partnership is how well it can break work down into rigorously defined components that can be easily handed over to outsiders. Most companies haven’t focused on this, because in traditional workplaces, managers can afford to be vague when making assignments. They know that everybody on the project team will be interacting so frequently that they’ll be able to clarify goals and make course corrections over time. But when companies use talent platforms, they have to provide much more up-front definition. Enel learned this lesson quickly when it adopted its open-innovation approach. As Ciorra told us, “You can’t just say, ‘I need something useful for my renewable-energy problem.’ Instead, you have to be specific: ‘I need to reduce the usage of X when I do Y in Z context.’” Only after employees started providing this kind of clarity in crowdsourcing appeals did the company begin getting the help it needed. To engage strategically with talent platforms, companies need to develop a portfolio approach to skills. The first step is to understand which capabilities they have in-house, of course. Unilever uses the services of a company called Degreed, which allows employees to develop and certify their expertise in specific areas with so-called microcredentials. The employees get recognition for their know-how and understand exactly which skills they need to acquire to advance; the company benefits because it can now identify which skills the organization already has and who possesses them. Once the company has mapped internal capabilities, it can prepare for step two: striking the right balance when dividing work up internally and externally. That’s something Royal Dutch Shell tackled after identifying an urgent need to generate new revenue through digital and services growth. Using a cloud-based platform called Opportunity Hub that it already had in place, Shell was quickly able to assess the areas where it had the talent to speed toward its strategic goals and where it lacked the right skills. Soon it realized that it had shortfalls in key areas such as digitization and the internet of things—and that it didn’t have the time to find and hire the right people. To get working immediately on projects in these areas, Shell partnered with Catalant. This can be surprisingly difficult, as Collier discovered when he tried to bring in Toptal to help Prudential revamp thousands of training slides. A new mindset and a different way of working were necessary. “To adapt our initial contract for freelancers,” Collier told us, “we had to navigate a number of necessary processes, including due diligence, intellectual property, technology risk, antibribery, even anti-money-laundering.” To get the talent he urgently needed, Collier positioned working with Toptal as an experiment and persuaded stakeholders to give it a try. That paid off. Today, Prudential has a standard service agreement with the platform, and Collier readily leverages it for design and other types of skilled work. A major challenge for companies that want to harness the on-demand workforce is that they’re still subject to regulations and practices that evolved in the predigital era. At Unilever, for example, one struggle was figuring out how to pay freelancers from digital platforms. According to Adfer Muzaffar, a former Unilever senior manager for talent and learning, “Freelancers are accustomed to immediate payment on the platforms via a credit card. But we had longer payment terms, and credit card payment was not an option. We wanted to be able to track who we paid, what we were paying for, what was the quality of work, whether the rates offered were competitive compared to our local costs. So we had to find solutions so that our internal mechanisms and processes could support this new way of working.” Talent transformations are often easier than they might seem. That’s because many companies have people on staff who already have a wealth of experience with talent platforms—the managers who have used them on an ad hoc basis. These people can provide valuable guidance. Ultimately, however, to bring about change on the scale needed to innovate new business models, companies will have to appoint a leader to explore how online workforce platforms can unlock new sources of value. This has to be somebody from the C-suite. It might be the CTO, the CMO, the CFO, or the CHRO—we’ve seen successful examples of each. In the end, of course, it’s not titles that matter. It’s finding leaders who understand their companies’ strategic positioning, who recognize the revolutionary potential of engaging with the on-demand workforce, and who can inspire a cultural shift in their organizations that will make a genuine transformation possible."
"70",70,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/managing-risk-and-resilience","managing people.txt","You’ve probably heard business leaders justify their  flat-footedness in a crisis by claiming that every organization is flying blind in times of deep uncertainty. But in fact some leaders know precisely where they’re going. They understand what’s required to chart a course through market turbulence, and they’ve built organizations with keen situational awareness. When it comes to developing the ability to figure out where things are heading and respond nimbly to a changing environment, nothing is more important than analytics. Unfortunately, in recent years analytics (also known as data mining or business intelligence) has become the unloved stepchild of data sciences, overshadowed by machine learning and statistics. Those two disciplines layer mathematical sophistication on top of a foundation of human intuition, creating an appealing illusion of objectivity and deft steering. Ironically, of the three, analytics is the most essential competency for navigating crises. Solutions based on AI and machine learning hum along well during stable times but fall apart when disaster strikes. These technologies automate tasks by extracting patterns from data and turning them into instructions. Such models can quickly become obsolete when the inputs to the system change. Analytics, in contrast, alerts you when the rules of the game are changing. Without that kind of a warning, automation solutions can quickly go off the rails, leaving you exposed to exogenous shocks. Statistics has a similar shortcoming during a crisis. Statisticians help decision-makers get rigorous answers. But what if they’re asking the wrong questions? While statistical skills are required to test hypotheses, analysts have the acumen to come up with the right hypotheses in the first place. To attempt statistics without analytics, you’d need great confidence in your assumptions—the kind of confidence that’s foolhardy when a crisis pulls the rug out from under you. Analysts thrive in ambiguity. Their talent is exploration, which makes them particularly good at foreseeing and responding to crises. By searching internal and external data sources for critical information, analysts keep a finger on the pulse of what’s going on. They scan the horizon for trends and formulate questions about what’s behind them. Their job is to inspire executives with thought-provoking yet qualified possibilities. Once the highest-priority hypotheses have been short-listed by leaders, then it’s time to call in a statistician to pressure-test them and separate true insights from red herrings. During good times, leading organizations build analytics capabilities to strengthen their ability to innovate. Analysts’ ability to find clues to such things as shifting consumer tastes can help firms take advantage of opportunities before less-savvy competitors do. When the going gets tough, however, what looked like a nice-to-have innovation booster turns into a must-have safety net. To be sure, some events are impossible to see in advance—the true black swans—but addressing their fallout is a game best played with open eyes. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to cobble together a mature analytics department on short notice. The technical skills that allow analysts to guzzle data with lightning speed merely increase the mass of information they encounter. Spotting a gem in it takes something more. Without domain knowledge, business acumen, and strong intuition about the practical value of discoveries—as well as the communication skills to convey them to decision-makers effectively—analysts will struggle to be useful. It takes time for them to learn to judge what’s important in addition to what’s interesting. You can’t expect them to be an instant solution to charting a course through your latest crisis. Instead, see them as an investment in your future nimbleness. It also takes time to secure access to the promising data sources analysts need. Ideally, business leaders won’t wait for a big disruption to begin building relationships with data vendors, industry partners, and data collection specialists. Bear in mind that in the face of an extreme shock, your historical data sources may become obsolete. If your understanding of the past fails to give you a useful window on tomorrow’s world—perhaps because a pandemic has changed everything—it doesn’t matter how good your information was yesterday. You need new information. After the 2008 financial crash, for example, banks around the world recognized that there might be an advantage to analyzing nontraditional signals of creditworthiness, such as data from supermarket loyalty cards, but not all players were equally positioned to get access to them. James Day/Gallery Stock Additionally, your internal data stores may require special processing before analysts can mine them, so it’s worth thinking about hiring supporting data engineers. If analytics is the discipline of making data useful, then data engineering is the discipline of making data usable; it provides behind-the-scenes infrastructure that makes machine logs and colossal data stores compatible with analytics tool kits. When I began speaking at conferences about the importance of analytics, I found that convincing an audience of its value was the easy part. The mood changed when I explained the catch: Analytics is a time investment. You can’t count on getting something useful out of every foray into a data set. To succeed at exploration, your organization needs a culture of no-strings-attached analytics. As the leader, you are responsible for setting the scope (which data sources should be looked at) and the time frame (“You have two weeks to explore this database”). Then you must ensure that analysts aren’t punished for coming back empty-handed. During an extreme shock, your historical data sources may become obsolete. Then it doesn’t matter how good your information was yesterday. You need new information. Once business leaders accept that analytics represents an investment that may not immediately pay off, I hit the next stumbling block: the perception that only a large and technologically sophisticated company such as Alphabet can afford it. This is nonsense. In my experience you’re more likely to find analytics thriving in start-ups than at well-established behemoths. Start-ups naturally invest in analytics as they try to navigate a new market, with several generalists taking on a share of the exploratory work. Then as the venture grows, the culture changes. Workers are trusted less and made more accountable for return on their efforts, and overzealous management stifles opportunities for analytics to thrive. Analysts hired into this culture rarely get to enjoy the most interesting part of their work—exploration—and instead serve as human search engines and dashboard janitors. Many quit out of frustration as their potential is squandered. Creating a culture where analytics flourishes takes thoughtful leadership. As organizations grow toward incumbency, only the most visionary will have the courage to nurture a true analytics department and make sure that business leaders have access to it and are influenced by it. Industries that have been burned by a previous crisis — banking is a good example — are especially likely to invest in analytics and apply it to risk management. Becoming a leader in analytics takes a commitment to trust your analysts and give them space to do their work. Their job, after all, will be to reveal threats that you never even imagined should be on your radar. That sort of work can’t be managed with a stopwatch and a checklist. Crises such as a pandemic—when no one has the answers, and uncertainty is high—remind us of the importance of asking the right questions. Analytics gives firms an edge in learning and adapting. When the world is suddenly upended, those who can learn the fastest are best positioned to succeed. Smart companies will invest in analytics today to get ahead of whatever is coming tomorrow.  There are ordinary, predictable risks—and then there are black swan events, tsunami risks, and disasters. In this month’s Spotlight package, the experts share advice on how to deal with threats that are unexpected and overwhelming.

"71",71,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/be-a-better-ally","managing people.txt","The Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements have forced people in positions of power—namely, the white men who dominate institutional leadership roles—to realize they must personally step up to make organizations more fair and inclusive. That means playing a truly active role in helping marginalized colleagues advance (instead of just delegating diversity efforts to human resources). How can white men be effective allies to those employees? First, by taking responsibility for their own behaviors, educating themselves about racism and privilege, and getting and accepting feedback from people in underrepresented groups. They can also become confidants to and sponsors of women and people of color and insist on diverse hiring pools and practices. They can vigilantly watch out for bias at work, intervening decisively if they discover it. Last, they can work to build a community of other allies against racism and sexism. In the United States and many other parts of the world, we’re finally engaging in substantive conversations about a once untouchable issue: white male privilege. The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, as well as the systemic inequalities laid bare by the Covid-19 pandemic, have forced people in positions of power—that is, the white men who dominate leadership roles across public and private institutions—to realize that they must step up if there is to be any hope of making organizations more diverse, fair, and inclusive.   Many firms have reacted to recent events—from the revelations of workplace sexual harassment to the spate of brutality against Black Americans—with well-intended press releases and statements reaffirming commitments to social justice. Some have promised to make sizable donations to activist groups, support legal funds, do pro bono work, or create diversity task forces and speaker series. But many of these efforts lack action-oriented plans and targets. For too long, leaders from majority groups have helped preserve the status quo, which favors them, by relegating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to human resources instead of using their own power to effect change. This is in some ways understandable: Angie’s research shows that many white male leaders deny racism or avoid discussing it because those conversations feel uncomfortable or controversial. They fail to acknowledge their own privilege, insisting that they and their organizations are gender- and color-blind. Very few understand the problem and what steps they can take to be effective allies with marginalized groups. We view allyship as a strategic mechanism used by individuals to become collaborators, accomplices, and coconspirators who fight injustice and promote equity in the workplace through supportive personal relationships and public acts of sponsorship and advocacy. Allies endeavor to drive systemic improvements to workplace policies, practices, and culture. In a society where customers, employees, and investors increasingly see equity and inclusion as not just a nice-to-have but a must-have, allyship by an organization’s senior leaders has become essential. In this article we’ll describe evidence-based best practices for becoming an ally, drawing on our decades of work studying how women, people of color, and women of color advance in the workplace. (Note that many people are members of two or more marginalized groups. As other scholars have shown, it’s important to acknowledge intersectional identities and how women of color are specifically diminished within these groups.) While our advice is addressed largely to white men in the United States, we believe it can be used by members of any privileged group who want to create inclusive organizations. Our hope is that the growing attention to systemic U.S. racism and sexism will lead to a global movement toward workplace equality. Change starts with individual leaders’ taking responsibility for their own attitudes and behaviors. There are a number of ways to do this. Do your homework. It can be tempting to simply ask women, people of color, and women of color about their experiences with inequality and injustice. But that unfairly burdens them with emotional and cognitive labor. An ally takes the time to read, listen, watch, and deepen understanding first. White leaders at U.S. companies, for example, should not only study the country’s history of systemic racism and the struggles people of color face but also consider how their own behaviors have perpetuated discrimination. When you do talk to others about the obstacles they’ve faced, start by requesting their permission. If it’s granted, approach with humility and a learning mindset. Good questions include: Recognize that members of an underrepresented group won’t all have the same experiences—especially if they’re from different cohorts. For example, white women’s experiences aren’t necessarily similar to those of women of color, who, all our research shows, are particularly marginalized and silenced in organizations. Don’t generalize from the stories of one or two colleagues. Talk to many and be attuned to their unique experiences and intersectional identities. Women and people of color are often the “only” in the room, a scenario that can spur outsider and impostor feelings. Don’t rely too heavily on your own experiences, either. For example, a white male program director at Lockheed Martin had an aha moment when he told a Black woman to bring “a little swagger and attitude” to a client pitch. She quickly responded, “I can’t do that,” and she was right: She couldn’t act the way he could as a white man. Allies need that level of awareness. Finally, pay vigilant attention to how women, people of color, and women of color experience meetings and other gatherings, and stay alert to inequities and disparities. Transform your perspective as a leader. As one male executive in the global development sector reflected, “Once you put on that lens, you can’t take it off. The world never looks the same.” Being an ally requires recognizing the advantages, opportunities, resources, and power you’ve automatically been accorded as a white man while others have been overtly or subtly denied them. This can be painful because it often means admitting that you haven’t entirely earned your success. But it’s necessary. It’s also important to understand that privilege is a resource that can be deployed for good. As a white male law firm executive explained to David and Brad, “Think about the last time you made a career decision. As a man, you were probably never asked, ‘How does this decision affect your wife or kids?’ or ‘Why are you focusing on your career instead of your family?’ That would seem like a weird conversation even in the 21st century. Not so much for women.” White men are also far less likely to have to code-switch—adjust their style of speech, appearance, and behavior to fit into a particular culture and increase their chances of being hired, accepted, or promoted. This is extra work that takes an emotional toll. As one Black professional told Courtney McCluney in her research on this topic, “I find myself constantly trying to be aware of my mannerisms to ensure that I don’t portray myself or the people I represent in a negative light.” Deliberately seek feedback from marginalized groups, but recognize the power dynamics at play. If women of color, for example, are asked to give advice to white male colleagues when they themselves are not in secure positions (partner, tenured professor, and so on), the request may inadvertently add invisible labor and stress—what Tsedale calls an inclusion tax. You need to establish trusting relationships with people from marginalized groups (especially those disadvantaged in multiple ways) who will give you unvarnished feedback about your workplace conduct. Receive their comments as a gift. Even when you’re surprised or dismayed by what others tell you, show that you value candor. Be thoughtful and sincere. Appropriate responses include: Tsedale’s research shows that Black women who progressed at their law firms typically had trusting relationships with certain white male partners who took a genuine interest in their careers. So let women, people of color, and women of color know that they can confide in you about the slights, dismissals, and aggressions so often encountered in workplaces. Make yourself available, listen generously, and try to empathize with and validate their experiences. One woman of color, the president of a national trade union, explained how her white male ally did this: “What I most appreciated about him was that he always made time for me and encouraged me to stop by and see him despite how busy he was.” Women and people of color—and particularly Black women—are often the “only” in the room, a scenario that can spur outsider and impostor feelings. Allies combat this by inviting more colleagues from marginalized groups to gatherings. When meetings are set up, they ask, “Whose perspective are we missing?” When they notice they’re in a room in which everyone looks like them, they say, “Should we ask Angie or Tsedale to join? Are we including their work and expertise?” When you witness discrimination, don’t approach the victim later to offer sympathy. Give him or her your support in the moment. Especially if you have positional authority or status, you should use a “pull” approach: In meetings, ask very specific questions of people whose contributions and expertise are often overlooked or devalued, so that alpha white men and their bravado can’t hog the floor. It also helps to “decenter” yourself. In societies where racism and sexism abound, the attention in a space will often naturally go to white men. Allies learn to step out of the spotlight by, for example, asking a woman of color to lead a meeting or recommending that a person from an underrepresented group take their place in a high-visibility position or event. This is the more-taxing ally work. Vigilantly monitor your workplace for racist or sexist comments and behavior, and then be clear and decisive in shutting them down. Don’t wait for marginalized people to react, as they’re often accused of “playing the race or gender card”—a tactic used to silence women, people of color, and women of color specifically. When you witness discrimination, don’t approach the victim later to offer sympathy. Give him or her your support in the moment. Also look out for gaslighting—psychological manipulation that creates doubt in victims of sexist or racist aggression, making them question their own memory and sanity. This tactic is designed to invalidate someone’s experience. Examples include comments like these: “I’m sure he didn’t mean any harm by that. That’s just his way.” “You might be blowing this out of proportion.” “You’ll have to learn to be less sensitive.” “Can’t you take a joke?” “There are so many more important things to focus on right now.” If you hear people, whether they are other white men or white women, say something along those lines, respond, “As an organization with a commitment to equality and inclusion, we should take our colleague’s concerns seriously. We should deal with this immediately rather than wait for a more convenient time.” Intervene whether or not women, people of color, or women of color are in the room. Explain that you are offended and that such comments or actions aren’t acceptable or representative of your organization. Frame the confrontation as a learning or growth opportunity for the person and the team. Assume that your response might be questioned and have your arguments for inclusion—research on its personal, team, and organizational benefits—lined up. Finally, avoid common mistakes made by people who claim to be allies. Some people who declare themselves to be antiracists think that they’re absolved of their own biases and prejudices or do it to put themselves on a higher moral ground. Being an ally is not about making yourself look good or feel better. Allies seek out talented protégés from entirely different racial and cultural backgrounds and become their vocal fans. They get to know these colleagues’ strengths and weaknesses, help them develop as leaders, challenge and encourage them, and tout their abilities and achievements whenever new projects, stretch assignments, or promotions are discussed. They nominate protégés on the basis of their potential, without expecting them to prove they can do a job in advance. This usually requires putting some social capital on the line—a risk sponsors need to get more comfortable with. Finally, allies introduce protégés to key players in their own professional networks to open up an even broader set of opportunities for them. In Tsedale’s research, sponsorship was shown to be critical to Black women’s access to significant training, development, and networking opportunities and advancement. Unfortunately, many white men picked protégés who looked just like them. As Fotoula, a fifth-year law associate without a sponsor, noted, “I think where [the lack of mentorship] really played a role was in not having…people to say, ‘Make sure you’re at the event. Make sure you speak up and say this. Make sure that you ask about this,’ or ‘You know what? I heard about a deal that’s happening at such and such. I’m going to make sure this partner knows that you’re interested.’ I’m not saying I was entitled to it,” she continued, “but…I know that would have made a difference.” A well-established cause of pay gaps, low retention, and stalled career progression for women, people of color, and especially women of color is bias and discrimination in hiring, professional development, and promotions. White male allies can help colleagues from marginalized groups overcome this hurdle. If you’re hiring, strengthen your own processes. Insist on open job listings and targeted recruiting to avoid an overreliance on referrals, which have been shown to perpetuate workforce homogeneity. Make sure candidate pools are diverse—with at least one person and ideally many people from marginalized groups. Finally, enforce fair application reviews and committee deliberations, watching for and calling out red-flag comments such as “His résumé is really impressive,” “It sounds like she’s a busy mom,” “I’d like to see her prove she can handle this responsibility before we promote her,” and “I’m not sure she’s a good fit”—language often used to exclude women of color from opportunities. You can respond with something as simple as “Would we be having this conversation about a white man?” You can also get others to hold you accountable—for example, by involving women and people of color in the hiring process or assigning another team member to serve as a “bias interrupter.” Allies can broaden their impact by joining or forming groups of colleagues interested in fighting racism and gender inequality. Look for like-minded people in all parts of your organization, including other units, satellite and remote locations, and employee resource groups, and then grow your base. Focus your advocacy on evidence-based tactics that will drive small wins within your sphere of influence, and create opportunities to interact through networking, mentoring, and professional development events. If you’re a senior leader, you should push for organizational change. No matter where your organization is on its DEI journey, you can champion and lend time and energy to designing and implementing antibias, recruitment, and leadership development initiatives that work. Iris Bohnet has found that DEI efforts are most successful when leaders clarify their purpose and goals and are transparent about plans and progress. According to Andrew Behar, the CEO of As You Sow, companies that do this will attract and retain the best and brightest employees and reduce risk to shareholders. And we have observed that effective senior allies not only set an example but also outline expectations for everyone’s behavior and link outcomes to responsibilities and rewards. The time to do this work is now. It is because of the vocal and visible protests of women, people of color, and especially women of color that we are even able to write this article. But members of underrepresented groups need powerful white male allies too. We all have an opportunity—and a responsibility—to support change on our own teams, which will ultimately benefit our organizations and society. Tsedale M.

"72",72,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/innovation-for-impact","managing people.txt","When he was the CEO of SRI International, Curtis Carlson presided over the conception and development of Siri, HDTV, and other groundbreaking innovations. Since then he has shared his approach with more than 500 corporate, university, and government groups. His methodology is based on the principles of active learning, which emphasize concise mental models, the continual iteration of ideas, real-time feedback, teamwork, and frequent comparison of alternatives. Those elements are woven into a process that focuses on customers’ needs, a compelling approach, valuable benefits relative to costs, and superiority to the competition. Innovation in the U.S. is highly inefficient. Despite substantial investment in entrepreneurship—by the government, universities, and the private sector—the per capita rate of job creation from new companies has declined for decades. At its heart, creating value is an exercise in active learning. Unless your process reflects that, your company will probably fail to systematically develop innovations that matter. The author’s framework involves designing an “NABC value proposition” that spells out how your offering addresses customers’ needs with a compelling approach while delivering superior benefits relative to costs and reliably outdoing the competition. The methodology works because it’s based on proven practices from the education sciences. In 1998 I became the CEO of  SRI International, the famous research center that received the first internet transmission, developed the first AI-based robot, launched the personal computing revolution, and created inventions such as the computer mouse, electronic banking, and robotic surgery. In 1998, though, SRI was on its last legs. At my first off-site meeting, a manager stood up and told me we were not going to grow because we couldn’t. We were broke, our facilities urgently needed repair, and the land they sat on was being sold. Teams worked in silos, and most of the senior managers were pursuing their own agendas with little regard for what others were doing.   When I left in 2014, revenue had more than tripled, and world-changing ideas had generated tens of billions of dollars of new marketplace value. By revamping the way employees worked, using a systematic, efficient process for value creation, we reestablished SRI as one of the world’s leading innovation enterprises. The success rate of our projects dramatically improved, and our people gained critical skills that would last a lifetime. In this article I describe the process we used, which enabled us to produce technology such as HDTV and Siri (now on the iPhone). Our methodology is applicable for creating both disruptive and incremental innovations, and versions of it are used in major universities, national laboratories, and large global companies. It works for people in all positions and all professions because value creation is everyone’s job. Since leaving SRI, I have partnered with a former colleague there, Len Polizzotto, to further develop the methodology at Northeastern University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. We call our approach Innovation for Impact, and in 2017 I coauthored a National Academy of Engineering report documenting aspects of the research behind it. What sets our approach apart from others is that we consider value creation to be an exercise in active learning. Coming up with a novel product or service is not simply a matter of waiting for inspiration to strike but a process of using proven practices from the education sciences to gain insights and improve fast. Active learning depends on engagement. Students become master architects, for example, not just by reading textbooks, listening to lectures, or watching other architects but by constantly working on and revising actual projects. Through that activity, they synthesize the theory they’re taught, the techniques they see others using, and their own ability to manage the design process. People who try to learn purely through observation and theory miss a great deal and forget even more. That’s particularly true for anyone seeking to create value in business. Innovation occurs in a complex, dynamic environment; those who succeed do so because they manage to find the right signals in a sea of noise. To create efficiently and effectively in that context, people must follow a structured process that includes five basic elements of active learning: In creative endeavors, repetition is central to learning. Serious piano students, for example, continually practice complex manual maneuvers and experiment with tempo and expression. Those activities are most effective when accompanied by real-time feedback from an expert who can reframe problems and provide potential solutions. Developing a new business idea is, of course, very different from learning to play the piano. The inputs are undefined and may come from a range of sources. So instead of a master-apprentice relationship, the process involves an innovator who keeps refining the idea and seeking feedback widely: from experts, peers, partners, competitors, and, most importantly, customers. Effective feedback initially focuses on arriving at one or two key insights into customer needs and possible solutions. Psychologists assert that all of us construct “mental models”—frameworks carried in our minds to make sense of our experiences and inform our decisions. In active learning, we use these models to identify the beliefs, insights, and assumptions upon which we build hypotheses for what works. We can then test our hypotheses against collected evidence and, if warranted, revise them to develop improved models. It’s critical that the mental models that guide the initial inquiry respect the limitations of the people using them. Research shows that most of us retain only seven items, on average, in our short-term memory. What’s more, we can think about only three or four items at once. If innovators use mental models that are too long or too complicated (as many are), they will not easily make sense of the evidence or rapidly learn their way to better hypotheses. But if mental models are concise, they can, over time, become intrinsic knowledge to be tapped almost automatically. Active learning involves applying a variety of approaches to presenting and experimenting with ideas. Using images, simulations, and prototypes, for example, can bring ideas to life, highlight different aspects of a problem, and challenge people’s thinking about possible solutions. Storytelling is effective because it can create the context for a mental model: Research shows that stories help people remember information and revise their beliefs, assumptions, and theories. Working in teams increases engagement, learning, and motivation. Research suggests that the optimal size for a business team is about five people. That number allows for a diversity of perspectives and skills, is small enough to prevent the group from subdividing, and reduces communication costs and the risks of miscommunication. Because value creation is a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary activity, no individual will have all the necessary knowledge, relevant mental models, or insights. This means that each person on the team must bring the distinct competencies and experiences required for his or her tasks. The goal is to assemble teams whose members have a shared vision but complementary skills and varied viewpoints. Comparison is how we learn our preferences and decide most things, whether we’re buying a new car or choosing what to eat. And research shows that direct and rapid comparison of two similar objects greatly amplifies small differences. Suppose you need new eyeglasses. If you randomly try out different pairs, it may take a while to find one that helps you see better. So instead you get an exam in which you look into a machine that displays lenses of different strengths. Your doctor rapidly switches the lens in front of each eye, asking, “Which is better, this or the previous one?” Having you quickly compare lenses with subtle distinctions enables the doctor to swiftly zero in on the right prescription. Systematic success is achieved when all the building blocks of active learning are brought together in a complete value-creation system. Our approach focuses first on crafting a risk-mitigated value proposition for the offering you hope to bring to market. But how can you tell if you have a good proposition? I once held a workshop for one of the world’s largest companies. The 30 participants were responsible for six initiatives, which they considered to be the firm’s most important ones. I started by asking them to write on sticky notes the company’s definitions for innovation, customer value, and value proposition. After they put all their notes up on a wall, what was obvious was the lack of shared definitions for the most basic concepts of value creation—a problem that was preventing everyone from being fully effective. Palette of Marc Chagall | Photographs: ©Matthias Schaller/Courtesy Sonnabend Gallery, New York/VG Bildkunst 2020 I then gave the teams this instruction: “Write out your initiative’s value proposition on a flip chart. Tell us the customer needs, your approach for the offering, its benefits relative to its costs, and how it compares to the competition.” After half an hour, each team took two minutes to share its statement with the whole group. None was quantitative or convincing, and the teams went back to refine their presentations further. After several iterations, many of the teams found themselves questioning the merits of their initiatives. Some participants were visibly dismayed to realize that they’d been working on things that were interesting to them but of little importance to the company. This is not unusual. My partners and I have held workshops with more than 500 teams from major companies, universities, national laboratories, and government agencies. None has had shared language for the core concepts of innovation, and none has initially been able to address what we regard as the basic components of a value proposition. After we give people a framework, they typically conclude that less than a fourth of their existing projects, if completed, would provide significant value for their enterprises. Our framework is anchored in a fundamental, concise model of what a value proposition should be. We call it the NABC value proposition, and it’s described at length in my book with William Wilmot, Innovation: The Five Disciplines for Creating What Customers Want. An NABC value proposition covers four topics: The innovator’s first task is to draft a value proposition that addresses all four elements. If one is missing, the proposition is incomplete and unlikely to support value creation. The elements are interdependent, which means that altering any one of them will affect some or all of the others. For example, if the customers’ needs change, so will the benefits relative to costs, the competition, and likely the approach. The conciseness of the NABC framework is part of its power. When people use it to evaluate a proposition, they need to think about only four elements. In contrast, overly complex frameworks violate core active-learning principles: The Heilmeier Catechism, for example, poses 11 questions, and the Business Model Canvas has nine sections, each with multiple questions. At SRI we used the NABC model in defining the value proposition for Siri, which we originally conceived as a tool to help with travel arrangements. After it was spun out into a company that was acquired by Steve Jobs, Siri became a general-purpose assistant, but here’s a short version of what we told potential investors early on: People are prone to making three major mistakes in formulating value propositions. First, most people fail to pay adequate attention to their customers’ needs, which should be the foundation of the value proposition. Instead they fall in love with their idea, which means they focus almost exclusively on their approach. Over 95% of the innovation pitches I see are all about approach—a sign that the team has yet to figure out what really matters. If teams avoid this trap and make an effort to look seriously at needs, they typically make a second mistake: over-relying on what customers say they’re seeking, rather than identifying the real need. Consider the first iPhone. Apple’s surveys at the time suggested that people wanted a better keyboard. What they actually wanted was more convenience and ease of use, and that is what the iPhone’s revolutionary touchscreen delivered. Customers can ask only for what they know, and they rarely know what is possible. The third major mistake is related to the other two: It involves spending too much money on an ill-defined approach. If the value proposition is not well-defined, building a minimally viable product wastes time and money. At the start, the smallest possible team should be assembled to address the major risks in the value proposition. Until those risks are mitigated, building the offering is almost always a costly error. Value creation is a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary activity. When an NABC proposition is successful, it is usually because the people formulating it reframe the problem and focus on one or two big ideas that offer potential solutions. Today we’re all used to seeing upside-down ketchup bottles, but initially that design was startling. Bottles traditionally had narrow necks and stood upright to avoid messy leaks, but you had to tip the bottle and pound the bottom to get ketchup out, and you often wound up with more on your plate than you wanted. The solution was obvious once inventor Paul Brown realized that the challenge was not to make a standard bottle that dispensed ketchup better but to make an upside-down bottle that didn’t leak. Value creation begins when someone has an insight about how to solve an unmet need and is motivated to turn that insight into a product or service. I call these people champions because the term captures the spirit of what is required. Anyone at any level of the organization can act as a champion; no particular title or position is necessary. Champions are passionate about their initiatives and persevere. They self-select. You cannot direct people to be value creators; their drive comes from within. At SRI my first question when someone came to see me with an idea was, “Will you be the champion?” If they were new, they might ask what that meant. I would explain: “Champions identify important opportunities, drive the value proposition’s development, learn necessary value-creation skills, build the team, and exemplify positive human values. If you agree to this, let’s get started.” My fundamental rule remains the same: No champion, no project—no exceptions. Once we have an idea and a champion, I ask that person to immediately write down the NABC value proposition and to quantify it instead of using vague terms like bigger, better, faster, or cheaper. If the champion is unsure about something, my advice is “Put down your best estimate.” It will be wrong—that’s always the case at the start—but this first step helps clarify the idea, the core challenges, and the skills to look for when you’re building a team. I then ask the champion to find an “iteration buddy” to drive progress and provide emotional support. My partner for developing HDTV was Glenn Reitmeier. We iterated our value proposition hundreds of times over several years before we identified the key insights that led to the solution. As the value proposition develops, the champion will involve other colleagues, reaching out to people with the expertise to test the value proposition’s assumptions and remove its significant risks. A team will often start with a person with business skills, another with technical expertise, and others who assist part-time with market analysis, technical issues, and operations. The first goal is to minimize risks, not create the product. Value creation forums are recurring meetings where three to six teams—each with up to five members—present value propositions for their initiatives and obtain input from the other participants. A typical forum will bring together 10 to 25 people, with outside experts and partners invited as needed to help participants identify and understand the market, the competition, and the range of potential solutions. At SRI we held separate forums for different aspects of our enterprise—sustaining the core technical-services business, making strategic investments, and creating licenses and new ventures. In all cases we applied the same overall design: A facilitator organizes and moderates the forums, which take place in person or virtually over the web for one to three hours every two to six weeks, depending on the business objectives. Teams sign up to participate and start by attending a two-day workshop to learn the fundamentals of value creation, with the facilitator coaching them on roles and expectations. Once per forum, someone from each team makes an NABC presentation, describing the team’s value proposition in 10 minutes or less. Afterward, the facilitator randomly calls on individuals to answer these questions: The facilitator then asks all participants for any other observations. Finally, someone is asked to evaluate the quality of the feedback. While all this discussion takes place, the presenter stands and listens silently, as a teammate takes notes for review after the meeting. The reason is simple: Presenters may be tempted to defend their presentations rather than listen impartially to the comments, and the meeting may get bogged down in adversarial debate. Thinking about and responding to feedback is work for teams to do later. The forum process makes comparative learning easy because, as already noted, the NABC model enables participants to compare the different value propositions across just four components. And teams benefit not only from the direct feedback they get but also from seeing what other teams do. For example, imagine you work for a drone company that’s seeking to develop new products. Your team’s value proposition identifies a need for a novel drone for bird-watchers and says the overall consumer drone market generates several billion dollars in annual revenue. Other forum participants would probably comment on the lack of specificity about the need and the intended market segment. Although that feedback would be useful, you might remain unsure how to perform better at the next meeting. But suppose another team says this when it presents: “There are 20 million active bird-watchers in America who spend almost $30 billion a year on equipment. Of that total, 1% are hardcore birders who buy the latest equipment and want to capture close-up images and videos of their experiences. The top 5% of spenders in that group of enthusiasts represent a potential market of $15 million a year for ultraquiet, camouflaged, bird-watching drones.” That description of an unmet need, with its additional specificity about potential customers, makes the issues to be addressed more evident. It also sets the bar for other teams’ presentations at the next forum. This is comparative learning at work. When people repeat this process eight or more times in a two-day workshop and then participate in recurring value-creation forums, they see dramatic progress. A good forum needs a good facilitator to manage the schedule and activities, help out when teams get stumped, and add new ideas and clarifications as appropriate. Facilitators are not there to give lectures; their job is to help the teams understand and apply the concepts, reframe issues, and get feedback from their teammates. At SRI we usually put senior staff or executives in that role, choosing people with proven track records at innovation and training them in our methodology. SRI projects went forward if they showed the potential to create significant value—typically a market valuation of $100 million or more for a new venture. That magnitude was necessary to attract top talent, gain the interest of knowledgeable investors, and provide a meaningful financial return. If SRI’s criteria were not met, the project was either abandoned, redirected toward becoming a licensed technology, or rolled into another R&D initiative. At any one time, our venture portfolio consisted of about a dozen projects at various stages of development, with several commercialized each year. We initially made incremental and modest investments, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and focused on establishing the validity of the value proposition. Mid-level management funded the development work at first and then referred promising projects up the organization to gain more support. After an incubation period of up to five years, we would identify an experienced entrepreneur (usually from outside the firm) and assemble a world-class team to take the venture to market. Innovation in the United States is highly inefficient. The per capita rate of job creation from new companies has declined for decades, and only 3% of patents are ever commercialized. Most university tech-transfer and start-up incubators lose money. Venture capitalists look at more than 100 deals to invest in one, and typically less than one in 10 delivers a significant return. Most venture capital firms in fact lose money; 5% earn 95% of the returns. All this despite the efforts of some 220 university entrepreneurial programs, 6,000 professors and instructors teaching entrepreneurship, 1,400 venture incubators, and billions of dollars a year in government investments. We must do better. My experience with SRI and other organizations suggests that basing the value creation process on the principles of active learning and using the structured NABC methodology will deliver the improved innovative outcomes our economy needs and deserves.

Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. Several years ago, on a cold February morning, ABC News released a music video by Will.I.Am aimed at increasing the voter turnout for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. The video, “Yes We Can,” quickly went viral and became a rallying call for those supporting Barack Obama’s campaign. Two of my coworkers had very different reactions to the video. Emma, a New York-born Democrat, stepped into my office at the end of a long day and breathlessly described how she’d been listening to the song on repeat. It had inspired her to seriously consider quitting her job to campaign for Obama full-time. The next day, I saw another coworker, Logan, a Florida-born Republican, arguing passionately with Emma about the video. “It’s all editing and music,” he yelled. “Where’s the message of substance?” Emma rolled her eyes and walked away. At the time, I was shocked that a music video could produce such a strong, emotional argument between two of my peers. But as political divides across the world get more partisan, these kinds of conflicts are becoming more and more common. And if you’re just starting out in your career, it can be especially hard to navigate these conflicts. Maybe you haven’t had to have a serious conversation at work yet, or you’re just starting to feel comfortable at a new job. You may have even had disagreements with your coworkers over tasks, how you should respond to a client, or what next steps to take in a project. But at the end of the day, work is work, and it’s usually not personal. Political conflicts, on the other hand, are personal. They tend to challenge our values and upset our sense of emotional balance. You’ve likely heard the expressions: “The enemy of my enemy is my friend,” or “A friend of my friend is a friend.” These sayings are drawn from balance theory, which explains how mutual agreement on feelings, attitudes, and beliefs can lead to the formation of positive relationships. But the expression “a friend of my friend is a friend” doesn’t just apply to other people, it applies to social objects — like values — as well. For example, if you strongly identify as a Democrat, you may find that many of your friends are Democrats too, and vice versa. So if you find out that a coworker that you like disagrees with one of your strongly identified values, it causes a great deal of emotional tension. We know from studies of social relationships that we resolve this tension in one of two ways — either we change our values, or we change our relationships. Neither of those outcomes are desirable in the workplace, because you have to be able to work well with all kinds of people despite divergent beliefs. Assuming that we want to hold onto our core values at work and maintain good working relationships, what can we do? The answer is surprisingly simple: Have a conversation. It won’t always be easy, but rest assured, there are ways to gracefully navigate a debate about politics at work. 1) Start by listening. When our values are challenged, it is hard to resist the urge to speak out and “correct” others’ views. However, a more productive approach is to start by listening to your coworker. I don’t just mean wait for them to finish talking before you share your point of view. I mean fully exploring their point of view. Ask open questions (i.e., those that start with how, what, why). It is important to express interest, so try using phrases like: When you have explored their view, summarize what you’ve heard to check that you’ve understood them correctly. The idea here is to paraphrase what they said, not to necessarily agree with them (e.g., “Let me see if I understand. You believe…”). Listening, of course, is hard to do when your values are challenged, but taking this approach sets the tone for the rest of the conversation. By listening, you send the message that their view is valid (even if you don’t agree with it), and you build a norm for interacting that will encourage them to listen and explore your point of view in return. 2) Re-frame the issues that are important to you. Now that you’ve really listened to your coworker, you hopefully understand their values. This is essential if you ever want to change their point of view (if that is your goal). When we try to convince other people of our ideas, we often frame our arguments through the lens of our own values. But when people don’t share our beliefs, they won’t be convinced by arguments built on them. Research shows that when partisan issues are re-framed through values that opposing groups care about, those groups increase their support. This approach can work for you too. For example, Democrats and Republicans frequently disagree on military spending. Republicans have traditionally advocated for the expansion of the military, arguing that the military unifies American society and ensures the U.S. maintains its standing on the world stage. Democrats tend to disagree, seeing this justification as overly hawkish. Yet when military spending is framed as providing opportunities for social mobility for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, Democrats increase their support for military spending. 3) End on agreement. Now that you have re-framed the issue through the lens of each other’s values, explore any areas of agreement you share. For example, you might both agree that access to health care should be expanded (even if you disagree on how) and that any candidate for political office who intends to reduce access to health care is unlikely to receive either of your votes. Again, simple phrases like “It sounds like we agree on …” or “The overlap between our views is …” are all that are needed. Ending on agreement is important for restoring the sense of emotional balance you feel towards the other person and de-escalating any emotional tension between you. It is unlikely you will leave the conversation having resolved all of your differences. But by finding some point of agreement, you will leave the talk on a common ground and leave room for another collaborative conversation in the future. Remember that there is also a caveat here: Different types of political conversations can happen in the workplace. The types of conversations I’ve outlined above may make us upset and angry, but they don’t threaten our existence or comfort at work. However, other conversations can become hostile or disrespectful to you or your BIPOC or LGBTQIA colleagues. If that is the case, you should initiate a conversation with your manager or HR. On the whole, diversity of values, thought, and opinion is an essential part of today’s workplace. Engaging with people who hold deeply different views than us can spark new ideas and insights. But this potential is lost when diversity of values breeds misunderstanding and conflict. Ultimately, the responsibility for forging productive working relationships with people with different values falls to the individual, and it starts with a conversation."
"74",74,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/are-you-ready-to-be-coached","managing people.txt","Before you decide to work with an executive coach, assess your readiness to ensure you’ll actually benefit and grow from the experience. Take a look at yourself in the context of seven characteristics of successful coachees. Are you willing to hold yourself accountable for making progress? Are you open to new behaviors and ways of thinking? Are you ready to exercise the discipline necessary to stick to your coaching goals? Expect that the experience will cause you both excitement and some anxiety, and be ready to have an honest conversation with your coach about which characteristics are challenging for you. You may find that you’re not yet ready to get the most out of executive coaching, or you may gain insight into what it will take for you to meaningfully develop as a leader. Executive coaching can help you achieve higher performance and greater personal satisfaction at work. While you may be aware that you need to make changes — in behavior, mindset, or both — to advance your career, you won’t reap the benefits of coaching unless you’re prepared to fully engage in the process. This requires a substantial investment of time and effort, so before you move forward, the most important question you should ask yourself is, “Am I ready to be coached?” Having discussed challenging client experiences with many accomplished executive coaches, it’s clear that the corresponding question — “Is this leader coachable?” — figures prominently in their evaluation of whether and how to proceed. Drawing on these conversations, I identified seven core characteristics that differentiate leaders who evolve through coaching from those who don’t. Tolerance for discomfort. Successful coaching requires you to be proactive in embracing new ways of perceiving and acting. In doing so, you will likely experience fear or emotional blocks about new realizations and realities. You must be able to endure these periods of discomfort to realize the rewards of taking new and different approaches. Openness to experimentation. Trying something new means taking risks, and experiments with new behaviors may not work the first time. Waiting for the perfect timing or perfect performance will stand in the way of progress. If you think you already have the answers and are unwilling to explore new options, you are unlikely to be open or do the necessary reflection to change. You have to try out new ideas and actions, fail, learn, and try again. Ability to look beyond the rational. Behavior is not rational — it’s driven by emotions like fear, anger, and pride. Just because you “know” what to do doesn’t mean that you’ll act accordingly. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of your own behaviors and relationships if you explore their emotional dimensions. Willingness to take responsibility. It’s hard to change if you don’t believe you have the power to shape your future. Blaming the organization, the boss, too many responsibilities, and so on will block you from growth. Even if there is some truth in your reasoning, it’s impossible to move forward if you see yourself as a victim. You have to hold yourself accountable for making progress. Capacity for forgiveness. Even if you feel you’ve been mistreated, it’s essential to make peace with the past and channel your energy into progress. The need to “be right” or “show them” is rarely helpful for you or the people you work with. You must be willing to forgive and move on. Self-discipline. Somewhat counterintuitively, your development as a leader will likely require you to let go of ways of thinking and behaving that helped make you successful in the past and be prepared to live with the consequences. It may be hard for others to accept changes in your personal or work relationships. For example, you may have succeeded up to this point by saying yes to helping out colleagues and making yourself available. But disciplining yourself to say no and learning to focus on what’s important are essential parts of becoming a more effective leader. Even if those around you bristle at you no longer being available 24/7, you have to stay focused on your coaching goals. Ability to ask for support. Finally, you must be engaged with other potential supporters, not just your coach, throughout the coaching process. You are accountable for change, but you will develop faster if you make yourself vulnerable to others (judiciously), including your boss, peers, and even direct reports. Share goals, ask for advice, listen with curiosity, and most critically, accept and act on the constructive feedback you receive. It’s normal to feel both excitement and trepidation when deciding to work with an executive coach. Start by assessing the degree to which you have these seven characteristics, then discuss which are the most challenging for you. You may mutually decide that it’s not the right time to proceed. More likely, it will help you develop a stronger relationship and a deeper awareness of how to meaningfully develop as a leader through coaching.

"75",75,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/mentoring-during-a-crisis","managing people.txt","Mentors are important during a crisis, especially for those on the front lines. During the current Covid crisis, doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, postal carriers, and many others have been navigating physical danger, complexity, and uncertainty, with no end in sight. Now more than ever they need emotional support. But they can’t always turn to their managers, who may be consumed with solving problems and overwhelmed with keeping their organizations running. Workers may also fear that managers, who hold the key to future advancement, may view  a request for help as a weakness. Thus mentors can play a critical role, providing a stabilizing force, someone who can help talk them down when they’re triggered, scared, burned out, or confused—all off the record. Mentoring at such stressful times isn’t easy, and the first step that’s often skipped is to take care of yourself. You can’t offer emotional support if you don’t have your own emotional fortifications in place. Then you can turn to helping your mentees by offering them emotional support and concrete tactics. Shortly after September 11, 2001, I (David) stood in the cafeteria line at work, anxieties still swirling in my mind. I happened to see one of my mentors, a senior member of our department; after we exchanged hellos, our conversation quickly turned to current events. I remember he said two simple – yet powerful – words: “It’s scary.” Almost instantly, my fears began to settle, replaced by a sense of connection. Knowing I wasn’t alone made a difference. From our combined ~50 years of experience mentoring healthcare professionals before the Covid crisis, and now during it, we’ve learned just how important mentors can be—especially for those on the front lines. For months, doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, postal carriers, and many others have been navigating physical danger, complexity, and uncertainty, with no end in sight. Now more than ever they need emotional support. But they can’t always turn to their managers, who may be consumed with solving problems and overwhelmed with keeping their organizations running. Workers may also fear that managers, who hold the key to future advancement, may view  a request for help as a weakness. Thus you as a mentor can play a critical role, providing them with a stabilizing force, someone who can help talk them down when they’re triggered, scared, burned out, or confused—all off the record. If you consider yourself a mentor to someone on the front lines, the first step is to take care of yourself. You can’t offer emotional support if you don’t have your own emotional fortifications in place. Then you can turn to helping your mentees by offering them emotional support and concrete tactics. Fortify Yourself First First, take stock of your capacity. Do you have the necessary time, focus, and energy for your mentees? If you’re on the front lines yourself, you’re probably stretched thin, and if you don’t have capacity, accepting this reality is an important act of kindness to yourself and a service to your mentees. If you don’t have time but still want to help, one solution is to help your mentees develop a  “team of mentors.” If you do determine that you have the bandwidth to play a mentorship role, ask yourself: what can I do to fortify myself? Mentors are often accustomed to putting themselves last—or not even on the list—of those whose needs get addressed. But you cannot provide care to others with an empty tank.   We’ve seen well-intentioned colleagues push themselves harder and harder–without regard for self-care—to the point where they had to step away to recover. Adequate sleep, nutrition, exercise, and activities that provide rejuvenation and meaning—such as meditation, prayer, nature walks, listening or playing music—are not luxuries; they are essential.  Micro-practices such as keeping a gratitude journal, deep breathing, and moments of mindfulness such as when using hand sanitizer can build moments of wellness into your day. They take only seconds to minutes to implement. Even a ~15 second practice of “taking in the good,” done consistently, can boost your well-being and put you in a better mindset for helping others. And just as your mentee benefits from having you and other mentors to support them, you need your own support network as well. Highly effective leaders lean on support teams of colleagues near or far and good mentors do the same, scheduling regular check-in calls with friends, family, mentors, coaches, spiritual advisors, or mental health professionals. Mentoring can feel like a solitary job, especially in a crisis: know you are not alone. In the same vein, keep in mind that your relationship with your mentee isn’t one-way. Being open to learning from your mentees can be a source of positive energy for both of you. Reverse mentoring can pay big dividends, both emotionally and practically, especially in the ever-changing virtual world in which digital natives have a lot to teach the rest of us. For example, one of us (Vineet) learned about using virtual whiteboards from a mentee, increasing our ability to teach and engage audiences effectively. Voicing your appreciation for these moments of exchange can also build your relationship and provide its own form of emotional support to your mentee. This kind of self-compassion and self-care can feel hard for mentors to justify, but it will help you be a better mentor—and modeling these behaviors is a great gift you can give your mentees. Attend to Your Mentee’s Emotional Well-Being In your work with your mentee, it may be tempting to focus on teaching them new skills or on giving them advice about how to solve specific technical problems. But for front-line workers, you’re one of the few places they can turn for emotional support, so it’s critical that you make their well-being a focus for any mentoring discussion. Encourage your mentee to share what they’re feeling, reassure them, offer wellness strategies, and affirm their strengths. Begin with listening. Ask your mentees, “How are you really doing?”—more than once. Expect to hear about grief, anxiety, and fear. Encourage them to talk about these feelings: naming emotions helps us feel them, and allows them to flow through us, bringing a helpful shift in brain activity and perspective. Expect too that your mentoring meetings may involve more emotion than usual, including tears. Help your mentee know they’re not alone—“I’ve cried too,” or “I’ve been there myself.” This can assuage their grief, calm the fight-flight-freeze response of their nervous system, and strengthen your relationship. If you’re worried about what exact words to use with your mentees, know that reflective listening is in itself highly supportive. This just involves taking the essence of what the mentee said and offering it back as a connecting confirmation that they have been heard and understood. For example, if your mentee is describing how stressful work is, you could say, “I hear it’s really stressful—and it’s hard to know what to do with the unexpected.”  If you want to dig deeper, you can ask, “What is your biggest challenge right now?  What is helping? What’s going well—or still OK—in your world?” In times of stress, clarifying what is most important to your mentees can be the biggest gift of all. In so doing you help them appreciate and focus on the things that bring meaning and purpose to their life. Second, offer reassurance and opportunities for connection. Discuss lowering expectations in these uncertain times—explaining that they shouldn’t feel they have to push themselves beyond their limits. At the same time, express your appreciation for their strengths. Simply naming them can be surprisingly helpful: “One of the things I most appreciate is your curiosity and drive for learning.” Or: “Coronavirus is one for the history books. You’re helping to pull us through. Thank you.” Finally, share tactics for supporting their emotional well-being. Encourage your mentees to have their own support team and to limit their media exposure. Offer a detail or two about your support team, and how you use it; ask about their own loved ones. Even just talking about mental health resources helps to normalize them. Each of us has used a coach, psychologist, therapist, or spiritual counselor and at various times has shared this fact with our mentees, as appropriate. For both mentors and mentees, this may also be an especially meaningful time to renew dormant connections. Even if it’s been years since you’ve been in touch, a “check-in” call or e-mail can help. And while virtual mentoring may not be as satisfying as the in-person kind, there is evidence supporting its efficacy.  In ways large and small, one person can make a lasting difference. Even a few words, mentioned in passing, can last a lifetime. David P.

"76",76,"https://hbr.org/2020/03/your-employee-tested-positive-for-covid-19-what-do-you-do","managing people.txt","It is likely that managers will have an employee tell you they have tested positive for Covid-19. Not only does the moment call for sensitivity and humanity, but it also requires you to act quickly as a manager.  First, express sympathy. Ask the employee which other employees they have been in close contact with. Connect with your HR partner for guidance and inform those close contacts by phone or video if possible. While your employees will likely have questions, don’t speculate. Encourage them to talk to their doctor. Respect the confidentiality of the employee who tested positive, as well as the close contacts. And encourage senior leaders to check in with any affected employees — it is a gesture that will be universally appreciated. We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. All leaders are trying to find their footing right now. You are probably shoring up your business plan, situating your team, and juggling your own constellation of remote working arrangements — possibly alongside your spouse and children. On top of that, you will face a test you probably couldn’t have imagined a few weeks ago: When one of your employees tells you they have tested positive for Covid-19. If you haven’t dealt with that already, you almost certainly will. This is a particularly complex challenge. Not only does the moment call for sensitivity and humanity, but it also requires you to act quickly as a manager.  As an executive coach, I have coached many senior leaders on high-stakes topics that, like this, require both decisive action and emotional intelligence. Here are my recommendations for how to approach this situation, whether your employees are currently working from home or continuing to go into a workplace: First, when the employee brings you the news, express sympathy. Even if the person’s symptoms are mild, they are likely to be anxious about what might happen or whether they might have spread the virus to their family or coworkers. Let the employee share their feelings. As you talk with them, clearly communicate that they can count on you and the team to be supportive. You could say, for example: “I know that this is a scary thing to deal with. I am here for you if you need to talk, and certainly I understand that you may not be able to work for a little while or that your productivity may go down. Don’t worry about that, I understand what you’re dealing with.” Next, connect with your HR partner. You need to act quickly to minimize the risk of the disease spreading. At this point, most HR departments should have some protocols in place, and you will want to utilize their support and guidance. Minimally, you will need to ask the employee which coworkers they have been in “close contact” with within the prior two weeks. (The CDC defines “close contact” as “a person that has been within six feet of the infected employee for a prolonged period of time.”) If everyone in your company has been working from home during the last two weeks, this may be unlikely, but you should still ask if the infected person had contact with any coworkers. You should alert those who have been in close contact with the employee as soon as possible, repeat the advice given on the CDC site for their situation and, of course, direct them to their own doctors. The law is clear about confidentiality here: You should tell everyone who was possibly exposed at work to the positive employee without revealing that employee’s identity. Then, decide whether you or the HR partner should connect with any close contacts the employee has had. Since this is a sensitive topic, it’s ideal to alert the coworkers by video or phone. But time matters here — if you can’t reach them personally, email them with “important action required” in the subject heading. Either way, your message is the same: “Someone in our workplace has tested positive for Covid-19, and they have identified you as a close contact according to the CDC definition. We are here to support you. If you are at work, please prepare to leave as quickly as you can. Once you get home — or if you are already working from there — find a place to self-isolate, monitor yourself for any symptoms, and talk to your doctors. How can I support you in doing all this?” You can expect people in the close contact group to be nervous and ask a lot of questions, especially if it’s the first time they are receiving such news. Since several days have passed between their exposure to the Covid-positive colleague, they may ask you if their family is at risk. Don’t speculate. You are not a doctor, Instead, refer them to their own physician and to the CDC website. What you can do is reassure them that the company, and you, will be supportive. Follow up this conversation by email. It’s likely that the person you were talking to was feeling overwhelmed and did not catch everything you said. A written follow-up is always good practice, if only to help keep track of this process inside of your company. Once you have spoken with both the employee who tested positive and their close contacts, consider alerting others in the workplace. The message you send here will showcase how your company treats people, so it’s important to be transparent and calming. The ways you communicate this can vary. If the company is a startup with a few hundred employees, it may be appropriate to communicate the news to everyone in an all-hands meeting. If your company is much larger, it’s most important to communicate to the affected department or division. Respect the confidentiality of both the positive-tested employee and anyone in the close-contact group. Then simply give them the facts: “The person tested positive on a certain date and is now self-isolating. The close contacts have been told and were asked to leave the workplace and self-isolate. If you were not already told you were a close contact, then you are not one. If you have questions about Covid-19 or your situation please call your doctor and look at the CDC website. The company is here to support everyone during this difficult time, and we all send our best wishes to the people affected.” Finally, it is helpful for a senior leader, including the CEO, to check in on an employee affected by the coronavirus. In the past week, a CEO I coach has called every one of their employees who tested positive and their close contacts — even if they were showing no symptoms — just to check in, a gesture they universally appreciated. If the cases at your company start to increase dramatically, it will not be realistic for the CEO to call all these people. However senior leaders can and should step in to make as many calls as possible so employees who are affected feel cared for during a difficult time. These are not easy times for anyone, and it is a crucial job of leaders to reassure their employees and keep up their spirits. An employee who reports a positive Covid-19 test requires a sensitive and rapid response. That will help everyone who works for you feel more secure and be more able to focus on the important work at your company right now.

"77",77,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/emerging-from-the-crisis","managing people.txt","In times of great uncertainty, it’s difficult to formulate strategies. Leaders can’t draw on experience to address developments no one has ever seen before. Yet the decisions they make now could have ramifications for decades. The practice of strategic foresight offers a solution. Its aim is not to predict the future but to help organizations envision multiple futures in ways that enable them to sense and adapt to change. Its most recognizable tool is scenario planning. To use it well, organizations must imagine a variety of futures, identify strategies that are needed across them, and begin implementing those strategies now. But one-off exercises are not enough: Leaders must institutionalize that process, building a dynamic link between thinking about the future and taking action in the present. In this roundtable discussion, HBR’s editor in chief, Adi Ignatius, leads a conversation among five top executives: the fashion mogul Tory Burch; Geoff Martha, of Medtronic; Nancy McKinstry, who heads the professional information services firm Wolters Kluwer; Chuck Robbins, of Cisco Systems; and Kevin Sneader, of McKinsey & Company. These executives discuss leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic, how the crisis has affected their companies, and how they are responding. They also speculate on what the future might hold for business: more reliance on digital technology, a new relationship with government, and fresh thinking about social inequality, environmental sustainability, and the delivery of health care. The author collaborated with Elisabeth Kübler-Ross on the book On Grief and Grieving, which adapted the five stages of grief from her landmark work in the late 1960s on the five stages of dying: denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, and acceptance. He has since come to believe that grief has a sixth stage—meaning—which can take many forms: remembering the joy that someone or something gave; rituals of remembrance; gratitude; or turning the loss into something positive for others. In this article Kessler advises leaders, managers, and organizations to recognize that people may be experiencing different kinds of grief and to treat them accordingly. The complete Spotlight package is available in a single reprint. Good strategy creates competitive advantage over time, but the uncertainty of the future makes it difficult to identify effective courses of action, particularly in the midst of a crisis. As a leader, how can you prepare for an unpredictable future while managing the urgent demands of the present? The practice of strategic foresight provides the capacity to sense, shape, and adapt to change as it happens. One important element of the practice is scenario planning, which helps leaders navigate uncertainty by teaching them how to anticipate possible futures while still operating in the present. To make effective strategy in the face of uncertainty, leaders need to institutionalize strategic foresight, harnessing the power of imagination to build a dynamic link between planning and operations. How can we formulate strategy in the  face of uncertainty? That’s the fundamental question leaders must ask as they prepare for the future. And in the midst of a global pandemic, answering it has never felt more urgent. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, rapid technological change, growing economic interdependence, and mounting political instability had conspired to make the future increasingly murky. Uncertainty was so all-encompassing that to fully capture the dimensions of the problem, researchers had devised elaborate acronyms such as VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) and TUNA (turbulent, uncertain, novel, and ambiguous). In response, many leaders sought refuge in the more predictable short term—a mechanism for coping with uncertainty that research has shown leaves billions of dollars of earnings on the table and millions of people needlessly unemployed. By the start of 2020, the sense of uncertainty was so pervasive that many executives were doubling down on efficiency at the expense of innovation, favoring the present at the expense of the future. And then the pandemic hit. Now the tyranny of the present is supreme. A lot of organizations have had no choice but to focus on surviving immediate threats. (There are no futurists in foxholes.) But many business and political discussions still demand farsightedness. The stakes are high, and decisions that leaders make now may have ramifications for years—or even decades. As they try to manage their way through the crisis, they need a way to link current moves to future outcomes. So how best to proceed? Strategic foresight—the history, theory, and practice of which I have spent years researching—offers a way forward. Its aim is not to predict the future but rather to make it possible to imagine multiple futures in creative ways that heighten our ability to sense, shape, and adapt to what happens in the years ahead. Strategic foresight doesn’t help us figure out what to think about the future. It helps us figure out how to think about it. To be sure, a growing body of research has demonstrated that it is possible to make more-accurate predictions, even in chaotic fields like geopolitics. We should use those techniques to the extent we can. But when predictive tools reach their limits, we need to turn to strategic foresight, which takes the irreducible uncertainty of the future as a starting point. In that distinctive context, it helps leaders make better decisions. The most recognizable tool of strategic foresight is scenario planning. It involves several stages: identifying forces that will shape future market and operating conditions; exploring how those drivers may interact; imagining a variety of plausible futures; revising mental models of the present on the basis of those futures; and then using those new models to devise strategies that prepare organizations for whatever the future actually brings. Today the use of scenarios is widespread. But all too often, organizations conduct just a single exercise and then set whatever they learn from it on the shelf. If companies want to make effective strategy in the face of uncertainty, they need to set up a process of constant exploration—one that allows top managers to build permanent but flexible bridges between their actions in the present and their thinking about the future. What’s necessary, in short, is not just imagination but the institutionalization of imagination. That is the essence of strategic foresight. Uncertainty stems from our inability to compare the present to anything we’ve previously experienced. When situations lack analogies to the past, we have trouble envisioning how they will play out in the future. The economist Frank Knight famously argued that uncertainty is best understood in contrast with risk. In situations of risk, Knight wrote, we can calculate the probability of particular outcomes, because we have seen many similar situations before. (A life insurance company, for example, has data on enough 45-year-old, nonsmoking white men to estimate how long one of them is going to live.) But in situations of uncertainty—and Knight put most business decisions in this category—we can only guess what might happen, because we lack the experience to gauge the most likely outcome. In fact, we might not even be able to imagine the range of potential outcomes. The key in those situations, Knight felt, was judgment. Managers with good judgment can successfully chart a course through uncertainty despite a lack of reference points. Unfortunately, Knight had no idea where good judgment came from. He called it an “unfathomable mystery.” Of course, in something of a catch-22, conventional wisdom holds that to a large extent good judgment is based on experience. And in many uncertain situations managers do, in fact, turn to historical analogy to anticipate the future. This is why business schools use the case teaching method: It’s a way of exposing students to a range of analogies—and thus ostensibly helping them develop judgment—much more quickly than is possible in the normal course of life. When situations lack analogies to the past, it’s hard to envision the future. But Knight’s point was that uncertainty is marked by novelty, which, by definition, lacks antecedents. At the very moment when the present least resembles the past, it makes little sense to look back in time for clues about the future. In times of uncertainty, we run up against the limits of experience, so we must look elsewhere for judgment. That’s where strategic foresight comes in. In the United States, strategic foresight can be traced back to the RAND Corporation, a think tank that the U.S. Air Force set up after World War II. Rather than plumbing the mystery of judgment, RAND scholars hoped to replace it with the “rational” tools of quantitative analysis. But as they grappled with the military demands of the postwar world, they could not escape the fact that nuclear weapons had fundamentally changed the nature of warfare. Two countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, had acquired the ability to destroy each other as functioning civilizations. And because no one had ever fought a nuclear war before, no one knew how best to fight (or avoid) one. One RAND analyst, who approached the problem of a potential apocalypse with a glee that made him a model for Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, was a mathematician named Herman Kahn. In the atomic age, Kahn realized, military strategists faced uncertainty to an absolutely unprecedented degree. “Nuclear war is still (and hopefully will remain) so far from our experience,” he wrote, “that it is difficult to reason from, or illustrate arguments by, analogies from history.” How, then, Kahn asked, could military strategists develop the judgment crucial to making decisions about an uncertain future? It was the very question Knight had posed, but unlike Knight, Kahn had an answer: “ersatz experience.” What strategists needed, he suggested, were “strange aids to thought,” in the form of multiple imagined futures that could be developed through simulations such as war games and scenarios. Marc Piasecki/Getty Images In 1961, Kahn left RAND to help found the Hudson Institute, where he eventually shared his ideas with Pierre Wack, an executive from Royal Dutch Shell. In the early 1970s Wack famously applied Kahn’s ideas in the business world, by devising scenarios to help Shell prepare for what might take place as the oil-rich nations of the Middle East began to assert themselves on the world stage. When change did come, in the form of the price shocks induced by the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, Shell was able to ride the crisis out much better than its competitors. (In 1985, Wack chronicled Shell’s efforts in two articles for this magazine: “Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead” and “Scenarios: Shooting the Rapids.”) The Shell exercises marked the birth of scenario planning as a strategic tool for business managers. In subsequent years, Wack’s successors at the company refined his method, and scenario planners from Shell went on to become some of the most prominent scholars and practitioners in the field. Nonetheless, few of the organizations that have conducted scenario-planning exercises in recent decades have institutionalized them as part of a broader effort to achieve strategic foresight. One of the rare exceptions is the U.S. Coast Guard, which describes its work with scenario planning as part of a “cycle of strategic renewal.” As such, it offers a model that many organizations can learn from. One might ask how relevant the Coast Guard’s experience is for businesses, but in fact it constitutes what social scientists call a “crucial-case test.” As a military service, the Coast Guard has less organizational flexibility than most private firms, with a mission mandated by statute and a budget determined by Congress. What’s more, for a long time its need to react daily to numerous emerging situations—from ships in distress to drug interdictions—forced it to focus almost exclusively on the short term, leaving it with little bandwidth to formulate strategy for the long term. Nevertheless, in recent years it has managed to leverage scenario planning to its advantage, reorienting the organization in an ongoing way toward the future. And that, in turn, has allowed it to respond and adapt to disruptive changes, such as those that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks. On that tragic morning, hundreds of thousands of people found themselves trapped in Lower Manhattan, desperate to escape the burning chaos that was Ground Zero. While some were able to walk uptown or across bridges, which officials had closed to vehicles, for many the best way off the island was by water. So over the next hours, an impromptu flotilla—of ferries, tugs, private craft, and fire and police boats—took clusters of people away from the wreckage of the World Trade Center and across the water to safety. Although many vessels operated on their own initiative, a significant part of the evacuation was directed by the Coast Guard, which had issued a call for “all available boats” and coordinated the chaotic debarkation with remarkable poise, creativity, and efficiency. The effort reminded many of the storied British evacuation across the English Channel of several hundred thousand troops that Nazi forces had trapped in Dunkirk, on the coast of France. That the Coast Guard rose to the challenge is no surprise. Although it has a broad set of responsibilities, ranging from search-and-rescue to environmental protection to port security, the organization’s motto is Semper paratus, or “Always ready,” and it prides itself on responding to emergencies. As one retired captain told me, “Our whole idea is, when the alarm goes off, to be able to fly into action.” But September 11 ended up being more than a short-term challenge. In its aftermath, the Coast Guard found its mission quickly expanding. Within a day it was tasked with implementing radically heightened port-security measures around the country: Port security had previously accounted for 1% to 2% of its daily operational load, but it soon consumed 50% to 60%. In March 2003 the Coast Guard was integrated into the new Department of Homeland Security, and that same month it was given the job of securing ports and waterways all over Iraq, following the U.S.-led invasion. In subsequent years the service’s budget would double and its ranks would swell. A new future had arrived. The Coast Guard adapted to this future nimbly—and did so in part because in the late 1990s it had conducted a scenario-planning exercise called Project Long View, which was designed to help the organization contend with “a startlingly complex future operating environment characterized by new or unfamiliar security threats.” Its aim, in effect, was to future-proof the Coast Guard. The service ran Long View in 1998 and 1999—and then, in 2003, in response to the shocks of September 11, renamed it Project Evergreen and began running it every four years. Ever since, the organization has relied on Evergreen to help its leaders think and act strategically. When the Coast Guard decided to launch Long View, it enlisted the help of the Futures Strategy Group (FSG), a consultancy specializing in scenario planning. FSG maintains that uncertainty precludes prediction but demands anticipation—and that imaginatively and rigorously exploring plausible futures can facilitate decision-making. Working with FSG, the Coast Guard identified four forces for change that would have a significant impact on its future: the role of the federal government, the strength of the U.S. economy, the seriousness of threats to U.S. society, and the demand for maritime services. By exploring them and looking forward some 20 years, the team came up with 16 possible “far-future worlds” in which the Coast Guard might have to operate. Of those, Coast Guard leaders selected five that were as distinct as possible from one another (while remaining plausible) and represented the range of environments the service might face. FSG then wrote detailed descriptions of those futures and the fictional events that led to them. Each future world was given a name intended to capture its essence. “Taking on Water” described a future in which the U.S. economy struggled amid significant environmental degradation. In “Pax Americana,” a humbled United States had to contend with a world rent by political instability and economic catastrophe. “Planet Enterprise” was dominated by giant transnational corporations. “Pan-American Highway” featured regional trade blocs oriented around the dollar and the euro. And “Balkanized America” presciently warned of a divided world in which “terrorism strikes with frightening frequency, and increasingly close to home.” NurPhoto/Getty Images Using those scenarios, the Coast Guard convened a three-day workshop, which FSG facilitated. Teams of civilians and officers were assigned to different future worlds and charged with devising strategies that would enable the Coast Guard to operate effectively in them. At the end of the workshop the teams compared notes on what they had come up with. Strategies that appeared again and again, across different teams, were deemed “robust.” In their final report the organizers of Long View listed 10 of these strategies, ranging from the creation of a more unified command structure to the development of a more flexible human-resources system to the establishment of “full maritime domain awareness”—which the Coast Guard defines as the “ability to acquire, track, and identify in real time any vessel or aircraft entering America’s maritime domain.” All of these strategies, they argued, would help the Coast Guard carry out its mission, no matter what the future held. Many of the strategies weren’t novel. But Long View allowed participants to think about them in new ways that proved crucial in the post–September 11 world. In effect, Long View allowed the Coast Guard to pressure-test strategies under a range of plausible futures, prioritize the most-promising ones, and socialize them among the leadership—which meant that after the attacks, when the organization found its mission changing dramatically, it was able to respond quickly. Launching Long View and subsequently establishing Evergreen as a continuous process wasn’t easy. It took exceptionally strong leadership—in particular from admirals James Loy and Thad Allen. The program has also faced challenges in implementing ideas; there is a difference between strategic foresight and strategic execution. But once established, the program developed significant momentum, fueled in part by a growing cadre of alumni who saw the value of a dynamic relationship between the present and the future. The Coast Guard had institutionalized imagination. Long View and Evergreen weren’t designed to bring about a wholesale organizational shift from the operational to the strategic or to train the Coast Guard’s attention primarily on the long term. Instead, the goal was to get its personnel thinking about the future in a way that would inform and improve their ability to operate in the present. That was no small challenge. Management scholars have long noted that, in order to survive and thrive over time, organizations need to both exploit existing competencies and explore new ones. They need to be “ambidextrous.” The problem is that those two imperatives compete for resources, demand distinct ways of thinking, and require different organizational structures. Doing one makes it harder to do the other. Ambidexterity requires managers to somehow resolve this paradox. Long View and Evergreen helped the service’s leaders do that. The programs didn’t reduce the organization’s ability to attend to the present. If anything, the opposite occurred. Exploration enabled exploitation. The Coast Guard members I interviewed for my research reported that Long View and Evergreen accomplished this in several ways. At the most explicit level, they identified strategies that the Coast Guard then pursued. Take maritime domain awareness. The scenarios made it clear to Coast Guard leaders that in any plausible future, they would want the ability to identify and track every vessel in U.S. waters. Although this may seem like an obvious need, it’s not a capability that the service had in the 1990s. As one retired admiral explained, “Ships could come in 10 miles off or even three miles off the United States’ coast, and we might not know it.” That was in part because U.S. agencies had no integrated system for gathering and disseminating information.  Even though the Coast Guard didn’t have the organizational and technological infrastructure to establish full maritime domain awareness immediately, Long View built consensus about its value among top leadership, which helped the service implement it more quickly after 9/11. In fact, the Coast Guard captain who had managed Evergreen led the interagency effort to develop the first National Strategy for Maritime Security, which ultimately prompted the creation of the Nationwide Automatic Identification System—a sort of transponder system for ships. The strategies that emerged from the scenario-planning exercises also enabled personnel who participated in them to act with a greater awareness of the service’s future needs. For example, the first iteration of Evergreen stressed the importance of building strategic partnerships at home and abroad. With this in mind, one senior Coast Guard leader prepared for threats that might emerge in the Pacific by developing bilateral relationships with island nations there; sharing information, coordinating patrols, and holding joint exercises with counterparts in China, Russia, Canada, South Korea, and Japan; and finding ways to work more closely with other U.S. agencies, from the FBI to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the most basic level, Long View and Evergreen simply got the service’s people to think more about the future. The master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard Reserve described how Evergreen had changed his thinking, citing a recent conversation with a colleague: “He and I were here in my office this morning, talking about, ‘Twenty-five years from now, what is the Coast Guard Reserve component going to look like?’” Before taking part in Evergreen, he added, “I just wouldn’t understand how to think that way.” Perhaps most interesting, however—and most important in resolving the supposed paradox between exploration and exploitation—is the way that Long View and Evergreen helped participants understand the demands of the past and the future not as competing but as complementary. The exercises changed the very way in which participants thought about time. Humans tend to conceive of time as linear and unidirectional, as moving from past to present to future, with each time frame discrete. We remember yesterday; we experience today; we anticipate tomorrow. But the best scenario planning embraces a decidedly nonlinear conception of time. That’s what Long View and Evergreen did: They took stock of trends in the present, jumped many years into the future, described plausible worlds created by those drivers, worked backward to develop stories about how those worlds had come to pass, and then worked forward again to develop robust strategies. In this model, time circles around on itself, in a constantly evolving feedback cycle between present and future. In a word, it is a loop. Once participants began to view time as a loop, they understood thinking about the future as an essential component of taking action in the present. The scenarios gave them a structure that strengthened their ability to be strategic, despite tremendous uncertainty. It became clear that in making decisions, Coast Guard personnel should learn not only from past experience but also from imagined futures. The prospect of organizing a scenario exercise can intimidate the uninitiated. There are distinct benefits to enlisting one of the individuals, boutique consultancies, or even large firms that specialize in scenarios to provide helpful direction. However, regardless of who runs the process, managers should follow these key guidelines: One of the chief purposes of a scenario exercise is to challenge mental models of how the world works. To create the conditions for success, you’ll need to bring together participants who have significantly different organizational roles, points of view, and personal experiences. You’ll also need people who represent what Kees van der Heijden, one of Wack’s successors at Shell, has described as the three powers necessary for any effective conversation about strategy: the power to perceive, the power to think, and the power to act. The best scenario planning embraces a decidedly nonlinear conception of time. It’s important to explicitly articulate the assumptions in your current strategy and what future you expect will result from its implementation. Think of this scenario as your projected scenario—but recognize that it’s just one of many possible futures, and focus on determining which assumptions it would be helpful to revisit. Rafael Ramirez, who leads the Oxford Scenarios Programme, advises that in doing this you disaggregate transactional actors, which you can influence or control, from environmental forces, which you cannot. How might those forces combine to create different possible futures? This can be the most difficult part of the exercise, particularly for those used to more analytical modes of thinking. Push yourself to imagine what the future will look like in five, 10, or even 20 years—without simply extrapolating from trends in the present. This takes a high degree of creativity and also requires the judgment to distinguish a scenario that, as the Coast Guard puts it, pushes the envelope of plausibility from one that tears it—an inherently subjective task. Good facilitators can both prime the imagination and maintain the guardrails of reality. Scenario planning is most effective when it’s an immersive experience. Creating “artifacts from the future,” such as fictional newspaper articles or even video clips, often helps challenge existing mental models. It’s also a good idea to disconnect participants from the present, so hold workshops off-site and discourage the use of phones at them. Form teams to inhabit each of your far-future worlds, and give them this challenge: What should we be doing now that would enable us to operate better in that particular future? Create an atmosphere in which even junior participants can put forward ideas without hesitation. Once the groups develop strategies for their worlds, bring them together to compare notes. Look for commonalities, single them out, and identify plans and investments that will make sense across a range of futures. This may sound obvious, but it is the place where most companies fall down. Using scenario planning to devise strategies isn’t resource-intensive, but implementing them requires commitment. To couple foresight with action, leaders should set up a formal system in which managers have to explain explicitly how their plans will advance the firm’s new strategies. Realistically, foresight will not drive every initiative, but scenario exercises can still be valuable in several ways. First, they can provide participants with a common language to talk about the future. Second, they can build support for an idea within an organization so that when the need for implementation becomes clear, it can move faster. Finally, they can enable participants to act at the unit level, even if the organization as a whole fails to link the present and future as tightly as it should. In the long run you’ll reap the greatest value from scenario exercises by establishing an iterative cycle—that is, a process that continually orients your organization toward the future while keeping an eye on the present, and vice versa. This ambidexterity will allow you to thrive under the best of conditions—and it’s essential for survival under the worst. Moving in a loop between the present and multiple imagined futures helps you to adjust and update your strategies continually. This last point is critical. As the current pandemic has made clear, needs and assumptions can change quickly and unpredictably. Preparing for the future demands constant reappraisal. Strategic foresight—the capacity to sense, shape, and adapt to what happens—requires iterative exploration, whether through scenario planning or another method. (See “The Future: A Glossary.”) Only by institutionalizing the imaginative process can organizations establish a continual give-and-take between the present and the future. Used dynamically in this way, scenario planning and other tools of strategic foresight allow us to map ever-shifting territory. Managing the uncertainty of the future requires many tools, some of which have similar or even overlapping functions. To cut through the confusion, here’s a brief guide. Backcasting asks participants to work backward in time from a particular future to ascertain what in the present caused its emergence. The practice is most often used to identify a path to a preferred future but can also be used to avoid steps toward a negative future. “Premortems,” for example, aim to identify the causes of a hypothetical future failure. Contingency planning aids decision-making by preparing participants for specific events that are considered possible or even likely. A contingency plan provides a playbook in case of emergency. Crisis simulations and tabletop exercises have participants respond to specific scenarios and then analyze their actions, to help people prepare for real-life situations. They differ from war games in that they involve a specific possible future rather than a range of plausible futures. Forecasting involves making probabilistic predictions about the future and, as such, is a tool that practitioners of strategic foresight tend to avoid. But it, too, has its place in helping strategists manage uncertainty, adding a quantitative angle to the qualitative methods preferred by, say, scenario planners. The best approach is this: Predict what you can; imagine what you cannot; and develop the judgment to know the difference. Horizon scanning asks participants to search for “weak signals” of change in the present with an eye toward monitoring their development and assessing their potential impact. The practice is guided by the idea that the future often first comes into view in places that most of us are not paying attention to, such as specialized scientific journals. Scenario planning uses stories about alternative futures to challenge assumptions and reframe perceptions of the present. The process does not attempt to predict the future but instead aims to explore plausible futures to inform strategy. Trend analysis asks participants to consider the potential influence of patterns of change that are already visible. A popular structured approach is the STEEP framework, which disaggregates patterns of change into five categories: social, technological, economic, environmental, and political. War games ask participants to engage an opponent in simulated conflict, often to explore reactions to novel circumstances. Like scenario planning, war games do not attempt to predict what will happen; rather, they project what could happen, thereby providing insight into decision-making. Despite the name, war games can address far more than just the military aspects of conflict. Of course, strategic foresight also enables us to identify opportunities and amplifies our ability to seize them. Organizations don’t just prepare for the future. They make it. Moments of uncertainty hold great entrepreneurial potential. As Wack once wrote in these pages, “It is precisely in these contexts—not in stable times—that the real opportunities lie to gain competitive advantage through strategy.” It takes strength to stand up against the tyranny of the present and invest in imagination. Strategic foresight makes both possible—and offers leaders a chance for legacy. After all, they will be judged not only by what they do today but by how well they chart a course toward tomorrow.

"78",78,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/how-to-design-a-better-hiring-process","managing people.txt","Many standard interview processes rely on outdated behavioral questions like “What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?” to evaluate prospective hires. But more often than not, these types of questions fail to reveal useful information about a candidate’s competencies. A better approach is to immerse job candidates in unconventional scenarios to gather the most useful insights about their critical-thinking abilities, tech savviness, and interpersonal skills. For example, if you want to test their ability to prepare, let them know the questions you’ll ask beforehand. If you want to test their technical skills, give them a problem to solve in real-time. And if you want to see if they’ll be a good cultural fit, have them play an interactive game with your employees. Shortly after we started hiring for our business, we recognized that most traditional interview processes are flawed, at best. At the time, we had a goal of growing our CRM software company from six to 18 employees. Our objectives were simple: Find talented people to contribute to our culture, generate great work, and stay with us for the long term. To avoid retention issues, we decided to focus on optimizing our interview process early on as opposed to relying on outdated behavioral questions to guide us. Think of the classic prompts: What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses? Tell me about a time you overcame a challenge at work. Many employers still use these types of questions simply because they’ve heard them before. The standard interview is a tradition of sorts that has been passed down from one generation to another. But, as we discovered through our own missteps, it is unreliable. Behavioral questions might be useful for testing someone’s ability to relay biographical information. However, unless storytelling or some equivalent skill is a requirement of the position being filled, they often fail to reveal sufficient information about a candidate’s competencies. My team and I have spent the last five years trying to address this issue. Through trial and error, we have used our own experiences, as well as the most recent research available, to create a process that immerses job candidates in unconventional scenarios to gather the most useful insights about their critical-thinking abilities, tech savviness, and interpersonal skills. Since deployment, we have seen improvements both in the quality of our hires and what they bring to the company. As a result, our retention has improved significantly. In the past seven years, we’ve had only four full-time employees leave — two for grad school and two for jobs outside of our industry. Today, we believe our process can be a solution for companies struggling with the impacts of Covid-19. Many businesses around the world have had to cut their budgets just to get by, while changing consumer needs are forcing others to either reskill or hire new employees to fill in the gaps. Given how expensive hiring is, and the fact that only around a third of U.S. companies monitor their practices, our approach may help organizations save both time and money by finding the right people for the right roles. Here is how it works. First, it is important to note that our process varies. We aim to structure our interviews around the skills we’re looking for from each candidate and give them the opportunity to demonstrate those skills. Because no two candidates are the same, naturally, neither are two interviews. Prior to all of our interviews, we share the questions we’ll be asking with candidates. We ask these questions during the conversational portion of the interview, which comes first and takes 45 to 90 minutes. We’re intentionally flexible with time here to allow for whatever subsequent discussions may arise. Typically, our questions are broken down into three categories: 1) To test for preparation, we ask questions that are easy to research. For example, “Can you tell us what you know about our company?” is something that a quick Google search could answer. 2) To test for critical-thinking and tech savviness, we ask open-ended questions designed to start a conversation and spark creativity in the candidate. For example, we often ask engineering candidates how they would design an app to accomplish a certain task (view pictures of animals, for instance). We ask customer service or salesperson candidates to choose a piece of software they are familiar with and demo it to us. During an in-office interview, we would ask the candidate to control the mouse and keyboard to demo the software on a large monitor while we watch. In a Covid-19 world, we would ask them to demonstrate the product via Zoom. 3) To test for listening and communication skills, we format some questions as directions. This gives candidates a clear idea of what we want from them while, at the same time, allowing us to see whether they can deliver. For example, to measure a candidate’s ability to communicate effectively, we might say: “Teach us about one of your passions, something that you know a lot about or consider yourself to be a nominal expert in — and teach us as if we know nothing about it.” Many of our questions in categories two and three allow candidates to pick the topics of discussion themselves, as opposed to us thrusting ideas upon them. We aspire to stimulate a discussion that they (hopefully) want to engage in. If candidates choose topics they don’t actually know much about or aren’t able to explain, despite having time to prepare beforehand, it shows us that they didn’t care enough about the interview or the position to put the time in. Essentially, we want our hires to have the ability to think ahead and draw on real knowledge and experience in high-pressure situations. What we don’t want is to hire people simply because they have a knack for saying what they think we want to hear. Of course, today, we would be carrying out this process virtually over video calls. There are some pros to this, however. The video format would help us measure an additional, newly required skill: online communication. Over video, we can determine a candidate’s tech savviness with programs like Zoom, as well as how they present themselves over video — an important skill, as this is how many members of our team will be interacting with prospects, customers, and other employees for the foreseeable future. After the question portion of the interview, we schedule a 45- to 90-minute chat between the candidate and a team member who is an expert in their field, followed by a short exercise to test their collaboration skills. During the chat, our team members typically ask candidates role-specific questions to help us gauge whether they have a genuine interest in the work they’d be doing. With customer service positions, for example, we ask candidates whether they think helping people is rewarding, whether they like talking on the phone, and so on. Depending on the candidate and the flow of that interview, we might also ask less direct, general questions about their interests and what work they find most rewarding. If our hires love the work they are doing, we’ve found that they are more likely to stay for the long term. For the exercise portion of this stage, we aim to create scenarios that will allow us to see candidates’ skills in action and evaluate how well they collaborate with other employees. This time also gives the candidate an opportunity to experience what it would be like to work on a specific team. For instance, we may ask an engineering candidate to participate in pair programming — a technique in which two developers work together on a problem. While pair programming is a common practice in many coding job interviews, we’ve incorporated similar team exercises into the interviews for all of our roles. As with part one of the interview, we let candidates know beforehand which topics will be covered in the technical portion, as it puts the onus on them to come prepared. Video-conferencing technology that incorporates elements like screen-sharing and tools designed specifically for remote code interviews, such as CodeBunk, can be helpful in conducting these exercises virtually. Many companies collect writing samples from candidates before or after an initial interview. But we believe it is more beneficial to govern this process more closely because it gives us insight into the quality of a candidate’s writing without any outside assistance. We want to know that all of our hires will be able to communicate clearly in writing without extensive editing and, sometimes, under time pressure. Though we can’t ensure people aren’t seeking outside assistance as well virtually, our process still gives us a good idea of their writing and communication skills. The assignment we give is specific to the role each candidate is applying for. For example, we give customer service candidates a sample email of a hypothetical angry client, as well as an example email response that reflects our ideal company voice. We ask that they mimic the company voice and write up a client response email of their own; we also expect them to ask as many questions as possible beforehand — and take notes. We don’t specify the length of response, but the example gives them a good idea of our expectations. In the office, we typically give candidates 30-45 minutes in a quiet room to complete the writing assignment. Virtually, we would schedule a break in our video call to give them 30-45 minutes to complete the assignment. After they’ve finished, we would resume the interview online as we review the assignment and ask why they chose certain phrasing or structures in their response. When we review the sample, we look at whether they can think critically about composition and voice, and demonstrate thoughtfulness overall. We want to know how candidates will interact with their prospective colleagues on a day-to-day basis. But instead of making assumptions based on their answers to interview questions — like “How would your co-workers describe you?” or “What role do you tend to play on a team?” — our process allows us to observe their actual interactions. In the office, we design peer interactions around board games that challenge players to work together toward a goal, as opposed to games that pit players against one another in a zero-sum scenario. Virtually, we would go with a game, such as Codenames, that’s easier to play in a remote setting, but still allows for that key element of collaboration. The goal is twofold: Learn about how the candidate interacts with team members and show them that this will be a fun place to work. Because candidates interact with numerous employees throughout our interview process, many of whom don’t share their backgrounds or interests, we find team members who might have more common ground with them for this portion of the interview. While it’s important for us to make sure the candidate can engage with a diverse group of our employees, during this time specifically, we want them to feel comfortable, conversational, and included. If our current team is made up of individuals over the age of 45, for instance, and we’re interviewing a recent college graduate, we don’t necessarily look for the youngest person in the office to include in this step. Instead, we might look to include the newest, least experienced members of our team, regardless of age, to help the candidate feel more comfortable and less intimidated by experienced employees. The outcome of the game isn’t important. We’re looking for signs of a good cultural fit over the course of the three to four hours the players are together. For us, that means candidates are thoughtful, engaging, curious, and make a visible effort to enjoy the experience (even if they are faking it). These attributes aren’t role-specific; they’re qualities we value as a company. The four pillars above require regular iteration and experimentation. After each round of hiring, we sit down to evaluate the success of our process by looking at a couple of different factors. One of these is how often each pillar swayed our decision. Were we able to make more confident choices using these steps? If so, we take that as validation that the process is working. If not, we take a deeper look at what’s not working and how we can fix it. The most important factor we use to evaluate the success of our process, though, is the quality of our hires. A couple of years ago, when we realized we had hired many interns who were perfectly capable of doing their work but weren’t actually interested in the work itself, we knew we had a quality problem to address. Some interns told us during exit interviews that they were just using the internship as a stepping-stone for their next destination, and some declined full-time job offers from us. That’s when we began drafting up more role-specific questions to ask candidates during the technical portion of the interview. Only then did we see our retention grow stronger. Our post-interview evaluation is another element of our process we had to adjust. Initially, staff members talked to each other about the candidate throughout the interview day (without the candidate present) and compared experiences. But we found this created bias and other conflicts throughout the interview itself. Now we forbid employees to talk with anyone about the candidate until after the interview is completed. Once it is, everyone who participated fills out a full survey with feedback about the various areas we assessed. After everyone has filled out the survey, we allow open discussion. It may be tempting for some leaders to simply accept that hiring is not a perfect science and use that as an excuse to stick with the same outdated interview process corporations have relied on for decades. But today, it’s safe to say that most businesses can’t afford to take a chance on bad hires. We think it’s possible to design an interview process that provides a clear assessment of a candidate’s skills, aptitude, and potential for culture fit. Our four pillars can be used as a framework for those who wish to do so.

She’d been excited about her new role as a program manager at Rescue, the oldest and largest aid organization fighting global poverty. She’d risen early; walked her dogs; eaten breakfast with her boyfriend, Mateo; packed a lunch; and still managed to get to the office before 9:00. She’d thought arriving early would make a good impression.   When Mia walked into the lobby, she saw a few familiar faces from her previous visit, but the receptionist was the only one to greet her. His name was Anthony, and although she thought they’d bonded last time, he looked up at her quizzically. “Can I help you?” he asked. “It’s great to see you again,” Mia said. “I’m Mia, the new program manager.” “Oh, right,” Anthony said, unsmiling. “Take a seat, and I’ll give you some paperwork to fill out while I grab your manager. It’s Michael, right?” Mia had been in the building for less than five minutes and already she felt discouraged. Things didn’t improve from there. Anthony couldn’t find Michael, so he escorted her back to a dim room full of cubicles. The one person already there, a support team coordinator named Jessie Carbone, introduced herself quickly, explained that IT hadn’t set up Mia’s desk yet, suggested that she sit at a vacant workstation, and went back to typing. At 10:30 Michael finally stopped by to hand Mia a stack of reading material and explain that his day was packed but he hoped to catch up with her later that afternoon. He never did.1 Mia spent five hours coordinating with HR and IT via her cell phone and personal email account. She ate lunch at the borrowed desk. A few other employees came in and out during the day, and she smiled warmly and waved, but no one seemed to know who she was. Finally a technician arrived with a laptop and a monitor, which he installed at the desk farthest from the window. Mia found herself thinking wistfully about her previous workplace, Azzurro, a start-up that used IoT-enabled container sensors to help retail businesses better manage waste. She’d joined it just after graduating from the University of Bologna with a degree in international management and had been promoted to business analyst in less than four years. She liked the work and the people. But then she met Saul Rizzo, a senior HR director at Rescue, at a networking event. He mentioned a role at the organization’s new outpost in Bologna—one of its 92 offices worldwide—and Mia was immediately intrigued. The job would include setting up data and reporting systems and working with a seasoned Rescue manager to outline critical business processes and identify key performance indicators. At an interview a few weeks later, Saul had offered her a salary nearly double what Azzurro was paying her and promised that she would not only have a personal growth plan but also be able to work on the ground once a month helping populations in crisis. It had seemed like a no-brainer to make the move. Mateo agreed. Now, considering whether she should book a meeting with Michael for the next day—basically forcing him to onboard her properly—Mia wondered if she’d made the right decision.2 Just then she got a text from Mateo: “How was it???” She replied with a thumbs-down emoji and “I need a drink. Let’s meet at the usual spot.” “It was a disaster,” Mia said after recounting her workday. Mateo nodded empathetically. “Do you think I made a mistake? I mean, I really liked Azzurro, but the humanitarian work sold me on Rescue.” “Don’t forget the pay!” Mateo said jokingly. Mia sighed. As the primary breadwinner in their household (Mateo was a struggling artist), she was already feeling the pressure.3 “Seriously, though,” he went on. “It’s too early to know. It’s such a different culture, and Rescue is a huge organization. How many employees did Azzurro have?” “A hundred,” she said. “Rescue has thousands.” “Right. And they’re just setting up this branch. It may be a particularly chaotic time.”4 “It’s just so weird to have no official welcome, no onboarding, not even any real assignment. I’ve spoken with Michael only twice—on the phone during the interview process and very briefly this morning. You’d think he’d want to at least have a conversation with me on my first day.” “I’m sure it was an anomaly,” Mateo said. “Tomorrow will be better. Rescue is reputable, and on paper this is a good career move.” “I know, I know. You’re right.” Mia gulped her wine. She just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The following afternoon Mia finally met with Michael. “Mia, welcome,” he said brusquely. “Sorry I couldn’t get to you earlier—I’ve been tied up in strategy meetings. As you can see, we’re still getting our systems in order. Let’s talk about your first project.” He said he wanted her to audit the processes of three departments—warehouse, supply chain, and delivery—that were essential to Rescue’s missions. Each unit combined employees transferred from other Rescue offices and recent hires brought in to help experiment with new strategies. Mia’s job was to see whether those strategies were more efficient than Rescue’s current ones. The assignment was not what she had expected, but she nodded and smiled. “Anything else?” Michael asked, turning back to his laptop. “Actually,” Mia said, “when I was recruited, Saul mentioned that I’d have a chance to participate in some field projects.” Michael looked surprised—and a little annoyed. “Hmm. I don’t mean to disappoint you, Mia, but that’s not what I had in mind for this position. We’re just building this operation, and we need internal staff members to stay focused on their responsibilities here.” He shook his head. “I’m sorry, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon.” “OK,” Mia said, trying to hide her dismay.5 Mia spent the next three weeks toiling away at the auditing project, but it wasn’t easy. Michael had forgotten to introduce her to a few department heads, so although some were friendly and forthcoming, others ignored her repeated emails or only reluctantly shared information. She’d asked Michael for advice several times, but he’d basically blown her off. And when her work was finished, it took her five days to get half an hour with him to present her findings. He’d been complimentary but then asked her to track some new metrics. She asked about broadening the scope of her duties, but his phone rang, and he waved her away. “Sorry, I have to take this. Let’s discuss next time we meet.”6 Desperate to confide in someone besides Mateo, Mia asked Jessie if she’d ever had any problems getting Michael’s attention. “It’s not his fault,” Jessie said. “It’s this organization. It’s just such a bureaucracy. He has to run every new idea up the food chain. We’re always short-staffed because they’re always opening new offices. And they move people around so much that everyone’s constantly in learning mode, trying to get up to speed on a new geography. Don’t get me wrong—we do amazing work out in the field. We do help people. But inside, it’s a slog.”7 “Do you ever get involved in that outside work?” Mia asked. “Oh, no. We’re the back office. Our job is to help the people who are experts at fieldwork do theirs.” Her heart sank. Mia decided she’d email Saul and request a video call. To her surprise, he replied within the hour and said he had 30 minutes free at 5:00. Mia was determined to be up-front about her disappointment. She outlined how unnecessarily difficult her initial assignment had been and how rarely she interacted with Michael, even though she thought part of her job was to partner with him on performance indicators. “Plus he doesn’t seem open to my doing any direct humanitarian work, even though that was a big pull for me,” she said. Saul looked concerned. “I know, and I mentioned that to him. My sense is that the audits are just the first step and that you’ll get into the more interesting work soon. He may have forgotten our discussion because things are so hectic right now.” He asked her to be patient and promised to talk with Michael. “We’re lucky you’re here, Mia. Let’s see if we can turn things around.”8 That evening Mia was doing the dishes after dinner when her phone signaled a new email. It was from Michael. She called Mateo into the kitchen to hear the message: “Dear Mia, I’m writing to let you know that I spoke with Saul this evening. We discussed your role and the misalignments that resulted in a negative experience for you. Given the demands of my role, it’s difficult for me to meet regularly with all the members of my team, but I’m happy to set up a weekly check-in to support you. There are certain tasks that will greatly benefit the organization that I’d like you to stick with. But there may be other responsibilities we can add that would be more in line with your interests. Best regards, Michael” “Hmm,” Mateo said. “Is he sorry for being such a bad boss since you started, or is he angry at you for talking to Saul?” “I’m not sure,” Mia replied. “He’s saying the right things, but it’s such a cold, formal email, so I can’t help feeling that he sent it only because he got in trouble. Maybe going over Michael’s head was a mistake.”9 “Well, you’ve tried talking to Michael and didn’t get anywhere. And it’s clear he didn’t understand what Saul promised you, so they needed to have a conversation. Even if he’s saying all this under duress, at least he’s saying it.” “But can I trust him? Can I trust the organization? It has such a great reputation, but from the inside it seems like a mess.” Mateo hugged her. “You’ve never been the kind of person to settle,” he said. “If it’s that bad, maybe it’s time to cut your losses.” “And do what? I need a job.” “Of course. We rely on your income. But what did your boss say when you left Azzurro? She said you could always come back.” “Doesn’t everyone say that?” “No. They loved you there.” Mia smiled, but she was still conflicted. “I guess I could reach out to recruiters, too.” “See—you have options.” “I know. I need to think more about what I’m going to do.” “Well, I’m here to talk whenever you need to. I’ll support your decision.” IF YOU DON’T like your current situation, you have the power to change it. I would encourage Mia to actively start looking for another job. She needs to reframe her negative experience at Rescue as an opportunity to consider what will really make her happy. Does she want to be more involved in a career track that includes fieldwork? Is an office environment with natural light and standing desks (as opposed to a dark space filled with cubicles) important for her mental health? We already know she’s a marketable candidate. She was recruited and offered twice her salary to work at a respected nonprofit. And because she has a steady income, she has time to be strategic and consider other job options. Looking for a job is like a job in itself, but it will be worth it if Mia can find one better suited to her goals and personal needs. I experienced a similar situation. A few years ago I joined a prestigious news outlet. Like Rescue, it was a large organization with serious bureaucracy problems. Processes weren’t streamlined, and people needed approvals at many levels to get things done. This lack of agility meant that the organization struggled with employee development. As a result, my manager and I had different expectations regarding my role. Mia is facing the same thing. In a bureaucracy, without a supportive boss, it can take months, even years, for the situation to change. And Michael’s icy email implies that he already resents Mia for going over his head—a red flag that suggests he may not be open to change. Even if his reasons are justified, their relationship will probably continue to be emotionally exhausting for Mia. What Mia can control is how she reacts. She can think about what she’s looking for in a work environment and culture and outline where she wants to be in five to 10 years. She can update her résumé and craft a story to explain her short time at Rescue. I’d recommend that she tell an honest one: “I was recruited, but in the end there were some misalignments between the role I was told I’d be taking on and the work I was doing.” She doesn’t need to go into a lot of detail. I left the news outlet years ago and found a job at a much smaller company that was a better cultural fit. I was also given more leadership opportunities, which allowed me to launch my long-term career. Later on I learned that the structural problems at the news outlet ended up hurting the business because it couldn’t keep up with changing technologies. If Mia stays at Rescue, she risks spinning her wheels and halting her professional development. She needs to be a self-starter and put her happiness first. MIA SHOULD STICK with Rescue for a bit longer. She is only a month in and needs to give it more time. Change always comes with some challenges. I’d encourage her to revisit what originally drove her to take this role. First, the organization is very much more in alignment with her interest in humanitarian work than Azzurro was. And although she is understandably excited by the prospect of actually working in the field, she will soon learn how crucial internal support staff members like her are to making this work possible. Nonprofits today depend on strong data and analytics to remain competitive in their fields and to present valid, evidence-based reporting to their partners. Second, this role is more challenging than her previous one was. She is taking on new and different responsibilities, which naturally come with a period of discomfort. But that’s normal. At the end of the day, this job is going to stretch her in ways that her previous role didn’t. She will walk away with a much broader skill set in a field she is passionate about. Without putting the blame on anyone in particular, it appears that there were some failures in the interview process that have led to a misalignment between Mia’s expectations and Michael’s. It doesn’t seem to me that this is the result of poor leadership or an issue of organizational structure, either of which would be of greater concern. As written, Mia’s job description—setting up data systems and identifying key performance indicators—is a very internal one. If we could go back a month, I would caution her to take a closer look at what exactly she was being hired to do and to clarify her day-to-day responsibilities. For example, “Does identifying KPIs mean I’d be going into the field, or would that work take place in the office?” What Mia can do now is revisit that job description to see whether it matches the tasks she’s been assigned so far. Recruiters do sometimes make promises to expand roles when they are trying to draw in candidates. Since Mia was indeed promised fieldwork by Saul, Michael has a responsibility to follow through. When and how that will happen needs to be made clear. It’s a good sign that Michael addressed this issue head-on, even if he did so in an email. He may have been doing it grudgingly, but he seemed to be offering Mia an olive branch and a chance for the two of them to get on the same page. If Mia chooses to stick it out for at least six months, she can take small, proactive steps to improve her situation. It is Michael’s responsibility to make time for weekly check-ins, but it is Mia’s responsibility to set the agenda for those meetings. Before going into them, she should outline what she wants to discuss, including questions she has about upcoming projects and how to overcome challenges she may be facing. She needs to take the initiative to get guidance from Michael rather than waiting for him to offer it. Even if we weren’t in the midst of an economic downturn, I’d advise Mia to stay on for now. If she is still unhappy in the role after six months, maybe she does need to think about other possibilities. But she will walk away with a stronger résumé and a better skill set, which will position her to have more options."
"80",80,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/what-to-say-when-someone-cries-at-work","managing people.txt","When someone cries at work, showing curiosity and compassion, even if you’re uncomfortable, is core to being an emotionally intelligent leader. What should you say to someone who’s crying at work? Try something like: “Let’s pause for a moment here. I can see you’re crying. Would you like to take a break or keep going? It’s up to you.”  This is neutral language that gives someone the opportunity to choose what they want and need next. Or, say: “I’m going to stop our conversation for a second to check in with you. Can you tell me what’s going on for you right now?” This demonstrates compassion and curiosity for the person, without dramatizing or overplaying concern. Or, try: “You’re crying, so let’s pause. What would be most helpful for you right now? I’ll follow your lead.”  This acknowledges what’s happening, while empowering the person to take control. I was recently coaching a leader who asked me, “Is it OK for me to tell someone on my team that they can’t cry at work?” Normally, as a coach, I would respond to her question with a question of my own: “What makes you ask that?” “What about crying feels like it shouldn’t happen at work?” “What might the impact be of telling them that they can’t cry at work?” But instead of taking a coaching approach, I responded instinctively and firmly, “No.” We know from Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own that “there’s no crying in baseball,” but no movie that I’ve watched has given us a clear answer on what to do about crying at work. And there is crying at work — whether we like it or not. It may be the result of a feedback conversation that feels hard, a career planning session that’s disappointing, a difficult conversation about unrealistic expectations, or it may even seem like it comes out of nowhere. And for many of us, seeing someone cry can make us feel uncomfortable, guilty, and anxious. Why do we have that reaction? For several reasons: Helping someone who is crying at work takes emotional intelligence, especially in the form of self-awareness and self-management. Self-awareness requires that we recognize that someone else’s emotional expression is having an impact on us, and are able to articulate what that impact is (fear, concern, anger, etc.). Self-management requires that we control our emotions in the moment, and adapt to what’s needed right now. And what’s needed right now, in most cases, is for you to say something helpful, supportive, and brief. What isn’t needed? So what can you say instead? Emotions are data, and the visible (and audible) expression of emotions, like crying, shouldn’t be ignored or minimized. Showing curiosity and compassion, even if you’re uncomfortable, is core to being an emotionally intelligent leader.

"81",81,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/why-employee-experience-initiatives-fall-short","managing people.txt","After a decade of growth and historically low unemployment, organizations now find themselves in a much different world. But even as companies are forced to shed jobs and dramatically tighten belts, smart managers must keep their eyes on the horizon: Recessions eventually end, and when this one does, companies in many industries will return to an atmosphere where keeping talent happy is a priority.   That can be a challenge. According to a global study by the research and advisory firm Gartner, in 2019 companies spent an average of $2,420 per person on efforts to enhance the employee experience. Such initiatives typically include flexible work policies, workplace redesigns, and learning and development opportunities, to cite just a few examples. When organizations meet their workers’ experience expectations, the researchers found, they see boosts in effort, productivity, and retention. But the ROI from such initiatives is disappointing: Only 13% of employees in the study reported being fully satisfied with their experience. “Simply investing in these programs is not enough,” says Caroline Walsh, a vice president in Gartner’s human resources practice. “Companies taking that approach only drive up expectations,” creating a vicious cycle in which employee desires and organizational spending fuel each other. The study—a survey of nearly 150 HR executives and 3,000 employees worldwide—reveals that for better returns, organizations need to complement investments with measures to help shape people’s understanding of their experience. That’s a three-part process. Most companies ask employees what they want from their work experience—but too often they stop there. “Expectations are relative,” Walsh says, pointing out that they are influenced by prior jobs, personal events, peers, and other factors. They may also be incomplete: Research shows that only about a fifth of employees are candid about their wishes. And those may be infeasible or impossible to implement. So an organization should be clear about what it can—and can’t—deliver given the available resources and priorities, which will change as the economy ebbs and flows. “There need to be some guardrails,” Walsh says. “Is this idea relevant to the entire company? Is it tied to our business goals and strategy?” Once those guardrails are in place, HR leaders should involve employees in creating a companywide “experience vision”—for instance, by surveying them about what changes they would implement and what makes them excited to come to work. Managers should take a long view, focusing on salient events, not smaller incidents. Finally, rather than issue top-down, blanket directives about what to expect, managers should engage in one-on-one dialogues to align each employee’s hoped-for experience with the organizational vision. At Silicon Valley Bank, employees create “experience blueprints” in daylong workshops designed to help them determine and document their priorities. These become the basis for ongoing conversations with their managers (whom SVB calls coaches) about what to anticipate and whether those priorities are reflected in their realities over time. Most organizations recognize the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all approach, but customization usually falls to managers, who may have limited bandwidth, may lack full visibility into what each employee wants, and may not be completely trusted by direct reports. Firms get better results when managers partner with employees to this end. The first step is sharing information so that workers can see places to make improvements. “It’s hard to benchmark your experience if it’s a sample of one,” says Leah Johnson, also a VP in Gartner’s HR practice. One large software company created a dashboard on which it posts biannual engagement survey results and personal descriptions of experiences employees have had. Town hall meetings and webinars can serve the same purpose. A team learning that members lack confidence in their digital skills might request training, for example, while an employee with young children might look for areas of the firm with the work/life balance he’s seeking. Tim Bower Employees might fear repercussions from voicing their requests, so leaders need to create a psychologically safe environment for discussions. To keep people from being overwhelmed by possibilities, managers can provide each worker with a set of relevant choices—for instance, personalized suggestions for training opportunities. They can create default options to make it easier to act. And they can connect employees with others in the organization who have insights to share. Organizations often focus on responding to negative experiences with all possible speed—but that doesn’t always help, and it can mean engaging in issues that don’t actually matter much to employees or the business. Managers should borrow a leaf from the customer-experience book and take a long view, concentrating on how employees will recall their experience over time and focusing on salient events rather than on incidents, such as technology glitches, that may feel urgent in the moment but quickly fade. They can seek to reframe memories of negative experiences by acknowledging that a problem occurred and emphasizing that because of the employee’s feedback, things will go better in the future. As part of Microsoft’s Acknowledge It email initiative, HR and business leaders send personal messages to employees who had rocky moments in their onboarding, thanking them for their feedback and underscoring how it made a difference for others. They also send thank-you emails during the offboarding process, acknowledging the contributions of departing employees. Since rolling out the initiative two years ago, the company has seen boosts in engagement, retention, and advocacy. Peter Vultaggio is the global head of talent development and change management at Silicon Valley Bank. He recently spoke with HBR about the organization’s “experience blueprints”—an ongoing initiative to help employees identify the values, interests, strengths, and goals that are most important to them. Edited excerpts follow. How did you begin? The first task was to encourage more-expansive thinking among employees. We ran workshops on the neuroscience of change, on mindset, on mindfulness, to start cracking open our ways of seeing ourselves and what we’re capable of. Only after that did we move to the blueprint workshops. Describe how those work. These are full-day immersive sessions that help employees learn about themselves and discover what they value most. In one exercise, for example, participants think about people they look up to, and we help them break down the specific behaviors they admire and want to emulate. By talking about the results in one-on-ones and in groups, people form a story about themselves that they can share with their teammates and coaches and with the larger firm. What happens then? The real power comes after the workshops, as employees have ongoing conversations with their coaches. Once they’ve identified their key values and areas of interest, there’s the question: What’s keeping you from them? In some cases, people decide they’re in the wrong role and move to a different position or department. Other times, they realize that pursuing a particular interest doesn’t align with certain priorities they’ve just identified—family or community work, say—and they internally recalibrate, reducing a source of stress and angst. Some people find that our firm actually isn’t a good fit, and they leave with our blessing. How do you create a psychologically safe space for this work? Coaches go through the workshops in small groups alongside their teams, so they are learning about themselves and their people at the same time, which helps everyone feel more secure. And there aren’t any mandates: Everyone goes at their own speed. Coaches are trained to ask open-ended questions that let people share as they see fit. What challenges did you face? At first, our leadership was concerned that people might not be realistic about what we could accommodate, though we actually found the opposite. In addition, some people initially said, “I’m not sure I’m comfortable with this—it sounds like therapy.” We had to overcome that. Finally, time and cost were an issue. We operate a lot of call centers and had to be creative about how we rotated people in and out to attend the workshops. But the firm quickly saw that this more than pays for itself by what we get back and how great the employees come to feel about themselves and SVB. What gains have you realized? More people are taking advantage of development opportunities as they become more confident about what to seek out. Business units that have gone through the workshop are also seeing improvements in engagement. And we can run change management a lot more smoothly now. When people are working on things they value and feel good about their contributions, it’s a little easier to turn the ship. It’s equally important to reinforce positive experiences—an insight that was one of the researchers’ biggest “aha” moments, Johnson says. Too many firms treat employee experience initiatives like a marketing campaign, issuing formal statements when they are introduced—an approach that can feel inauthentic and irrelevant. One large government agency has taken a different tack. It created a road map depicting all its employee experience improvements, from new phone systems to a mental health resources program. HR leaders ask employees to reflect on how the programs have improved their work lives and encourage them to post their stories on the road map and share them in team meetings, off-sites, internal newsletters, and other forums. As companies emerge from the current crisis, leaders might seek ways to highlight examples of how they supported their employees, such as by continuing to pay sidelined workers or providing extended sick leave. All these activities should supplement, not replace, an organization’s fundamental investments in experience, the researchers emphasize. “Companies have to be shaping the experience of something,” Walsh says. They constitute a significant opportunity for employees and employers alike. Each year, Gartner finds, organizations that take a shaping approach will have largely satisfied 32% more employees than their counterparts have, at a 32% lower cost. Those employees will be less likely than others to jump ship, and they’ll put in more discretionary effort and perform at higher levels—raising their companies’ chances of meeting their customer satisfaction, innovation, and reputational goals."

"83",83,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/u-s-businesses-must-take-meaningful-action-against-racism","managing people.txt","Millions of Black people and their allies are hurting, and today’s challenges reach far beyond marginalization in the workplace. The psychological impact of these public events — and the way it carries over into the workplace — cannot be overstated. Research shows that how organizations respond to large-scale, diversity-related events that receive significant media attention can either help employees feel psychologically safe or contribute to racial identity threat and mistrust of institutions of authority. The authors offer three missteps to avoid —keeping silent, becoming overly defensive, and overgeneralizing — as well as ways that companies and leaders can take meaningful action. The United States is in crisis. As we write this article, videos of racial violence and racist threats toward Black people in America flood social and news media channels. Public demonstrations against injustice are happening in at least 30 localities. During non-violent protests, other parties have engaged in vandalism and looting, spurring varied and often disproportionate police response. Several cities are burning, while Covid-19 continues to rage throughout the country, hitting minority communities the hardest. In a week that focused on “reopening the economy,” everyone has become keenly aware that there is more than one pandemic affecting U.S. lives and local economies. As the American Psychological Association has declared, “we are living in a racism pandemic” too. World leaders are weighing in. The United Nations has urged action from U.S. authorities. No matter your racial, political, or other identity, these events are almost impossible to escape. In particular, millions of Black people and their allies are hurting. And these issues are not ones that organizations or their leaders — from CEOs at the top of the hierarchy to team managers on the frontline — can ignore. While conventional diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives focus on employee engagement and belonging, today’s challenges reach far beyond marginalization in the workplace. We now see and hear Black people who are suffering from the weight of dehumanizing injustice and the open wound of racism that has been festering for centuries. Black leaders like Robert Sellers, the University of Michigan’s vice provost for equity and inclusion and chief diversity officer, are openly sharing their feelings of exasperation. Blogs like Danielle Cadet’s caution readers that “Your black colleagues may look like they’re okay – chances are they’re not.” Another social media message that has gone viral really struck us: “There are black men and women in Zoom meetings maintaining ‘professionalism,’ biting their tongues, holding back tears and swallowing rage, while we endure attacks from a pandemic and police. Understand and be mindful.” The psychological impact of these public events — and the way it carries over into the workplace — cannot be overstated. Research shows that how organizations respond to large-scale, diversity-related events that receive significant media attention can either help employees feel psychologically safe or contribute to racial identity threat and mistrust of institutions of authority. Without adequate support, minority employees are likely to perceive their environments as more interpersonally and institutionally biased against them. Leaders seeking to create an inclusive environment for everyone must find ways to address these topics. First, we’d like to outline three common missteps to avoid. Keeping silent. For people not directly impacted by these events, the default response is often silence. Many Whites avoid talking about race because they fear being seen as prejudiced, so they adopt strategic colorblindness instead. We know that many managers also think they lack the skills to have difficult conversations around differences. But no one has the perfect words to address atrocities in our society. It is the leader’s responsibility to try, conveying care and concern for all employees but especially targeted groups. As Desmond Tutu once said, “If you are neutral in the situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” You might be tempted to rest on the laurels of your organizations’ diversity statements and active employee resource groups. But that is not enough. The words of Dr. Martin Luther King remind us: “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.” Becoming overly defensive. Another common misstep when approaching uncomfortable conversations about racial injustice is to react defensively, especially when our world views, positions, or advantages are questioned or challenged. Robin DiAngelo’s research on white fragility highlights this phenomenon. For instance, when learning about police brutality against unarmed Black people, one reaction might be to search for evidence about what the victim did to deserve abuse, rather than demonstrating compassion and empathy. Another example is diminishing protesters by focusing on and judging those who engaged in looting instead of discussing the unjust act that drove people to the streets. Leaders must resist such reactions because they do not allow for constructive engagement. Instead, they make members of targeted groups feel even more alienated. Remember that comments on systemic inequalities are not personal attacks. Overgeneralizing. When triggering events occur, there is a tendency to make sweeping generalizations about groups of people involved in the public conflict. Though individuals of the same race, gender or other identity often have shared experiences, there is diversity within groups that should be recognized. Instead of presuming that all members of your in-group or out-group think and feel similarly and talking about what “everybody knows,” how “all of us feel,” and what “none of us would ever do,” leave room for dissenting points of view. When in doubt, ask employees about their individual experiences to honor their uniqueness. Think about how you can allow your employees to discuss what’s happening without putting them on the spot or asking them to speak for everyone in their identity group. Best Buy’s senior leadership team offered one of the first corporate statements acknowledging the death of George Floyd under a white police officer’s knee in Minnesota, the harassment of bird-watcher Christian Cooper by a white woman in New York City, and the death of jogger Ahmaud Arbery at the hands of armed white gunman in Georgia, while also paying service to the fact that the Black experience in America is not monolithic: “We write about these … events … not because most of us know what this fear must be like. We are as a group, by and large, not people of color. We write this not because most of us have known anyone personally in a situation like this. Thankfully, most of us do not. We write this because it could have been any one of our friends or colleagues at Best Buy, or in our personal lives, lying on the ground, struggling to breathe or filming someone as they threatened us.” Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat acknowledged that many employees have experienced racism in their everyday lives in overt and subtle ways. “I want you to know that your colleagues and I will always stand with you,” he said in a memo to employees. “While I can try to empathize with what it must be like to be a black person in America, I haven’t walked in those shoes.” Next, we’d like to provide a framework for meaningful action. Leaders must not only offer physical and psychological safety. They also have the power and platform to lead change. Statements from the top are valuable, but they are just a start. Anyone, at any level of the organization, can take small steps to exercise greater compassion and initiate action that provides needed support and promotes racial justice for Black workers as well as others who are marginalized. Managers have a particularly important role in connecting with their employees on these issues.  Here’s how: Acknowledge. It’s important to acknowledge any harm that your Black and brown coworkers have endured. This means committing to lifelong learning about racism. Seek the facts about racist events, as well as the aggressions and microagressions that your minority coworkers have most likely faced inside and outside of your organization.  We suggest the following steps: In the organizational setting, you have the power to step up. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and the company’s diversity chief Brian Lamb wrote a memo to U.S. employees stating: “This week’s terrible events in Minneapolis, together with too many others occurring around our country, are tragic and heartbreaking. Let us be clear — we are watching, listening and want every single one of you to know we are committed to fighting against racism and discrimination wherever and however it exists.” At Georgetown University, president John DeGioia wrote a heartfelt message to the community acknowledging the harm of a series of racist events: “On too many occasions over the years, there has been cause for me to share reflections with our community, as we grapple with the devastating impact of racism and hatred in our nation.  In August 2014, following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; in December 2015, following the grand jury decision in the killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York; in August 2017, following the march of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.  In these moments, which encompass far from the full extent of experiences of racism and racist violence, I have tried to frame the work in which we must engage within the mission and purpose of the Academy.” Affirm. People are looking for leaders to affirm their right to safety and personhood and help them feel protected. When presidents, governors, mayors and sheriffs aren’t doing so, corporate, university, and non-profit leaders can. This means offering continued opportunities for reaction, reflection, conversation, growth, development, impact, and advancement. Affirmation can start with creating a space for employees to share. For example, when asked, “How are you today?” many people of color respond in a scripted manner, instead of answering honestly. Instead, use more thoughtful prompts and questions. You might say something like this: “I’ve been thinking about the harm of racism in our country, especially considering recent events.” Next, describe your personal reaction and concerns, then make a commitment. “I’d like to help in promoting equity, so here’s one thing I plan to do to help prevent future tragedies like these.” Explain those intentions. Then, offer to engage. “Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to be supportive, even if you just want to talk about what’s happening. I understand if you don’t, and I won’t be offended. But I just want you to know that the door is open, and that I care.” The last line is important. Not everyone will be interested in or comfortable with discussing racism at work, especially if they haven’t built a solid foundation of trust. Act. Think critically about how you can use your power to effect change. Employees value words of understanding and encouragement, but leaders’ and organizations’ actions have a more lasting impact. We have witnessed some courageous steps, such as Joan Gabel, president of the University of Minnesota, ending contracts with the Minneapolis Police Department after George Floyd’s death. Franklin Templeton Investments fired executive employee Amy Cooper after her interaction with Chris Cooper in Central Park. Georgetown president John DeGioia’s statement went on to say: “Our role in society — to pursue the truth — through the methodologies and disciplines through which we establish knowledge in our world, demands our engagement.  In our response, we have sought to accelerate our academic commitment to addressing racial justice and to address our own connection to the institution of slavery and the enduring legacy of racism and to undo the structural elements that sustain this legacy.” More examples include YouTube pledging $1 million to the Center for Policing Equity, Glossier giving $500,000 to support racial justice organizations and another $500,000 to Black-owned beauty brands, and Peloton not only donating $500,000 to the NAACP but also calling for its members to speak up for and learn ways to practice anti-racism. What can you and your organization do in your community? What would promote equity and justice and activate meaningful change?  Whether you are a senior or junior leader, how can you advocate for such action? Racism isn’t just Black people’s problem; it’s everyone’s problem because it erodes the fabric of society. Leaders at every level must use their power, platforms, and resources to help employees and communities overcome these challenges and build a better world for us all."

Fortunately, there are specific, research-based steps that managers can take without great effort to improve the engagement and productivity of remote employees, even when there is little time to prepare. First, it’s important to understand the common challenges, from isolation to distractions to lack of face-to-face supervision. Then managers can support remote workers with 1) regular, structured check-ins; 2) multiple communication options (and established norms for each; 3) opportunities for social interactions; and 4) ongoing encouragement and emotional support. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. In response to the uncertainties presented by Covid-19, many companies and universities have asked their employees to work remotely. While close to a quarter of the U.S. workforce already works from home at least part of the time, the new policies leave many employees — and their managers — working out of the office and separated from each other for the first time. Although it is always preferable to establish clear remote-work policies and training in advance, in times of crisis or other rapidly changing circumstances, this level of preparation may not be feasible. Fortunately, there are specific, research-based steps that managers can take without great effort to improve the engagement and productivity of remote employees, even when there is little time to prepare. To start, managers need to understand factors that can make remote work especially demanding. Otherwise high-performing employees may experience declines in job performance and engagement when they begin working remotely, especially in the absence of preparation and training. Challenges inherent in remote work include: Lack of face-to-face supervision: Both managers and their employees often express concerns about the lack of face-to-face interaction. Supervisors worry that employees will not work as hard or as efficiently (though research indicates otherwise, at least for some types of jobs). Many employees, on the other hand, struggle with reduced access to managerial support and communication. In some cases, employees feel that remote managers are out of touch with their needs, and thereby are neither supportive nor helpful in getting their work done. Lack of access to information: Newly remote workers are often surprised by the added time and effort needed to locate information from coworkers. Even getting answers to what seem like simple questions can feel like a large obstacle to a worker based at home. This phenomenon extends beyond task-related work to interpersonal challenges that can emerge among remote coworkers. Research has found that a lack of “mutual knowledge” among remote workers translates to a lower willingness to give coworkers the benefit of the doubt in difficult situations. For example, if you know that your officemate is having a rough day, you will view a brusque email from them as a natural product of their stress. However, if you receive this email from a remote coworker, with no understanding of their current circumstances, you are more likely to take offense, or at a minimum to think poorly of your coworker’s professionalism. Social isolation: Loneliness is one of the most common complaints about remote work, with employees missing the informal social interaction of an office setting. It is thought that extraverts may suffer from isolation more in the short run, particularly if they do not have opportunities to connect with others in their remote-work environment. However, over a longer period of time, isolation can cause any employee to feel less “belonging” to their organization, and can even result in increased intention to leave the company. Distractions at home: We often see photos representing remote work which portray a parent holding a child and typing on a laptop, often sitting on a sofa or living-room floor. In fact, this is a terrible representation of effective virtual work. Typically, we encourage employers to ensure that their remote workers have both dedicated workspace and adequate childcare before allowing them to work remotely. Yet, in the case of a sudden transition to virtual work, there is a much greater chance that employees will be contending with suboptimal workspaces and (in the case of school and daycare closures) unexpected parenting responsibilities. Even in normal circumstances family and home demands can impinge on remote work; managers should expect these distractions to be greater during this unplanned work-from-home transition. As much as remote work can be fraught with challenges, there are also relatively quick and inexpensive things that managers can do to ease the transition. Actions that you can take today include: Establish structured daily check-ins: Many successful remote managers establish a daily call with their remote employees.  This could take the form of a series of one-on-one calls, if your employees work more independently from each other, or a team call, if their work is highly collaborative. The important feature is that the calls are regular and predictable, and that they are a forum in which employees know that they can consult with you, and that their concerns and questions will be heard. Provide several different communication technology options: Email alone is insufficient. Remote workers benefit from having a “richer” technology, such as video conferencing, that gives participants many of the visual cues that they would have if they were face-to-face. Video conferencing has many advantages, especially for smaller groups: Visual cues allow for increased “mutual knowledge” about coworkers and also help reduce the sense of isolation among teams. Video is also particularly useful for complex or sensitive conversations, as it feels more personal than written or audio-only communication. There are other circumstances when quick collaboration is more important than visual detail. For these situations, provide mobile-enabled individual messaging functionality (like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.) which can be used for simpler, less formal conversations, as well as time-sensitive communication. If your company doesn’t have technology tools already in place, there are inexpensive ways to obtain simple versions of these tools for your team, as a short-term fix.  Consult with your organization’s IT department to ensure there is an appropriate level of data security before using any of these tools. And then establish “rules of engagement”: Remote work becomes more efficient and satisfying when managers set expectations for the frequency, means, and ideal timing of communication for their teams. For example, “We use videoconferencing for daily check-in meetings, but we use IM when something is urgent.” Also, if you can, let your employees know the best way and time to reach you during the workday (e.g., “I tend to be more available late in the day for ad hoc phone or video conversations, but if there’s an emergency earlier in the day, send me a text.”) Finally, keep an eye on communication among team members (to the extent appropriate), to ensure that they are sharing information as needed. We recommend that managers establish these “rules of engagement” with employees as soon as possible, ideally during the first online check-in meeting. While some choices about specific expectations may be better than others, the most important factor is that all employees share the same set of expectations for communication. Provide opportunities for remote social interaction: One of the most essential steps a manager can take is to structure ways for employees to interact socially (that is, have informal conversations about non-work topics) while working remotely. This is true for all remote workers, but particularly so for workers who have been abruptly transitioned out of the office. The easiest way to establish some basic social interaction is to leave some time at the beginning of team calls just for non-work items (e.g., “We’re going to spend the first few minutes just catching up with each other. How was your weekend?”). Other options include virtual pizza parties (in which pizza is delivered to all team members at the time of a videoconference), or virtual office parties (in which party “care packages” can be sent in advance to be opened and enjoyed simultaneously). While these types of events may sound artificial or forced, experienced managers of remote workers (and the workers themselves) report that virtual events help reduce feelings of isolation, promoting a sense of belonging. Offer encouragement and emotional support: Especially in the context of an abrupt shift to remote work, it is important for managers to acknowledge stress, listen to employees’ anxieties and concerns, and empathize with their struggles. If a newly remote employee is clearly struggling but not communicating stress or anxiety, ask them how they’re doing. Even a general question such as “How is this remote work situation working out for you so far?” can elicit important information that you might not otherwise hear. Once you ask the question, be sure to listen carefully to the response, and briefly restate it back to the employee, to ensure that you understood correctly. Let the employee’s stress or concerns (rather than your own) be the focus of this conversation. Research on emotional intelligence and emotional contagion tells us that employees look to their managers for cues about how to react to sudden changes or crisis situations. If a manager communicates stress and helplessness, this will have what Daniel Goleman calls a “trickle-down” effect on employees. Effective leaders take a two-pronged approach, both acknowledging the stress and anxiety that employees may be feeling in difficult circumstances, but also providing affirmation of their confidence in their teams, using phrases such as “we’ve got this,” or “this is tough, but I know we can handle it,” or “let’s look for ways to use our strengths during this time.” With this support, employees are more likely to take up the challenge with a sense of purpose and focus.

Nearly half of employees are concerned their employers will bring them back to work before it’s safe, and more than half worry about the future of the company they work for — and their job specifically. The anxiety generated by these circumstances can produce fatigue, concentration problems, increased use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, and worsening of existing health conditions — all of which have the potential to negatively impact work performance. Drawing on their experience as people, culture and change consultants, the authors identified five things employers must do to help reduce employee re-entry and anxiety: 1) Make employee well-being your top priority; 2) Share accurate, timely, and transparent information; 3) Take swift action to implement recommended public health measures; 4) Train leaders, managers, and colleagues on how to support employees; and 5) Offer employee flexibility. We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. As many states are giving the green light to reopen, employers are developing plans to bring employees back to work safely, giving careful thought to schedules, seating configurations, visitor policies, elevator usage, food delivery, and much more. While workforce reentry certainly includes logistical and operational planning, it is not just physical well-being that employers must take into account. Equally important is how organizations will respond to employees’ emotional and psychological health —a topic that, regrettably, is discussed far less frequently. Anxiety is near-universal right now — a natural reaction to unnatural circumstances and an uncertain future. Nearly half of employees are concerned that their employers will bring them back to work before it’s safe, according to a national survey by Weber Shandwick and KRC Research. More than half worry about the future of the company they work for — and their job specifically. If employers don’t address these sources of anxiety and assist employees in managing their mental health, bringing people back to work will do little to help companies return to pre-Covid productivity and engagement levels. Many companies will need to enhance current practices, supplementing external or third-party mental health programs with a greater capacity to deal with stress, anxiety, and uncertainty “in house.” This does not mean attempting to take the place of trained mental health practitioners but rather building greater internal awareness of, sensitivity toward, and ability to address employee concerns. Drawing on our many years of experience as people, culture, and change consultants, we’ve identified five things employers must do to help reduce employee reentry anxiety. The five indicators can serve both as a framework to help employers build their reentry plans and as measures by which to assess progress. Employees want reassurance that their companies will put their people first whenever possible, especially in difficult times.  Costco’s decision to institute hazard pay for frontline workers, Apple’s move to offer paid sick days, and Delta CEO Ed Bastian’s choice to forgo his salary for six months are early examples of corporate values in action that helped relieve employee concerns. Most employers receive good marks from their people for the way they’ve responded to the pandemic thus far. Large majorities in our survey said that their employer is putting safety above profits (72%) and taking care of employees as best they can (74%) and that their employers’ response is “exactly what it should be” (72%). Companies must continue demonstrating commitment to their values during the reentry phase. They would do well to take a cue from Jane Fraser, president of Citi & CEO of Global Consumer Banking, who made Citi’s reentry priority abundantly clear when she wrote on LinkedIn: “As #Citi plans for the future — re-opening our offices and determining what our new workplace needs will be — one thing is very clear to us. We will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees, customers and communities. That may mean being more cautious than the guidance of a city, state or country. We have a senior and seasoned team working on our return to the office to ensure that when we do so, it is done intelligently and with the health and well-being of our people at the center of our decision making.” A consistent cadence of communications from your CEO or other trusted leaders is key to managing employee anxiety. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has become one of the most trusted sources in the country for Covid-19 guidance because of his transparent and regular briefings. Not surprisingly, our research shows that employees who regularly receive updates from their companies are more likely to have positive views of their employers. They are more likely to be proud to work for their companies (by 55%) and to look forward to going back to work (by 43%). A pattern of open two-way communication is especially critical as employers take actions to deal with the pandemic’s economic impact. Organizations that have kept employees abreast of business performance and engaged in ongoing dialogue with their people will be better prepared for difficult conversations. Our research found that employees trust top public health experts, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Dr. Anthony Fauci, on reentry timelines. Fewer than one in 10 would feel safe returning to the office when only their employer says it’s safe. Employees’ top five safety requests closely match CDC and others’ recommendations. Employees want their employers to: Employees need to know how these measures are being implemented, what the timeline is, and how the measures will be monitored and enforced. They also need assurance that steps are being taken to update protocols and processes as the situation evolves. Leaders and managers will shoulder much of the responsibility for ensuring a smooth return to the workplace. Some of our clients are considering holding mandatory virtual “reentry boot camps” for them, focused on topics such as dealing with ambiguity, building personal resilience, developing emotional intelligence, and leading hybrid teams. Armed with insights into these areas, managers can model needed behaviors and share them with their teams to support new ways of working. People managers will need to take greater responsibility for employees’ well-being. This includes familiarizing themselves with the warning signs of emotional distress, factoring more time into their days for checking in with staff, helping team members understand what is and isn’t within their control, and learning how to triage real-time issues while other resources are called upon to help. Anxiety will be further reduced as employees reengage with their colleagues through informal and formal support networks.  Quarantining and social distancing have meant that people have lost the very support systems and coping mechanisms that would otherwise have helped them weather the storm. All employees can initiate forums for reconnecting with one another (virtually or physically, from six feet away) with empathy and compassion as they adapt to their new normal. Our large-scale work-from-home experiment has shown that at least for some industries, it is possible to get work done not only remotely but on a variety of schedules that best accommodate people’s preferred working hours and personal commitments. As workplaces reopen, employers can expect pressure to maintain this flexibility, particularly from team members caring for children or sick loved ones. Many may wonder, “If I can’t return to a pre-Covid work situation, will I be viewed as not fully committed or, worse, lose my job?” Employers who wish to reduce anxiety can discuss and align on how to handle these issues now. They should consider the following questions: In all the planning to keep employees physically safe, let’s not forget the impact of Covid-19 on their psychological health. The anxiety generated by these circumstances can produce fatigue, concentration problems, increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, and worsening of existing health conditions, all of which have the potential to negatively impact work performance.  Taking these five actions is the right thing to do, but that’s not the only reason to get behind them. Employers’ attention or inattention to all aspects of their employees’ well-being during this chapter will have reputational consequences for many years to come.

"86",86,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/looking-for-new-global-markets-bigger-isnt-always-better","marketing.txt","As your company develops a market expansion strategy, what’s the best way to evaluate different global opportunities and determine which makes the most sense for your business? It can be tempting to simply focus on the largest markets, but that approach doesn’t account for several important factors. In this piece, the author shares a three-part framework to help any company develop a targeted expansion strategy. Specifically, for each potential market, businesses should determine the Market Availability (the size of the market), Real-Time Analytics (current traction in that market), and Customer Addressability (ease of entry into that market based on your current product offerings). By balancing each of these three considerations and carefully considering each market opportunity one at a time, you can make an informed decision and move forward into these new markets with confidence. When I joined HubSpot in 2015, we already had customers in more than 100 countries all around the world. Nevertheless, our international expansion plans were far from complete. To determine which countries would require longer-term investments, and which had the potential to offer us faster near-term growth, we developed a three-part framework that can help any company to develop a more targeted expansion strategy: Source: Nataly Kelly This framework, which we call the MARACA model, consists of three metrics that companies should consider when evaluating a potential market: To implement this framework, we assigned each potential market a score for each of the three components, on a scale of one to ten. Think of it like Olympic scoring: a 10-10-10 score would mean a perfect market, but, as in Olympic games, a perfect score is exceedingly rare. So what does this look like in practice? Consider a fictional U.S.-based B2B company that’s developing an international expansion strategy. To start, they would evaluate their home market as a baseline. It’s likely that the U.S. would be one of their largest possible markets due to the sheer number of businesses across the country that could be potential customers, so it gets a 10 out of 10 for market availability (MA). The company currently performs best in the U.S., so it would also score a 10 out of 10 for real-time analytics (RA). And the business is optimized for American customers — they sell in USD, address customers in American English, and have good evidence that they truly understand their local customer’s needs — so they would achieve a 10 out of 10 in customer addressability (CA) as well. Overall, the U.S. market would get a perfect score of 10-10-10, meaning that it has opportunity, traction, and good product-market fit. Next, the company would consider various potential markets to target for expansion. Let’s say that two of their top contenders are Finland and Sweden. How would the MARACA framework be applied to compare the two opportunities? Finland and Sweden are fairly similar markets as far as size goes. If our fictional company wants to sell to small- and medium-sized businesses, both countries would score similarly in terms of market availability (MA), because they both have a similar number of target companies (especially when compared to much larger European economies, such as France or Germany). Next, as a U.S.-based company with limited global traction, both markets would receive similarly low real-time analytics (RA) scores, so that metric would also be unlikely to provide much guidance. Finally, as far as customer addressability (CA), the two markets might again seem similar. Both countries have strong economies, high ease of doing business, and similar levels of English proficiency. However, Finland would get a higher CA score for one simple reason: the company already accepts their currency (the Euro), while it is not set up to accept the Swedish Krona. Although many Swedish businesses pay bills in other currencies, this limitation would likely impact the company’s ability to sell into the market quickly and easily. Another factor that can affect a market’s CA score is the country’s level of technology adoption. Finland, which is ranked by the European Commission as the most digitally advanced nation in Europe, is often targeted by tech companies for this reason. Its strong culture of early technology adoption — stemming from a high cost of living, small population, and lack of local competitors — makes it easier to penetrate for many of these companies. These types of factors can be subtle and difficult to quantify, but they are extremely important to consider. The main value of the MARACA model is that it forces you to look closely at how you would perform in each market, one at a time, at the micro level. Instead of thinking in generalities across entire regions or group of countries, it helps you to understand your company’s weaknesses and opportunities in each local market. Ultimately, this analysis gives you what you need to better control your international growth; you can reduce investment in low-potential markets and focus on investing in countries that are likely to offer faster traction. In addition to helping you choose the best markets for expansion, this framework can provide a direction for product development efforts. While MA is relatively static for a given market, you have significant control over CA, which can in turn boost your RA. If the MARACA model identifies a poor product fit in an otherwise strong market, you can change your product positioning, pricing, or packaging — or even create an entirely new product. This might involve  localizing your offerings, opening an in-country office, or acquiring local partners. Of course, the lower your CA score for a given market, the more work you’ll need to do — so it’s important to consider whether the MA and RA scores are high enough to justify the cost. In some cases, it may be possible to achieve the same or even higher revenue with a fraction of the investment by simply focusing on the low-hanging fruit available in markets that are smaller, but easier to penetrate. *** There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to international growth. The nuances of your business and the industry you’re in, as well as your company’s strategic direction, will help to shape your expansion into new markets. Moreover, those factors change over time. Your international business — as well as the strategic model that informs it — should both be dynamic. Over the course of my time at HubSpot, our international expansion has evolved as we’ve acquired more data, learned more about our customers, and deepened our understanding of each local market. Whether you’re just starting to branch out of your home market or you’re already a ways down the path of international expansion, this framework can help you think through your options, compare the requirements for succeeding in different parts of the world, and ultimately, make data-driven, strategic decisions that enable you to move forward with confidence."
"87",87,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/case-study-when-your-brand-is-racist","marketing.txt","Shawn Lewis kept one eye on his laptop while footage of the protests in support of Black Lives Matter flashed across the TV. His family was asleep, but he was waiting for a press release draft from his colleague Angela that would go out tomorrow. Angela Howell was the head of PR at Cork Beverages, a brewing and distilling company based in Nashville, where Shawn was a senior brand manager. The release concerned the brand he was responsible for: Overseer Whiskey.   When Slack finally dinged, he opened the attached document: We recognize that Overseer Whiskey’s history and name are closely tied to our country’s history of racism. While we have worked over the years to update the brand to be respectful of all races, those changes have not been enough. We are evaluating further measures and will announce our plans soon. Cork Beverages believes in diversity, equity, and inclusion and wants our product portfolio to reflect that commitment. In addition, we are donating $3 million to organizations that support and engage the Black community.1 Angela followed up a few minutes later. “Any changes?” He wrote back: “I’m still worried it’s vague. Is it enough to say that we’re evaluating changes?” “Jim doesn’t want to back the company into a corner,” she replied. Cork’s CEO, Jim Worth, was known for hedging his bets on strategic decisions. “But I agree that we need to get out in front of this thing. We don’t want to come off as reactive.” Shawn wondered if they were already too late. Over the past several weeks, many brands had been called out for their racist product names or histories. He was getting hourly alerts from Google indicating that searches for “Overseer” were increasing. It felt like a matter of time before a tweet pointing out the brand’s troubling past went viral.2 Samuel Vernon, a distiller and plantation owner in Tennessee, had started making the whiskey in the early 19th century. According to brand lore, he named it Overseer after an enslaved man whom he promoted to foreman of his cornfield, a highly unconventional act at the time. Throughout the 1800s and well into the 1900s, ads for the brand depicted a smiling Black man in field clothes and a broad hat, carrying a long stick. When Cork bought the whiskey brand, in the 1950s, it redesigned the label to feature Vernon’s home instead. Over the past 40 years, as Overseer became a household name across the United States, Cork had downplayed the image of the plantation house, making it smaller on each version of the label. The company avoided advertising for the product, relying more on reputation and word of mouth. But Overseer remained Cork’s best seller, and the senior team didn’t want to tinker too much with a winning brand. Shawn had taken over as brand manager for Overseer three years earlier. He was well aware that putting a Black man in charge of a brand with racist origins worked in Cork’s favor, especially in an industry not known for its diversity. But whatever the motivation for his promotion, he wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity to lead the company’s crown jewel. He felt pressure to get it right, not just for Cork, but for himself. Rereading the press release, he was proud that he’d persuaded the board to make a meaningful contribution to Black causes.3 Angela pinged him again. “I just heard from Carla that she’s good with the press release as is. Do I have your sign-off?” He trusted Carla Tasha, his boss and Cork’s chief marketing officer. If she’d signed off, he could too. He knew she’d have his back if things went sideways. “Yup, all good,” he typed. As he hit send, he thought to himself, Now my work really begins. This will be the biggest challenge of my career. Shawn’s first Zoom call the next morning was with Carla and Eric Reid, the head of finance for Cork’s spirits division. “Let’s start with a review of our options,” Carla said. The idea of altering the Overseer brand had been on the table for some time; in fact, Cork had conducted extensive customer research to gauge perceptions of the brand and potential reactions to changes.4 Shawn and his team had been strong advocates for dealing with the brand’s racist origins even before George Floyd was brutally killed by the police and the national dialogue around racism exploded. They’d hoped to execute a plan without fanfare, but the board had been reluctant to make a move, fearing a revenue hit for Cork’s best-selling brand. Now their hand was being forced. “If we really wanted to make a clean break,” Shawn said, “we’d kill the Overseer line. I realize it’s highly unlikely, but I have to mention it.” “Kill our most profitable brand?” Eric asked with eyebrows raised. “No one’s going to take that seriously.” “I agree,” said Carla, “though it would make a strong statement.” “It would also piss off our customers,” Eric pointed out, “especially in the Southeast and the Midwest. We know from our market research that they have no problem with the name or the history. Only 42% of our whiskey drinkers even know what an overseer is.” 5 “True, our customer data shows that most people don’t associate the brand with slavery,” Shawn said. “But if we want to do more than avoid a potential PR crisis and put Cork out there as a leader in the fight against racism, getting rid of Overseer will do that. But it’s probably a nonstarter, so let’s move on.” As Shawn discussed developing a new brand around the same taste profile, he heard Carla sigh. Having been in marketing her entire career, she had numerous war stories of failed rebranding efforts. She’d never been in favor of a complete rebranding, and given the price tag, neither had Eric or his boss, Cork’s CFO. “Then we’ve got the option of tweaking the brand,” Shawn said. “We change the name but not so much that we lose brand recognition. In customer testing, the names ‘Seer’ and ‘Chattanooga Seer’ scored the best.” 6 Shawn shared his screen and walked them through the key takeaways from the research. “This is helpful,” Carla said. “And what about rebranding as ‘Element’?” Another option was to fold Overseer into Cork’s second-most popular brand, Element Gin, and call it Element Whiskey. “That’s still on the table,” Shawn said. “You’ll also present a ‘no changes’ scenario to the board?” Eric asked. “You know they’ll bring it up.” Overseer had dominated whiskey sales in every region of the country for the past two decades, and thanks to limited discounting and minimal advertising, it was very profitable. “Why would we throw that away?” was a constant refrain from a few board members. Like Eric, they pointed out that most customers didn’t seem to know or care about the link to slavery. “I know our research was done before George Floyd’s death,” Eric said, “but so far there hasn’t been a public outcry, and sales are actually up—pandemic drinking, I guess.” Shawn knew that Eric liked to play devil’s advocate. “You really think doing nothing is an option after that press release?” 7 Eric nodded. “I do. Look, I’m not advocating for that, but you should be ready for pushback from the board. Nobody in that room is ready to kill the cash cow.” “That’s been true for a long time, but the calculus has changed,” Carla said.8 “I bet they’ll be very interested in what you have to say, Shawn.” Her implication was clear. Because he was Black, the board might listen more seriously to his recommendation on how to handle the situation. “Besides, you know the brand and our consumers better than anyone.” The next day, Shawn and his three direct reports met on Zoom to go over the board presentation. He began by asking where each of them stood on the options before they dove into the data. “I’ll go last,” he said. Chrystal laughed. “You always say that!” It was true; Shawn had learned from a mentor that when you’re the most powerful person in the room, the quickest way to sway a conversation is to share your opinion first. Becca jumped in. “I’ve always been firmly in the Element camp. It won’t be an easy transition, but if the halo effect is real, we could recoup the cost of rebranding and return to current sales levels within a year, if not the same level of profitability. Cork has built equity in the Element brand—now we need to leverage it.” “I think the projections from finance on the Element option are overly optimistic,” Chrystal said. “Remember the focus groups?” Shawn thought back to how frustrating those discussions had been. No matter how carefully his team explained that Element Whiskey would be the exact same recipe made in the same way in the same distillery, just with a different name and label, the participants refused to believe that it would taste the same. “The other risk is damaging our gin brand by dragging it into the situation,” Chrystal added. “Ken, you’re quiet,” Shawn said, looking at him on the screen. “Yeah, let’s hear the argument for no changes again,” Chrystal teased. Ken always went back to the data: Most customers associated the brand with “authority” and “assertiveness,” not antebellum slavery. But Ken surprised them. “I’ve actually done a 180 on this,” he said. “I’m leaning toward a new brand. It’s an expensive undertaking, but if there ever was a time to get senior management and our customers on board, it’s now. We need to think about social impact as much as profit here.” 9 “Isn’t that what the $3 million donation is for?” Chrystal asked. “Social impact?” “But is it enough?” Ken asked. After dinner that night, Shawn sat down on the couch next to his father, Arden, who’d moved in with Shawn’s family right after the pandemic started to shut everything down. He was a widower, and no one wanted him to quarantine alone. And as a retired school principal, Arden had been able to help Shawn’s children with online classes. “Dad, you pouring?” Though neither was a big drinker, during the months-long lockdown, they’d begun a nightly ritual of having a snifter of whiskey together. “Good thing you get this free,” Arden said, smiling and holding up the almost empty bottle of Overseer. Shawn smiled back fondly. His dad always supported him. At every milestone—business school graduation, his wedding, his promotion at Cork—Arden had said the same thing: “I respect the choices you’ve made, Shawn.” He wanted to make his dad proud. As they both sipped quietly, his phone buzzed. “Duty calls,” Arden joked. It was an email from Carla: “Just got off the phone with Jim. We’ve got to move fast on this. Things are heating up, and we will want to announce plans soon. How close is your team to making a recommendation?”  Shawn should discontinue the Overseer brand and immediately build a new one from scratch. While Carla is right that rebranding has a hefty price tag, this is a “pay now or pay later” situation. Consumers are savvy, and many will easily discover Overseer’s racist backstory. In particular, Millennials and Gen Z—the fastest-growing customer segments—are often unwilling to associate with brands that conflict with their values. Cork needs to make the investment in rebranding now to avoid losing current and future customers. A full rejection of Overseer would allow the company to demonstrate its values and commitment to diversity. Yes, Shawn will have to answer to the CEO, the board, and other stakeholders, including the bottlers and distillers, but he can be confident that this courageous move won’t hurt the bottom line over the long run. In fact, it’ll do the opposite. Shawn and his team can start by figuring out what the new brand story should be. I’d aim for something with a positive, nothing-to-hide spirit that emphasizes freedom and equality. The other options seem untenable. Tweaking the name or pulling the product under the Element brand will feel like a smoke screen—as if Cork is trying to hide the fact that the brand was built on the back of an enslaved Black man. Customers will see through that, just as they might question whether the $3 million donation to Black communities is enough. From the Washington Redskins to Eskimo Pies, many brands are recognizing that reckoning with a problematic past takes a lot more than onetime financial gestures or image tweaks. Bold moves are far more effective. Think of the way Ben & Jerry’s denounced white supremacy after George Floyd’s killing. There was no doubt in anyone’s mind where the company stood; its leaders didn’t care if they lost customers because of it. Cork should take a lesson from that book, communicating openly that it was in the wrong and is taking action—before being asked to. I feel empathy for Shawn. As a Black man leading a brand with a racist history, he’s in a difficult position. While I haven’t been in exactly the same situation, I’ve been asked to work for organizations whose values clashed with mine: cigarette companies that targeted inner-city youth and fast-food chains led by founders who held racist views. And I used those opportunities to make clear what I stand for. When you’re given a megaphone, do something positive with it. That’s what Shawn needs to do. He can fulfill his commitments to Cork, his family, and society by blowing up the brand and giving it a fresh, aspirational start. Overseer’s brand needs to be tweaked; that can’t even be up for debate. But I don’t see a reason to destroy the brand entirely. As the CFO suggests, Cork could do nothing, but that would almost certainly limit its whiskey’s appeal to an ever-smaller segment of customers as modern societal norms prompt people to avoid products with problematic pasts. Cork’s leaders clearly understand that Overseer has a brand problem, and they’ve been distancing themselves from its past for decades. Just because 42% of whiskey drinkers don’t know that the word “overseer” has connections to slavery isn’t a reason to do nothing. At the same time, Shawn and his team need to remember that people enjoy the whiskey, and they should do what they can to hold on to that positive association. By tweaking the name—perhaps to one of the suggestions that have done well in market testing—they can build on what’s working and move away from what’s not. Part of the problem in this case seems to be the internal decision-making process. Carla implies that the board will take Shawn’s recommendations more seriously now, which indicates unconscious bias could be at play. The directors should have been open to Shawn’s advice all along, since he knows the brand better than anyone else. Why weren’t they? Had Cork really been committed to hearing from all employees regardless of race? Had there been a culture of silence where it wasn’t OK to suggest a name change? The company’s leaders need to address these cultural issues as they consider the brand tweaks. This case hit close to home, for sure. As I write this, our company, Dixie Brewery, is in the process of retiring its 113-year-old name; we plan to announce a replacement brand in October. We’re doing this not because there has been a public outcry or demand for change but because we’re increasingly cognizant that the word “Dixie” has been co-opted over the years to mean something other than what our brand represents. Our brand is “New Orleans in a bottle”; it’s a symbol of survival. After Hurricane Katrina, we had to move production out of Louisiana, but this past January we returned home to New Orleans East, and our loyal customers rallied around us. With aspirations to be a national brand, we started reaching out to wholesalers in other states but heard concerns about our name and how it would translate outside the U.S. South. Like Shawn’s market research, ours shows that not everyone believes the Dixie name is offensive. Our friends in the Black community told us that even if they weren’t necessarily offended, they couldn’t defend the name. And we don’t want to either. We want to make a product that brings people together, not one that pulls them apart. We’ve engaged local PR firms and are in the process of conducting focus groups with various sets of customers. With their help, we will test product and brand names until we land on one that feels right for us and what we stand for. This is what Shawn and his team need to do. They already have options that they know resonate with their target customers. They need to lean on the board to finally abandon the status quo. The brand is impaired, and a name change is the only way to save it. 1 In an August survey by Pew Research, 52% of U.S. adults said it was important that companies make public statements about political or social issues, while 48% said it wasn’t important. 2 What are the advantages of making changes to a potentially offensive brand proactively rather than doing so in response to customer complaints? 3 Do donations make an impact, or are they a form of “virtue signaling,” whereby a firm says it’s taking action without making real change? 4 What other stakeholders should Cork involve in this process? 5 Does the fact that the term “overseer” has several meanings make using it in this way OK? 6 Many firms successfully rebrand by using a shorter name or acronym. For example, LG started out as Lucky Goldstar. 7 Researchers liken rebranding to Darwin’s “evolve or die” theory. Do some brands reach a point where they can no longer adapt to changes in their environment? 8 In the wake of recent protests, companies that have long resisted calls to alter their brands—namely, Aunt Jemima, Mrs. Butterworth’s, Uncle Ben’s, and Cream of Wheat—have promised to make changes. 9 How important is it to make a business case for the change? Should a moral argument suffice? Joseph C. Miller is a professor of sales and marketing at St. Ambrose University. Michael A.

This has altered customer needs, accelerated the entry of new types of competitors, and generated novel opportunities for value creation. It has also transformed how the function must work, requiring that it become more agile, interdependent, and accountable for driving firm growth. The authors provide a framework to help leaders identify the organizational design and capabilities needed to build a competitive, next-generation marketing function. Their framework has been used to guide marketing transformations at companies across industries, including consumer packaged goods, transportation, financial services, and retail. Leaders are finding it difficult to think clearly about the role of the marketing function and are anxious about its performance. Yet their efforts to transform marketing have at times been stymied by the lack of a clear methodology for defining its job and designing its work. The authors offer a practical framework for clarifying how marketing can contribute to company growth by delivering distinctive types of value to customers and to the organization itself. Companies across industries have applied this framework to reveal the gap between their existing and needed areas of focus; to determine which capabilities to develop, which to sustain at their current level, and which to scale down, outsource, or automate; and to redesign their marketing functions to deliver on a new value proposition. Marketing has never been more complex. Sweeping  advances in technology have revolutionized and fragmented the discipline, while societal issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the climate crisis have raised expectations for marketers’ social performance. This combination of diverse forces has transformed how the marketing function must work, requiring that it become more agile, interdependent, and accountable for driving company growth.   It’s no wonder that leaders are uncertain about marketing’s role and anxious about its performance. Our survey of marketing managers at 493 companies found that just 20% of those in traditional corporations are satisfied with the effectiveness of their departments; the percentage is only marginally higher among those in digital-native companies. With the support of the Mobile Marketing Association and in collaboration with Peter Schelstraete, formerly the global vice president of digital and assets at Coca-Cola, we spent two years studying the change in marketing organizations. We conducted in-depth interviews with 125 senior marketing leaders across industries to understand the problem and to learn how they were adapting their organizations to compete in this new environment. Most of them, we found, strategically invested in marketing activities, technologies, and structures in order to capitalize on new growth opportunities. Yet many of their efforts to transform marketing organizations were complicated by the lack of a structured methodology. To create a practical framework that companies could use, we started by identifying the ways in which a marketing function can contribute to company growth. That led us to define six broad areas of value. We then developed an inventory of 72 marketing capabilities, spanning both new and foundational tasks, that are needed to create that value. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive compendium of its kind. With input from a steering committee composed of 10 chief marketing officers of leading companies, we then created the analytic process presented here. It can be used to define a marketing value proposition, select the necessary capabilities, and design a competitive next-generation function. Our model has now guided marketing transformations at digital-native and traditional companies across industries, including consumer packaged goods, transportation, financial services, and retail. We found that marketing leaders struggle with transformation efforts for three key reasons. First, they often look at the transformation as an exercise in retooling technology or reshaping structures rather than rethinking how a changing environment can enable the function to create new types of value. Second, they commonly frame transformation projects as a transition from one state to another—for example, from brand to performance marketing or, simply, old to new. That mindset can inhibit synergies between traditional and current marketing practices, splinter teams, and distract from a focus on customers. Third, leaders often allow modernization efforts to be dispersed across teams or functional areas without a holistic operating framework. As a result, various groups may be pursuing distinct and uncoordinated change initiatives, fragmenting value-creation efforts, and undermining marketing’s ability to drive growth. The Covid-19 pandemic has raised expectations for marketers’ social performance. Without a clear, value-based goal for marketing and a strategy for determining the capabilities needed to achieve it, new technologies, structures, and processes are unlikely to deliver substantial improvements in performance. Our framework provides both the goal and the strategy. It divides the six kinds of value created into two categories: value for customers and value for the company. Understanding this taxonomy is the first step in articulating your marketing value proposition and the starting point for aligning marketing’s activities with the company’s growth strategy. In the effort to attract, acquire, and retain customers, a marketing team can create value for them in three areas: exchange, experience, and engagement. Marketers create this kind of value when they effectively match their offerings to specific customer needs. That requires recognizing when customers are looking for a particular product or service, understanding what problem they are trying to solve, and figuring out what offerings will suit them best—in real time. It calls for sharp conversion, personalization, and prediction capabilities. To maximize exchange value, marketers use sophisticated analytics and machine learning to process vast amounts of data on consumer behavior. Allstate, for example, targets dozens of customer types with hundreds of products and tailored messages developed through the use of AI. Alibaba draws on real-time data and continuously fine-tuned learning algorithms to deliver personalized offers to millions of customers. MTailor uses an AI-powered app to measure customers’ fit and deliver customized clothing, and Stitch Fix depends on machine learning to help personalize wardrobe recommendations. The exchange-value-focused CMOs in our study embrace computer science and are emphatic about the importance of AI in shaping the marketing discipline. As one of them put it, “If you can’t have a conversation about pixels or attribution models, you are stuck in the past.” Marketers focused on creating this kind of value work to eliminate hassles and enhance satisfaction across the customer journey. That requires a focus on improving journey orchestration, value augmentation, and offering design through constant innovation. Delta Air Lines, for instance, has become a master at anticipating travelers’ needs and addressing them with customized messages. The airline enhances its core product—the flight—by smoothing the service experience around it, providing advice and information on traffic to and from the airport, in-flight dining choices, boarding status, baggage location, and more. Such service proficiency across the customer journey improves both customer satisfaction and loyalty. Some companies are creating new types of experience value in China by innovatively integrating mobile technology and delivery infrastructures. For example, KFC’s Shanghai stores accept orders via mobile apps and deliver food to long-distance train passengers at their stop of choice. This type of value enhances the “meaning” of a company’s offering—how customers perceive the brand and their relationship with it. Companies increasingly create it by merging traditional techniques such as storytelling and public relations with dynamic content-management systems that facilitate and sometimes automate the design and delivery of real-time messages. They also nurture a sense of community among users and go beyond a product’s traditional functional or emotional benefits to offer societal benefits—for example, by adopting an environmental or social mission. Creating engagement value requires marketers to build purpose and communities, optimize connections, and design stories to strengthen customer relationships. Brands across sectors have embraced social activism in authentic ways: REI, with its focus on environmental stewardship; Always, with its commitment to strengthening self-esteem among young women; and Danone, as a champion of more-sustainable food, to name just a few. All these brands have nurtured active customer involvement with their social efforts. Their work has reinforced meaning, relevance, and trust and led to levels of engagement that would have been difficult to achieve through product-centered efforts alone. Marketers can also increase engagement value by encouraging customers to interact with one another, asking questions, sharing knowledge, and collaborating. To this end, Salesforce created the Trailblazer Community, where customers can join dozens of user groups across industries to share their experiences with the company’s products. Similarly, Glossier, a direct-to-consumer beauty-products brand, facilitates community groups focused on pertinent topics. User groups help these companies understand customer needs, enhance retention, lower acquisition costs, generate product ideas, and smooth the introduction of innovations. For instance, Glossier is exploring social commerce that involves community members who act as influencers and even sell its products. The marketing function can also contribute to growth by generating internal value for a company in three areas: strategic, operational, and knowledge. Marketing teams often spot ways to expand current offerings and guide the development of new offerings and business models. To do this they need the ability to discover growth, build platforms, and leverage assets. Traditionally they focused to a large extent on identifying opportunities for line extensions within a given product category. Today technology allows marketers to help companies enter new categories and even industries as never before. Consider Google’s move into autonomous vehicles. The company has continually expanded its capabilities and brand meaning, enabling it to compete in businesses that its former sector rival Yahoo would be hard-pressed to try. The energy drink Red Bull has likewise broken through category boundaries, creating the successful sports and lifestyle platform Red Bull Media House. Marketing teams can also help companies capture new revenue streams from existing assets or practices—for example, by monetizing marketing data and activities. Amazon’s advertising unit has reported revenue of $10 billion from product sponsorships, placements, the creation of brand-specific stores, and other efforts. Target has created a new revenue stream with Roundel, its recently rebranded media network, which develops content and campaigns for its brand and agency clients, using its own customer data. Caterpillar has placed sensors in more than a million products to generate utilization data services that help large construction and mining companies optimize the maintenance and use of their equipment. Marketing leaders can also play a central role in creating or identifying new business models and technologies that spur customer demand. For example, many large companies—Unilever among them—have established units to manage investments in start-ups and new ventures in emerging marketing technology or entertainment services that, among other things, can help shape product, service, or marketing efforts. Marketing’s role in strengthening a company’s operating effectiveness has never been more important. Yet many marketing leaders struggle with the proliferation of independent and specialized teams engaged in an expanding array of activities across the organization. Because these teams often have divergent methods and views about the role of marketing and its contribution to growth, their work can be hard to integrate. As one of the executives in our study explained, “No technology in the world, no digital marketing, no attribution model, can overcome a lack of alignment across an organization. If one team is measuring success one way and another team is measuring success another way—good luck making it work.” The key here is the ability to improve talent management, enhance organizational links, and strengthen execution methods and technology. Marketing organizations create operational value for a company by aligning disparate teams around a shared growth agenda and marketing approach and increasing their speed, agility, and collaboration. In part that requires constantly upgrading marketing technologies to automate and integrate many aspects of customer relationship management at scale and in real time. We saw three strategies for achieving this. First, effective CMOs establish a clear set of marketing principles and methods—a blueprint for getting the function’s work done. It includes developing shared language and frameworks, understanding how relevant key performance indicators are connected, and creating common accounting standards and flexible decision processes. Second, they foster an organizational culture that focuses on customer needs and more-fluid interactions between areas of expertise. One tool we saw put to that purpose was “key behavioral indicators” (KBIs), such as levels of interpersonal trust and transparency, which were accorded the same status as KPIs in performance evaluations. That’s because when performance on KBIs falls, one CMO told us, the time needed for alignment and coordination increases, reducing speed to market. Samm Escobar Third, these CMOs adopt technologies that help reduce the costs of coordination and collaboration and increase efficiency, transparency, and trust by enabling interaction across teams. Those technologies include project management applications such as Slack, communication platforms, knowledge management systems, and live meeting webcasts to promote inclusion. In its role representing the “voice of the customer,” the marketing function can create knowledge value, principally through the astute use of data science. Some established customer-intelligence activities, such as user-needs assessments and sentiment tracking, remain important. But newer technologies open up further opportunities. For example, AI-powered data analytics systems can increasingly tease out the causal relationship between marketing investments and business outcomes, improving marketing efficiency. The success of such initiatives depends on enhancing data creation and management, leveraging market and customer intelligence, and advancing marketing analytics. In addition, new technologies are enabling ever more innovative ways for companies to capture market signals and use data. For instance, the Freestyle vending machine installed by Coca-Cola across thousands of quick-service restaurants allows customers to select from dozens of flavor mixes, which are individually dispensed. By tracking and reporting these orders, the machines provide granular, real-time, first-party data on consumer preferences: a highly valuable asset for a non-direct-to-consumer firm. The company has used this data to inform its R&D and to launch new products. Samm Escobar As a major producer and user of data, marketing can also create knowledge value by collaborating with IT and data science teams to generate a single source of market intelligence, devise ways to define and measure key marketing metrics, and develop mechanisms for protecting customer information. Adobe executives credit the creation of such a “single source of truth” as a key turning point in accelerating the company’s transformation effort. With a clear understanding of these six broad types of value and the capabilities needed to deliver them, leaders can gauge the importance of each to future growth. That analysis will yield the function’s value proposition—its statement of purpose. Using our framework, a team of marketing leaders and other executives can engage in a series of sessions in which they systematically rate the importance to growth over the coming two or three years of each of the 72 capabilities underpinning the six value areas. For example, they can ask, Within exchange value, how important to growth on a 1 (low) to 10 (high) scale will trend forecasting be? Product personalization? Marketing automation? And so on. Marketing can create knowledge value by collaborating with data science teams. The team can use a discrete-choice method such as conjoint analysis or MaxDiff to analyze data from various stakeholders in determining the relative importance of the types of value. This step helps leaders think clearly about the difference between the value that marketing currently creates and what it should create according to its potential to drive sales, profits, and company growth. For instance, our analyses across 10 industries show that technology-enabled convenience benefits are more important to buyers of services than to buyers of products. In contrast, purpose-related benefits, such as a brand’s stance on social issues, are more important to buyers of consumer packaged goods than to buyers of services. During this exercise it is important to be clear about what’s feasible. We have seen no company become “best in class” in all six areas simultaneously; instead each organization makes careful choices about what it will focus on given its growth goals, industry conditions, competitive environment, and other factors that affect strategy. All companies have constraints related to finances, data availability, and their marketing function’s heritage. The key in refining the marketing value proposition is to determine which subset of value areas marketing can best develop, given its resources and constraints. This exercise reveals where the greatest opportunity to create value lies and what specific capabilities will be needed to realize it. The team can gauge marketing’s readiness to deliver by scoring its current performance on each of the 72 capabilities. (See the sidebar “A Digital Scoring Tool” for how to access a simplified version of our assessment.) When those scores are plotted on a chart, gaps between current capabilities and future needs reveal where the organization should act. The scoring exercise we describe here can be done manually. For a quick introduction to our analytic process, readers can take a simplified version of the online assessment created by our firm, MarCaps, which provides a general score for the fit between a company’s current and necessary marketing capabilities, and benchmarks the organization against others that have used the tool. The assessment is available at www.marcaps.com/research. This analysis won’t yield a mandate for specific change. Rather, it will provide a road map showing a variety of paths that leaders can follow, taking into account the company’s priorities and capabilities. Typically, companies select a subset of areas for investment, considering both the fit level revealed by the analysis and the efforts that will be required to address those areas. Once marketing’s areas of strength and weakness have been identified, it’s clearer which capabilities to develop, which to sustain at their current level, and which to scale down, outsource, or automate. But it’s usually easier for leaders to launch new initiatives or even maintain the status quo than to pull resources from existing activities. In our conversations with CMOs, many talked about the challenge, and the importance, of deciding what not to do, particularly in large organizations where resources and an appetite for exploration may be substantial. This exercise will yield a road map with a variety of paths leaders can follow. Consider how the chief marketing officer of a leading transportation technology firm we worked with applied the framework. She formed a marketing transformation team that included the marketing directors of each geographic region, members of the global marketing organization, and representatives from human resources. In a series of work sessions over six weeks, the team rated the importance to company growth of capabilities within each area and aligned around a value proposition that focused on increasing exchange, engagement, operational, and knowledge value. We then worked with the team to evaluate the current level of each capability and the level needed to help deliver on the new value proposition. In a final work session the leaders made specific choices about their organizational priorities for the following year and where they needed to invest to achieve them. This process underscores the assessment’s role as a form of guidance rather than a strict mandate. Although the analysis revealed opportunities for improvement in each of the value categories the team selected, the group decided not to invest substantially at that time in enhancing strategic value. The CMO and her team clearly saw an opportunity to create that kind of value by finding new sources of revenue, but various organizational constraints suggested that they could reap a higher ROI on their investments in capability building elsewhere. The priorities they selected included prediction and conversion management, storytelling and content personalization, market and customer intelligence, talent enablement, organizational links, data science and analytics, and marketing technology. This new focus led to the formation of the company’s first marketing operations and capability functions, the formalization of a branding team, and the integration of its product and performance marketing activities into the team focused on demand generation. Just as important, the work created a clarity of purpose that provided unified and much-needed direction to the company’s marketing staff. As the CMO put it, “It helped us get aligned within our team and with the executive team on what we needed to be best in the world at, what we needed to be good at, and what we could assign to others.” Marketing leaders have recognized and acted on the need to change their organizations. But most have struggled to carry out changes in ways that advance marketing’s operating effectiveness. The framework presented here brings clarity to the process and guides the design of a marketing organization for our time—one built as a coalition to create value and drive company growth.

"89",89,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/managing-risk-and-resilience","marketing.txt","You’ve probably heard business leaders justify their  flat-footedness in a crisis by claiming that every organization is flying blind in times of deep uncertainty. But in fact some leaders know precisely where they’re going. They understand what’s required to chart a course through market turbulence, and they’ve built organizations with keen situational awareness. When it comes to developing the ability to figure out where things are heading and respond nimbly to a changing environment, nothing is more important than analytics. Unfortunately, in recent years analytics (also known as data mining or business intelligence) has become the unloved stepchild of data sciences, overshadowed by machine learning and statistics. Those two disciplines layer mathematical sophistication on top of a foundation of human intuition, creating an appealing illusion of objectivity and deft steering. Ironically, of the three, analytics is the most essential competency for navigating crises. Solutions based on AI and machine learning hum along well during stable times but fall apart when disaster strikes. These technologies automate tasks by extracting patterns from data and turning them into instructions. Such models can quickly become obsolete when the inputs to the system change. Analytics, in contrast, alerts you when the rules of the game are changing. Without that kind of a warning, automation solutions can quickly go off the rails, leaving you exposed to exogenous shocks. Statistics has a similar shortcoming during a crisis. Statisticians help decision-makers get rigorous answers. But what if they’re asking the wrong questions? While statistical skills are required to test hypotheses, analysts have the acumen to come up with the right hypotheses in the first place. To attempt statistics without analytics, you’d need great confidence in your assumptions—the kind of confidence that’s foolhardy when a crisis pulls the rug out from under you. Analysts thrive in ambiguity. Their talent is exploration, which makes them particularly good at foreseeing and responding to crises. By searching internal and external data sources for critical information, analysts keep a finger on the pulse of what’s going on. They scan the horizon for trends and formulate questions about what’s behind them. Their job is to inspire executives with thought-provoking yet qualified possibilities. Once the highest-priority hypotheses have been short-listed by leaders, then it’s time to call in a statistician to pressure-test them and separate true insights from red herrings. During good times, leading organizations build analytics capabilities to strengthen their ability to innovate. Analysts’ ability to find clues to such things as shifting consumer tastes can help firms take advantage of opportunities before less-savvy competitors do. When the going gets tough, however, what looked like a nice-to-have innovation booster turns into a must-have safety net. To be sure, some events are impossible to see in advance—the true black swans—but addressing their fallout is a game best played with open eyes. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to cobble together a mature analytics department on short notice. The technical skills that allow analysts to guzzle data with lightning speed merely increase the mass of information they encounter. Spotting a gem in it takes something more. Without domain knowledge, business acumen, and strong intuition about the practical value of discoveries—as well as the communication skills to convey them to decision-makers effectively—analysts will struggle to be useful. It takes time for them to learn to judge what’s important in addition to what’s interesting. You can’t expect them to be an instant solution to charting a course through your latest crisis. Instead, see them as an investment in your future nimbleness. It also takes time to secure access to the promising data sources analysts need. Ideally, business leaders won’t wait for a big disruption to begin building relationships with data vendors, industry partners, and data collection specialists. Bear in mind that in the face of an extreme shock, your historical data sources may become obsolete. If your understanding of the past fails to give you a useful window on tomorrow’s world—perhaps because a pandemic has changed everything—it doesn’t matter how good your information was yesterday. You need new information. After the 2008 financial crash, for example, banks around the world recognized that there might be an advantage to analyzing nontraditional signals of creditworthiness, such as data from supermarket loyalty cards, but not all players were equally positioned to get access to them. James Day/Gallery Stock Additionally, your internal data stores may require special processing before analysts can mine them, so it’s worth thinking about hiring supporting data engineers. If analytics is the discipline of making data useful, then data engineering is the discipline of making data usable; it provides behind-the-scenes infrastructure that makes machine logs and colossal data stores compatible with analytics tool kits. When I began speaking at conferences about the importance of analytics, I found that convincing an audience of its value was the easy part. The mood changed when I explained the catch: Analytics is a time investment. You can’t count on getting something useful out of every foray into a data set. To succeed at exploration, your organization needs a culture of no-strings-attached analytics. As the leader, you are responsible for setting the scope (which data sources should be looked at) and the time frame (“You have two weeks to explore this database”). Then you must ensure that analysts aren’t punished for coming back empty-handed. During an extreme shock, your historical data sources may become obsolete. Then it doesn’t matter how good your information was yesterday. You need new information. Once business leaders accept that analytics represents an investment that may not immediately pay off, I hit the next stumbling block: the perception that only a large and technologically sophisticated company such as Alphabet can afford it. This is nonsense. In my experience you’re more likely to find analytics thriving in start-ups than at well-established behemoths. Start-ups naturally invest in analytics as they try to navigate a new market, with several generalists taking on a share of the exploratory work. Then as the venture grows, the culture changes. Workers are trusted less and made more accountable for return on their efforts, and overzealous management stifles opportunities for analytics to thrive. Analysts hired into this culture rarely get to enjoy the most interesting part of their work—exploration—and instead serve as human search engines and dashboard janitors. Many quit out of frustration as their potential is squandered. Creating a culture where analytics flourishes takes thoughtful leadership. As organizations grow toward incumbency, only the most visionary will have the courage to nurture a true analytics department and make sure that business leaders have access to it and are influenced by it. Industries that have been burned by a previous crisis — banking is a good example — are especially likely to invest in analytics and apply it to risk management. Becoming a leader in analytics takes a commitment to trust your analysts and give them space to do their work. Their job, after all, will be to reveal threats that you never even imagined should be on your radar. That sort of work can’t be managed with a stopwatch and a checklist. Crises such as a pandemic—when no one has the answers, and uncertainty is high—remind us of the importance of asking the right questions. Analytics gives firms an edge in learning and adapting. When the world is suddenly upended, those who can learn the fastest are best positioned to succeed. Smart companies will invest in analytics today to get ahead of whatever is coming tomorrow.  There are ordinary, predictable risks—and then there are black swan events, tsunami risks, and disasters. In this month’s Spotlight package, the experts share advice on how to deal with threats that are unexpected and overwhelming.

They key is that durable brands are adaptable brands — even legacy ones. To create durability, apply the MACE framework: 1) Mastery: Give your consumers non-transferrable rewards for using your products and engaging with your content; 2) Accessibility: Make your brand easily available to as many consumers as possible; 3) Cadence: Constantly create news and content around your brand; and 4) Ensnarement: Make your brand as sticky as possible by building in switching costs and creating network effects. What makes a brand last? Knowing the answer is what separates sustainable success from eventual obscurity. Almost every company devotes significant resources to defining their brand. But few ask the equally important question: how to protect it? Historically, brands have risen and fallen in prominence slowly. Look at almost any decade from the 1950s on, and the world’s most valuable consumer brands – from Oreo to AT&T – barely changed in ranking. Even as recently as the new millennium, this trend continued. Between 2000 and 2010 just two of Interbrand’s top 10 brands fell off the list. But only half of the brands on the list in 2010 remained as of 2019. The internet era makes brands less durable in part because consumer habits have digitized, creating new business models that have blindsided many traditional brands. But there is nothing inherently antagonistic to legacy brands about digital lifestyles. Coca-Cola remains one of the world’s most valuable brands – and it was invented in 1892! What, then, is it that makes a brand durable even as business models, technology, and consumer behavior radically change? They key is that durable brands are adaptable brands — even legacy ones, as we’ll see. So let me share what I have learned from working for the past five years as an entrepreneur and expert on esports. While esports brands certainly aren’t legacy brands, their rapid explosion holds lessons on the art of adaptability for any company. Esports has skyrocketed this decade to become a $27 billion dollar industry, more popular than the NBA. Pro gamers number among this generation’s highest earning celebrities. And the primary platform for watching esports, Twitch (acquired by Amazon for $1 billion in 2014), outperforms traditional broadcasters like ESPN. But arguably esports’ greatest success is the popular game Fortnite. In 2019, Fortnite grossed $1.9 billion dollars. NFL quarterbacks perform Fortnite victory dances in the end zone. And Star Wars announced the return of its arch-villain, the Emperor, by broadcasting his interstellar message inside the game. Fortnite wasn’t always a hit. In fact, the game launched in 2017 as a me-too zombie shooter that struggled in the face of an entrenched competitor: Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG). PUBG sold more than five million copies of its innovative “battle royale” format which allowed one hundred players to simultaneously engage in free-for-all gunplay. To recover, Fortnite rushed out its own version of a battle royale mode in just two months. But, crucially, Fortnite didn’t slavishly imitate PUBG. Its designers noticed that PUBG’s chaotic battles made hiding more effective than fighting, emphasizing patience over skill. So Fortnite allowed players to erect defensive structures anywhere on its map, favoring strategic thinking. As a result, Fortnite deeply rewarded mastery. Spending the time to learn the game’s unique building mechanics alongside traditional shooting skills resulted in consistent victories. Secondly, Fortnite made itself accessible, releasing as a free-to-play game, compared to PUBG’s $29.99 price. Furthermore, it employed a cartoony all-ages aesthetic, in contrast to PUBG’s gritty military look. And the game quickly made itself playable on any device: from high-end gaming PCs to mobile phones. Fortnite also recognized that not every gamer wants to shoot things in the head, and so launched concerts and creative play modes to appeal to the broadest swathe of consumers. Third, Fortnite committed to delivering a fast cadence of new content, releasing new character abilities and weapons almost every week. These changes kept the game constantly fresh and top-of-mind. Lastly, Fortnite ensnared its customers by introducing social features, matchmaking algorithms to pair players of equivalent skill, and a massive catalog of cosmetic items, such as NFL co-branded uniforms. These locked in its player base with network effects and switching costs. These four strategies catapulted Fortnite to meteoric success. By the end of 2018, Fortnite boasted 200 million registered users, while PUBG’s player population collapsed by 66%. These same tactics — what together I call the “MACE framework” — are not one-offs, but generalizable to all brands. Let’s look at them more closely. Mastery: Give your consumers non-transferrable rewards for using your products and engaging with your content. Ideally, these rewards require public displays of affinity or small (non-monetary) sacrifices to exploit the endowment effect (overvaluing losses) and familiarity effect (overvaluing affinity).  For example, Hasbro’s brand Magic, first released in 1993, grew 30% year-on-year in 2019 on the back of innovative products like Secret Lair, which are short-notice, 24-hours exclusives requiring a “digital queue” to purchase. Accessibility: Make your brand easily available to as many consumers as possible by following three simple rules. First, make your entry-level products as cheap as you can, and ideally free. For many industries, this means leveraging alternative pricing models (such as deferred payments, leases and subscriptions) to minimize upfront costs. Second, distribute your product or service through as many sales channels as possible. And third, design and market your products to appeal to younger and first-time customers. While older or existing buyers are likely higher margin, focusing primarily here limits the growth of your long-term customer base. For example, Marvel’s superhero films have significantly outperformed rival DC’s at the box office, in part because of a strategic decision to focus on PG-13 ratings and light-hearted humor that can appeal to all ages. Cadence: Constantly create news and content around your brand. First, frequently release new products (or product updates). Second, maximize promotional assets, such as marketing videos, by editing long-form media into micro-content. Third, encourage user generated content wherever possible. And fourth, communicate everything; even failure. Have a product launch that bombed? Start talking about it publicly. You’ll be surprised by the results, as Apple was during its feud with Taylor Swift. By directly admitting exploitative royalties, Apple transformed bad PR into viral social media praise, culminating in Swift herself advertising Apple’s products. Ensnarement: Make your brand as sticky as possible by building in switching costs and creating network effects. Two generalizable strategies for accomplishing this — systemization and spawning — involve product development: Systemized product lines are best embodied by LEGO. The brand eschews one-off releases (bricks) in favor of selling entire systems (LEGO model kits). Imagine how vulnerable LEGO would be to low cost brick competitors if all it sold was individual pieces! Spawning products include a built-in reason to share. Consider Coca-Cola’s Share-A-Coke promotion. By printing common names on Coke cans, the brand encouraged gifting amongst friends – helping grow sales from 1.7 billion to 1.9 billion servings a day. To illustrate the generalizability of the MACE model, let’s apply it to a more mundane world: thermostats. At first blush, you’d think home appliances have little to do with Fortnite’s multiplayer shootouts. But in fact their brand strategies are surprisingly similar. The success of the original smart thermostat, Nest, is a perfect example of how even staid, CPG products can be reinterpreted as MACE-ready brands for the digital age. Here’s how Nest strategy layered in MACE factors over its lifetime: Mastery: Nest thermostats reward mastery in a direct way: by saving customers money. The thermostats tracks energy savings, rewarding eco-friendly settings by displaying a Nest leaf. This leaf becomes more difficult to achieve over time, encouraging users to continuously interact with the device to further economize on heating and cooling costs. Accessibility: This was arguably Nest’s biggest point of differentiation at launch. The thermostat are designed for the digital generation: app-integrated, intuitive, and elegantly styled. Cadence: You might not think of a thermostat having a content cadence. Traditional thermostats are programmed once; then likely never again. But Nest updates its users, usually via its app. It automatically adjusts routines, such as lowering temperatures at bedtime. It displays time to reach desired temperature. It tracks activity patterns based on the weather. And much more. Smart thermostats don’t need to generate content, but Nest does. Ensnarement: Finally, Nest locks in its users with switching costs and network effects. As part of a broader Google smart home system of cameras, doorbells, alarms and locks, out-of-ecosystem purchases are painfully isolated. Even more cleverly, Nest leverages network effects by aggregating user behavioral data to create better algorithms for temperature adjustment. MACE is a blueprint for any brand — even traditional ones — to evolve for long-term relevancy. It is true that brands without inherent, digital connectivity require clever thinking to leverage this framework. But companies that cannot effectively engage with consumers on digital platforms are destined to be dinosaurs. Even the most traditional products, like thermostats can, and must, effectively do this. Manage with MACE in mind, and ensure your brand endures in our increasingly digitized world.

"91",91,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/marketers-underuse-ad-experiments-thats-a-big-mistake","marketing.txt","Business experimentation is—rightfully—framed as a gold standard by scholars and leading practitioners, but the practice has yet to find its way into most firms’ day-to-day advertising strategy. That’s a big mistake. E-commerce companies that conduct ad experiments see two to three percent better performance per experiment run (as measured by purchases achieved per advertising dollar spent).  In this study, an advertiser that ran 15 experiments (versus none) in a given year sees about a 30% higher ad performance that year; those that ran 15 experiments in the prior year see about a 45% increase in performance. Recently, I gave a talk to 30 senior digital growth managers on how to use business experimentation effectively. I started the session with a brief survey: Who had run experiments with their website and app — for example, testing different layouts, colors, designs, or onboarding experiences? Close to 90% of hands rose in response. Then I asked who had run experiments with their digital advertising, such as evaluating different audience targeting, frequency, or optimization regimes for their campaigns? Only about a third of those same hands went up. This result did not surprise me; rather, it confirmed what I had seen during a year-long investigation of firm behavior on Facebook’s advertising platform: While business experimentation is — rightfully — framed as a gold standard by scholars and leading practitioners, the practice has yet to find its way into most firms’ day-to-day advertising strategy. Many firms are used to non-experimental approaches to advertising measurement, such as marketing mix models, and hesitate to adopt experimentation-based measurement in part because they overestimate its complexity. Most digital advertising platforms offer “experimentation-as-a-service” tools and, while some of the testing parameters are indeed more advanced than what  has long been commonly available in advertising, a digital team can help sort through optimization strategies, frequency regimes, or audience targeting strategies. Many firms simply start off by testing their current digital approach against a control population called a “holdout group” which receives no messaging; this allows them to gauge how their existing ads work relative to no advertising. More sophisticated experimentation can then follow. To quantify companies’ use of experiments, my colleagues and I at Facebook Marketing Science Research conducted an observational survey of leading firms’ use of randomized control trials (RCTs) to gauge the impact of a given ad campaign on various business outcomes relative to a control. Though we suspected that only a minority of firms used the practice, we were surprised by just how few: Only 12.6% of the 6,777 companies we looked at had conducted a recent RCT (see our academic paper here). As you might expect, companies’ use of experimentation varies by industry. Factors such as the pace of consumer consideration and purchase cycles or (as will be discussed) the presence of organizational-culture barriers can influence adoption. At the top of the scale, somewhat more than 20% of e-commerce, telecommunications, and retail advertisers conducted experiments; however, only 6.7% of consumer package goods companies and 4.2% of automotive businesses did so. Firms that do experiment tend to run more than one experiment in a year, averaging 15 experiments per firm in e-commerce and close to 50 in the travel sector, and typically invest about 10% of their overall advertising budget in experimentally measured campaigns. This investment seems to pay off: E-commerce companies that conduct ad experiments see two to three percent better performance per experiment run (as measured by purchases achieved per advertising dollar spent).  In our sample, an advertiser that ran 15 experiments (versus none) in a given year sees about a 30% higher ad performance that year; those that ran 15 experiments in the prior year see about a 45% increase in performance, highlighting the positive longer-term impact of this strategy. Given the powerful impact of ad experiments, why are they so underused? Through conversations with internal and external domain experts and scholars, I’ve identified several common organizational obstacles that may account for this. Organizational inertia: The “Mad Men” days of advertising are (largely) over, but creativity continues to be an essential ingredient for lasting success in advertising. You may remember Donald Draper’s tantrums when he faced research that challenged his preconceptions. Because marketing creatives can be skeptical about data-analytic approaches, empiricism and data-driven decision making need to be carefully introduced to — and ultimately combined with — creative and intuitive advertising operations. This process takes time. Holdout aversion: Randomized controlled trials require a control group; as noted, in ad experimentation the control is often a holdout group that is not exposed to any advertising. This of course lowers the number of potential customers that the campaign will reach. This does not sit well with many marketers who may feel that the cost associated with excluding potential customer from a campaign outweighs the benefits of experimentation. But as noted, our study shows that advertisers who run experiments experience better performance than those who do not. While we cannot be certain that experimentation caused this outperformance, it is highly unlikely that using holdouts as a control is a net negative. Requirement of inter-company alignment: Managers are used to regularly changing, adapting, and evaluating the firm’s websites and apps, tapping inside talent. Experimentation with advertising, on the other hand, commonly requires collaboration between companies and the use of tools provided by other firms. Additionally, many firms may lack the required culture of collaboration between marketing and other functions needed to execute ad experimentation. Entrenched legacy decision support tools: Marketing mix models are well established and trusted decision-support tools that are seen as less technologically complex and costly than setting up RCTs. But in fact, launching RCTs on digital channels doesn’t require unusually complicated technology, can be done at near zero cost, and can actually help optimize existing marketing mix models. My colleagues and I at Facebook worked with the Boston Consulting Group to understand how leading firms successfully integrate experimentation into advertising operations. While there is no “one size fits all” solution, we identified the following four organizational characteristics among high-performing firms. Executive endorsement: Successful experimentation initiatives need an executive sponsor who can align stakeholders and create the urgency required to change existing behavior and convictions. Advertising experiments can reveal new approaches that may require major marketing budget reallocations across channels. If, for example, an experiment identifies a strategy that would increase ROI five-fold but would require shifting millions of dollars in the budget against some executives’ will,  an “intervention from the entire C-suite, with the CEO as the ultimate advocate,” may be needed “to break down broader business silos,” according to BCG’s recent  report “Marketing Measurement Done Right.” Culture: Leadership needs to foster a culture where robust empirical evidence can overrule preconceptions and opinions. This culture needs to be set (and lived!) at the top. Installing cross-functional committees and “forced mingling” in cross-departmental workshops can catalyze the required culture shift. The BCG report describes the case of a large automaker: “Management initiated a program of cross-functional conversations involving business units and functional departments. These sessions used multiunit data first to define profitability and then to determine how it would be measured across the company and what success would look like for the manufacturer as a whole.” While such initiatives benefit the firm more widely, they help establish a crucial basis for companies to be able to leverage the insights generated in large-scale advertising experiments. Talent: The talent required to produce and understand complex data and experimental results needs to be acquired and trusted by senior stakeholders. A marketing data science team reporting to an executive function can take on this role. In the words of a digital leader in the telecommunications space quoted in the BCG report: “Our priority became hiring the best talent for our digital team…With the right people in place, we achieved 40% year-over-year sales growth with the same marketing spend.” Persistence: Experimentation is a continuous iterative process that is never completed and that shapes other internal processes. To reap its full benefits, firms need to view it not as a tactical task but a strategic pillar of decision making and ideation. Rallying the troops behind it may take a long time. As the vice president of marketing for an automotive OEM that BCG surveyed reports: “It takes a year of everyone questioning a new model until we have enough history to believe in it.” A heuristic approach to get advertising experimentation off the ground can be to hire a dedicated digital marketing team and earmark a portion of the advertising budget for experimentation; as noted, 10% is typical among companies with a successful experimentation program. Then, in collaboration with other company functions such as finance, marketing leadership can identify a key performance indicator that advertising is to drive. Examples are return on marketing investment or a composite of brand and direct response metrics. The marketing team can then develop new advertising approaches to influence the defined metric. The right culture can catalyze the team to rigorously adopt better-performing advertising approaches and abandon poorly performing ones — ultimately ensuring that existing and potential customers see better and more relevant ads."
"92",92,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/when-do-we-trust-ais-recommendations-more-than-peoples","marketing.txt","Companies are increasingly turning to AI to make recommendations to consumers. But sometimes consumers don’t trust AI’s advice and want a human’s suggestions. To understand when consumers trust one vs. the other, the authors conducted a series of experiments. Their finding: Consumers tend to believe AI is more competent at making recommendations when they are seeking functional or practical offerings and humans when they are more interested in an offering’s experiential or sensory features. These views are based on mistaken beliefs. However, there are ways that marketers can overcome this bias. More and more companies are leveraging technological advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and other forms of artificial intelligence to provide relevant and instant recommendations to consumers. From Amazon to Netflix to REX Real Estate, firms are using AI recommenders to enhance the customer experience. AI recommenders are also increasingly used in the public sector to guide people to essential services. For example, the New York City Department of Social Services uses AI to give citizens recommendations on disability benefits, food assistance, and health insurance. However, simply offering AI assistance won’t necessarily lead to more successful transactions. In fact, there are cases when AI’s suggestions and recommendations are helpful and cases when they might be detrimental. When do consumers trust the word of a machine, and when do they resist it? Our research suggests that the key factor is whether consumers are focused on the functional and practical aspects of a product (its utilitarian value) or focused on the experiential and sensory aspects of a product (its hedonic value). In an article in the Journal of Marketing — based on data from over 3,000 people who took part in 10 experiments — we provide evidence supporting for what we call a word-of-machine effect: the circumstances in which people prefer AI recommenders to human ones. The word-of-machine effect stems from a widespread belief that AI systems are more competent than humans in dispensing advice when utilitarian qualities are desired and are less competent when the hedonic qualities are desired. Importantly, the word-of-machine effect is based on a lay belief that does not necessarily correspond to the reality. The fact of the matter is humans are not necessarily less competent than AI at assessing and evaluating utilitarian attributes. Vice versa, AI is not necessarily less competent than humans at assessing and evaluating hedonic attributes. Indeed, AI selects flower arrangements for 1-800-Flowers and creates new flavors for food companies such as McCormick. Nevertheless, our experiments suggest that if someone is focused on utilitarian and functional qualities, then, from a marketer’s perspective, the word of a machine is more effective than the word of human recommenders. For someone focused on experiential and sensory qualities, human recommenders are more effective. For instance, in one of our experiments we assessed the word-of-machine effect on people’s propensity to choose products and people’s consumption experiences. To do so, we asked over 200 passersby in (pre-Covid-19) Boston to participate in a blind market test for haircare products. Using leaflets to explain the test, we asked each person to select one of two hair product samples, one recommended by AI and the other by a human. As predicted, when passersby were asked to focus only on utilitarian and functional attributes such as practicality, objective performance, and chemical composition, more people chose the AI-recommended sample (67%) than the one recommended by a person. When passersby were asked to focus only on experiential and sensory attributes such as indulgence, scent, and a spa-like vibe, more people choose the human-recommended sample (58%) than the one recommended by AI. The word-of-machine effect also emerged in a second field experiment that we conducted in the Italian resort town of Cortina. We first primed people to consider a real estate investment relying only on either its functional and practical qualities or its emotional and sensory-based qualities. Then, we asked people to choose one of two selections of house properties: one curated by a human real estate agent and one by an AI algorithm. When presented with a pitch that focused on practicality, more people (60%) chose a list of AI-curated properties. But more participants (76%) chose the human-curated property list in response to a pitch that appealed to the senses such as enjoyment. The word-of-machine effect even extended to product consumption and taste perception. We recruited 144 participants from the University of Virginia campus and informed them that we were testing chocolate-cake recipes for a local bakery. The participants were given two options: one cake created with ingredients selected by an AI chocolatier and one created with ingredients selected by a human chocolatier. Participants were then asked to eat one of the two cakes, which were identical in appearance and ingredients, and rate the cake for two experiential/sensory features (indulgent taste and aromas, pleasantness to the senses) and two utilitarian/functional attributes (beneficial chemical properties and healthiness). Participants rated the AI-recommended cake as less tasty but healthier than the cake recommended by the human chocolatier. In cases where utilitarian features are most important, the word-of-machine effect is more pronounced. Using an online survey, we asked 303 respondents to imagine buying a winter coat and review a list of practical/functional (e.g., breathability) and experiential/sensory (e.g., fabric type) qualities of the coat, rating how much they cared about these features. The more participants cared about utilitarian features, the more they preferred an AI shopping assistant over a human, and the more they cared about hedonic features, the more they preferred a human shopping assistant over an AI. Even though it is clear that consumer confidence in AI assistance is higher when searching for products that are utilitarian (e.g., computers and dishwashers), this does not mean that companies offering products that promise more hedonic experiences (e.g., fragrances, food, and wine) are out of luck when it comes to using AI recommenders. In fact, we found that people embrace AI’s recommendations as long as AI works in partnership with humans. For instance, in one experiment, we framed AI as augmented intelligence that enhances and supports human recommenders rather than replacing them. The AI-human hybrid recommender fared as well as the human-only recommender even when experiential and sensory considerations were important. These findings are important because they represent the first empirical test of augmented intelligence that focuses on AI’s assistive role in advancing human capabilities, rather than as an alternative to humans, which is how it is typically perceived. One company that is seeing success with this approach is Stitch Fix, which uses AI in partnership with human stylists to choose clothing for its customers. How might managers correct the incorrect lay belief about the competence of AI vs. humans to provide advice? Our research uncovered several interventions that could attenuate it. In one experiment, we asked participants to consider the opposite of what they initially believed to be true with regards to AI competence. We did so by prompting them to consider the ways in which they could be wrong about what they expected a human or an AI recommender to be good at. We found that prompting people to consider a different viewpoint about the recommender’s ability reduced the effect we found in the previous experiments. In other words, the AI recommenders scored higher on a hedonic scale, suggesting that people were more open to AI recommenders even when focused on experiential/sensory qualities, and the human recommenders scored higher on a utilitarian scale, suggesting that people were more open to human recommenders even when seeking functional/practical qualities. In the real world, trying to convince a consumer to think the opposite of their core belief is difficult, so we tested a more practical and easier intervention to determine the effect of removing bias. We invited 299 online respondents to read about an app called “Cucina” that would rely on AI to give recipe recommendations. Within the app, the participants were able to interact with a chat bot — an AI chef — that was programmed to assist them. The chat bot greeted each participant and introduced itself (“Hi, Mark! I am here to suggest a recipe for you to try!”). The AI chef then delivered the consider-the-opposite protocol using a fun, interactive nudge: “Some people might think that an artificial intelligence chef is not competent to give food suggestions, but this is a misjudgment. For a moment, set aside your expectations about me. When it comes to making food suggestions, could you consider the idea that I could be good at things you do not expect me to be good at?” That resulted in more favorable perceptions of the AI recommendation even when people were considering the experiential and sensory qualities of a recipe like taste and aromas. Our findings are insightful for managers navigating the remarkable technology-enabled opportunities that are growing in today’s marketplace. Although there is a clear correlation between utilitarian/functional and experiential/sensory attributes and consumer trust (or distrust) in AI recommenders, there are ways in which organizations can design the customer experience to take advantage of the word-of-machine effect. For instance, companies like Netflix and YouTube could emphasize AI-based recommendations when utilitarian attributes are relatively more important to people (e.g., when they are selecting a documentary to view) and human-based recommendations (“similar users”) when hedonic attributes are relatively more important (e.g., when selecting a horror movie to view). Similarly, a company in the hospitality industry such as TripAdvisor could emphasize AI-based recommendations for business travel services and de-emphasize AI-based recommendations for leisure travel services. As firms navigate the challenges of attracting and retaining customers in a crowded digital marketplace, those with a good understanding of the conditions under which consumers do and do not trust the “word” of AI recommenders will have a competitive advantage.

"93",93,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/the-surprising-upside-of-expensive-products-that-dont-sell","marketing.txt","Many businesses are managing a sharp decline in sales during the ongoing coronavirus crisis. An instinctive reaction may be to cut low-performing products from their menu of offerings — but this isn’t always the best way forward. The authors lay out a case for adding an ultra-expensive product to their portfolio. There are five reasons to do it: To increase sales across other products; to communicate expertise; to convey prestige; to garner publicity; and to move upmarket. When dealing with recessions or drastic declines in sales, companies are often tempted to increase profits by cancelling low-performing products from their portfolios. But sales numbers aren’t everything, and this isn’t always the best way forward. We have identified a counter-intuitive — yet potentially highly-beneficial — alternative: Leveraging high-priced products that don’t sell much as a competitive advantage. There are five key reasons why businesses should consider this strategy. Reason 1: To increase the sales of other products in the lineup. Offering a premium option, even if it is out-of-reach for most customers, could help to make the other items offered by the brand appear like a great deal. This shift in perceived value is especially likely to occur if those cheaper alternatives offer relatively little downgrade in terms of quality. For instance, Samsung’s flagship phone, the Galaxy S20 Ultra, retails for an eye-popping $1,600 in its 512GB version. While Samsung knows that this feature-rich version appeals only to a handful of enthusiasts with deep pockets, it nevertheless serves to reinforce the sales of its more popular little brother, the Galaxy S20 phone, which comes off as a bargain in comparison: A very similar user experience for only $1,000. Reason 2: To communicate expertise. Offering more-expensive-than-usual options can also serve to communicate expertise or innovation. For instance, generic drug companies (e.g., manufacturers of Digoxin or Doxycycline) tend to carry some ambitiously-priced products in their portfolios. They offer these high-priced drugs to signal their ability to research and develop innovative and advanced treatments. This strategy effectively communicates that the brand can punch above its weight, even if these drugs do not sell much. Likewise, the Swiss watchmaker Vacheron Constantin released what it deemed “the most complicated watch in the world,” the one-off reference 57260 with 57 horological complications. This release allowed the brand to showcase its watchmaking skills, even if the majority of its product line is much more modest from a technical standpoint. Another example is the warehouse retailer Costco, which offers a few big-ticket jewelry items, such as a $600,000 diamond. Carrying these unique products gives Costco legitimacy as a diamond retailer for its more typical offerings, such as engagement rings, earrings, and pendants, which cost a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Reason 3: To convey brand prestige. Carrying high-priced items could also be used to generate or maintain premium brand associations in consumers’ minds, which might otherwise be affected by the presence of other affordable products in the portfolio. As a case in point, Apple launched the unapologetically expensive $699 Mac Pro Wheels Kit, a set of four custom-designed stainless steel and rubber wheels that make it easy to move its computer around. The company released this unique accessory near the time it introduced one of its most affordable phones ever, the mainstream $399 iPhone SE2 model. This release helped cement the brand positioning among the premium tech segment, which was at risk of shifting toward a more accessible positioning as Apple continues to release budget-conscious product lines. Similarly, the top-selling American whiskey brand, Jack Daniel’s, carries several low-volume premium labels, such as the $500 Sinatra Century, under the same Jack Daniel’s brand umbrella. The brand continues to offer these more marginal product lines despite making the vast majority of its sales from the well-recognized Black Label and other affordable variations. Again, this strategy helps elevate the brand associations beyond the status traditionally associated with its top-selling products. Reason 4: To get free publicity. While brands can never accurately predict what news will become viral, one proven formula to generate some attention is to bring to market outrageously expensive products. This way, brands may benefit from the free publicity that comes with media coverage and social media buzz, even if the spotlighted product does not sell. For instance, the release of a $1.3 million gold and diamond-encrusted vodka bottle by the Russian car brand Russo-Baltique allowed the brand to gain overnight recognition around the world. Similarly, the release of $30 branded clay bricks by the streetwear fashion brand Supreme was able to generate a considerable amount of free publicity for the brand among the general population — from fashion experts, media, and customers, all trying to figure out why the product existed in the first place. Reason 5: To gradually move the brand upmarket. Today’s consumers are eager to trade down on price, but getting them to trade up is challenging and complicated. Brands can open the door to a potential repositioning by carrying some high-priced items that will move the range of acceptable price points for the rest of the portfolio. This way, moving the brand up the price ladder in the future may seem more justified and appropriate. For example, Nike regularly releases some limited series of sneakers, such as the Back to the Future II-inspired AIR MAG, whose current aftermarket price is around $26,000. Inspired by these limited editions calling for huge premiums, consumers are increasingly willing to splurge more money on Nike’s regular athletic shoes and sneakers lines. The brand is taking notes, consistently raising its prices in recent years, occupying a more premium position in the marketplace. If your company is experiencing a dip in revenue, it might be time to get creative with your sales strategy; rolling out a high-priced product could be the answer you’re looking for."

However, most of them are product- and service-centric first, focusing on how to enhance their offerings rather than putting themselves in their customers’ shoes. To come up with truly innovative customer-centric ideas, companies must 1) Understand the problem the customer is trying to solve; 2) Identify and eliminate pain points; and 3) Look beyond their products. How would you reimagine a gas station for the future? Even with the increasing penetration of electric vehicles, gasoline cars are likely to remain the dominant automobile for years or even decades. I have asked this question of hundreds of senior executives. They typically suggest things like including a coffee shop, making the station a drop-off point for Amazon boxes, or having robots pump gas. Their rationale for such changes is to provide additional value to customers. But are these ideas really customer-centric? Are they addressing the job the customer is trying to do – conveniently refuel the car. No. Most people consider going to the gas station an unavoidable inconvenience. If people need to refill their car but hate getting gas how can we solve this problem? Not by putting Starbucks in gas stations. How about, then, bringing the gas to them? This may seem far-fetched but in fact several on-demand gas services launched in recent years including Filld and Booster do exactly this. Customers use an app to order gas when they need it, and these companies deliver. It’s not much of stretch from there to imagine that cars might soon automatically order their own gas when they sense they’re getting low. Every company believes it is customer-centric. However, most of them are product- and service-centric first, focusing on how to enhance their offerings (e.g., adding services to gas stations) rather than putting themselves in their customers’ shoes (and realizing that people want to avoid the gas station altogether). In this article, I describe three ways companies can come up with truly innovative ideas by thinking about customers first. Often customers have difficulty articulating the problem they are trying to solve. Therefore, it is critical to dig deeper to understand the root cause of customers’ challenges. This sort of investigating led Deepak Garg to build what’s now a billion-dollar venture, Rivigo, which is revolutionizing the trucking industry in India. Trained at McKinsey and looking to build a company, Deepak realized that the rise of e-commerce had dramatically increased the demand for trucks, yet in India the industry was struggling with the shortage of drivers. How could this be in a country of over a billion people with high unemployment rate — despite healthy wages for truck drivers? To solve this puzzle, Deepak visited the small villages where many truck drivers were recruited. Instead of pursuing a typical consulting approach to research with its large samples and quantitative analysis, Deepak undertook an ethnographic exploration to understand the social roots of the problem. During his one-on-one conversations he discovered that since truck drivers are almost always on the road, they often develop bad habits such as excessive drinking, drug use, and visiting prostitutes. Partly because of this, they are considered the 37th caste in India — lower than the untouchables. No villager wanted a son to become a truck driver or a daughter to marry one. (Yes, almost all truck drivers in India are men.) Deepak’s discussions made it clear that the root cause of the trucker shortage is that truck drivers are on the road for long stretches, away from home, and that encourages bad habits. What, then, is the solution? Could it be to bring the drivers back to their homes every night? That could work – but how could he make it happen if a trucker’s trip from Delhi to Mumbai took three or four days? A relay-service, he realized, could solve the problem. Effectively, he built truck stops four hours apart along a selected route. A driver could go from point A to point B, drop his truck there and pick up another truck to drive from B back to A. Another driver in turn would pick up the truck from B and take to point C, and so on. This not only brought drivers home each night, it created immense value for logistics companies. A truck that was previously utilized for only 10 to 12 hours a day, allowing drivers time to sleep and eat, could now operate more than 20 hours, cutting total delivery times by almost half. To be sure, there’s a lot of technology behind the scene that ensures that trucks and drivers are available at the appropriate times at the right truck stops. But the fundamental idea of Rivigo started by understanding the root cause of the problem. Traditional retailers are under enormous pressure from Amazon and other e-commerce players. Many believe that part of their disadvantage is that they can’t track their customers in store, and so they’re investing in technologies that will help them do this. Yet most don’t have a clear idea of exactly how they are going to use the massive amounts of data they will capture to compete against the likes of Amazon. Instead of throwing sophisticated technology at a general challenge (tracking customers) these companies might be better served by identifying and solving specific customer problems. Many of these are staring them in the face. How many times have you gone to a department store and left empty handed because you were unable to find things that you were looking for? Why not simply put a (carefully cleaned) iPad at select locations in the store to help customers navigate?  And how often have you had to wait in slow-moving lines just to pay for your purchase? It is ironic that retailers make you wait to take your money! Enabling self-payment could easily reduce this source of friction. Amazon is using computer vision in its cashierless Go Stores to solve precisely this problem. Hointer (now part of Wesfarmers), founded by a former Amazon executive, tested a new store concept to address both these consumer problems. The store sold high-end men’s pants that hung on bars for easy perusal. Instead of displaying all sizes, only one of each kind was on display. Consumers downloaded Hointer’s app, scanned the barcode of the desired item and selected their size. A robot then delivered the item via a chute in the nearby fitting room, where the consumer could try it on, drop it in another chute if he did not like it, or pay for it in the fitting room, which was equipped with a credit card scanner. Mapping customer journeys has become a norm in the industry. However, almost every company starts and ends its consideration of the journey with its product — say a car or a mortgage. This can miss what’s driving customers in the first place, which can be highly useful in understanding consumer motivation and potential opportunities to add value. Imagine a bank designing a mobile app for mortgage. It might identify steps in the application process to make it easier for consumers to search and apply for a mortgage, build algorithms to quickly respond to their applications, and enable live chat with an agent to help answer questions. This is a typical product-focused process. But it overlooks why the customer is seeking a mortgage. Piyush Gupta, the CEO of Singapore-based DBS bank, encouraged his team to think beyond the bank’s products. The team realized that no one gets up in the morning excited about buying a mortgage. The true excitement is in buying their house. This part of the journey begins long before consumers think about applying for a mortgage. So, the team investigated what might help consumers in finding their dream house in the first place. The result was DBS’s Home Connect mobile app which integrates publicly available information to aid them in their search. Consumers download the app and when they visit a neighborhood to see houses, they can simply hold up their phone to scan the surroundings and view the latest transaction prices nearby. If their decision depends on schools or distance to public transportation or shopping, the app can provide that information. When consumers find their dream house, a mortgage calculator helps them determine if they can afford it. This process has enabled DBS to generate leads and gain market share. Executives from every company want to engage consumers, but have they paused to think why a consumer should engage with a bar of soap or a can of soda? Every company in the world claims to be customer-centric, but are they really thinking from customers’ point of view?  To become truly customer-centric, company executives need to look beyond their products and services to the problem the customer is trying to solve."
"95",95,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/industrial-firms-need-to-give-their-customers-a-digital-experience","marketing.txt","We tend to think that industrial customers are old-fashioned in their tastes. But in fact the authors have research showing that they are hungry for digital innovation in their interactions with industrial suppliers. In May 2020 L.E.K.’s Annual Contractor Survey found that most industrials customers are already using digital tools for purchases and other activities. For example, the survey found that building and construction customers used digital channels 80% to 90% of the time to gather product information, read reviews, compare prices, and check product quality and availability. Across all industries, upwards of 40% of planned purchases are now made on websites or mobile apps. Indeed, many industrials leaders are calling for increased investment in digital customer experiences to maintain the health of the sales funnel, drive conversion, and maintain relationships — and there is ample evidence that such investments pay off. Leading industrial companies will think through their customer journey and how digital tools can enhance each step along the way. When it comes to embracing digital solutions to engage customers, many industrial businesses have lagged behind consumer-facing enterprises. There are a variety of reasons for this gap, but what we often hear is that industrial customers simply aren’t ready for digital engagement. However, based on a large body of L.E.K. research, we beg to differ: customers are far more prepared for digital engagement than industrial leaders may realize. What’s more, Covid-19 is pushing once digitally-resistant customers to new levels of comfort with technology and raising expectations for how their business partners engage them. In May 2020 L.E.K.’s Annual Contractor Survey found that most industrials customers are already using digital tools for purchases and other activities. For example, the survey found that building and construction customers used digital channels 80% to 90% of the time to gather product information, read reviews, compare prices, and check product quality and availability. Across all industries, upwards of 40% of planned purchases are now made on websites or mobile apps. Further proliferation of digital tools, demographic trends, and the current pandemic will only drive these numbers higher. Indeed, many industrials leaders are calling for increased investment in digital customer experiences to maintain the health of the sales funnel, drive conversion, and maintain relationships — and there is ample evidence that such investments pay off. A recent L.E.K. global study revealed that 83% of the industrial firms that have been most successful at increasing revenue, market share or net promoter score (NPS), say they have made meaningful investments in digital customer engagement versus only 19% of less successful firms. While many industrial firms are still playing digital catch-up, there are leaders out there who acknowledge customers’ digital readiness and are implementing a broad range of tools, technologies and updated processes to enhance the customer experience ― from demand generation to enabling purchases, to post-sale service and support. By setting the standard that customers are looking for, these leaders are securing a first-mover advantage. As customers increasingly demand digital experiences, industrial firms that hang back are likely to face an uphill battle as they try to retain mindshare and high customer satisfaction. It is important to note, however, that successful firms do not simply set up an e-commerce capability or throw money at the latest hot technology and hope something sticks. Rather, they analyze the customer journey and carefully select digital tools that are best suited to engage customers based on their individual needs and behaviors. Furthermore, meticulous segmentation of customer needs is an important input to evaluating the costs and benefits of employing emerging technologies. The typical customer journey begins pre-purchase, when a potential customers identifies a need, researches potential solutions and ultimately selects a product. Companies are applying a variety of digital tools to cut through the clutter and win customers at this critical stage. For example, Linde, a global industrial gases and engineering solutions company, developed an augmented reality (AR) application to engage customers and facilitate the sales conversion process. Their tool uses AR to give customers a “live” experience with the company’s cryogenic freezers by projecting an image of the freezer into the customer’s factory setup. While clarity on dimensions within the actual production space had previously driven a lengthy sales process, Linde’s use of AR has helped customers get over the conversion hump and improved the overall purchase experience. Likewise, building-products company Azek developed a 3D visualization tool to help customers see what their products will look like when projects are completed. The company then uses the data captured during this process to inform its customer relationship management (CRM) system, giving it a better understanding of channel and influencer touchpoints, driving stickier relationships, and offering valuable insights into emerging design trends. Once the customer has made a decision to purchase, they want to be able to carry out the transaction as effortlessly as possible, especially in situations where ongoing purchases are likely. Digital portals not only facilitate purchases but help companies meet their customers’ needs efficiently. Brenntag, a global chemical distribution company, turned to DigiB — an independent subsidiary tasked with rapidly advancing the company’s internal digital initiatives — to create its customer portal, Brenntag Connect. The self-service portal offers several standard features, including online ordering, order tracking, automation of repeat orders, and online quotes. But the portal’s machine-learning capabilities also allow it to optimize and customize purchases and make product recommendations, so that it becomes increasingly tailored to individual customer needs. Finally, post-purchase service and support are essential to ensuring customer loyalty. This is an area where industrial firms have an opportunity to shine, as many have begun to embrace Industry 4.0 and the underlying technologies that can provide customers with better ways to visualize their operations, monitor and diagnose issues remotely, and predict maintenance needs — all capabilities that have become more important during the pandemic. There are numerous examples of industrial firms that are leveraging IoT-enabled monitoring and predictive maintenance to enhance the customer experience post-purchase. One example is Atlas Copco, a Swedish industrial company, which improved equipment maintenance of its air compressors via a mobile app that allows customers to perform remote monitoring. This technology has reduced downtime, increased systems data gathering and improved customer retention. For industrial firms who have been slow to adopt a digital mindset, the time is now to make thoughtful investments; the divide between companies that are digitally advantaged and those that are not appears to be widening. A recent L.E.K. study of industrials firms found that while nearly 40% planned to increase their investments in digital customer experience as a result of Covid-19, firms who already claimed advantage in the area were twice as likely as their less-experienced peers to accelerate digitally. While most talk of customer experience innovation has focused on consumer-facing businesses, industrial firms are by no means immune to digital disruption in this area. Unless they can accommodate customer demands for digital tools and capabilities, using them to enhance every phase of the customer journey, they may well find themselves struggling to compete with faster-moving peers or new entrants for whom digital is a way of life.

"96",96,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/name-your-brand-with-a-global-audience-in-mind","marketing.txt","As you look to expand your business into international markets, what can you do to ensure you select a brand name that resonates with your global customers? Here are five strategies to help marketers develop a global-ready brand name. First, consider the brand’s expected shelf life to determine how big an investment you want to make in the name. Next, gather input from international customers to shed light on any language- or culture-specific connotations. Third, conduct online research to determine the SEO landscape for your top names. Fourth, ensure your legal bases are covered. Finally, circle back to your customers — an iterative approach is the only way to ensure that the name you settle on is your best possible option. Coming up with the perfect name for a brand takes a lot of work. Whether you’re launching a new product or rebranding an existing one, marketers often spend months analyzing data, conducting interviews, and carrying out research to find the best name to set themselves apart from competitors. But no matter how thorough you may be, if your research is biased toward your home market, you’re likely to run into challenges when you expand internationally. What can marketers do to set a brand up for global success from the start? The longer you expect the brand name to stay in global circulation, the more careful you’ll need to be with selecting a name that takes international considerations into account. Are international customers contributing a significant percentage of revenue today? Do you expect that percentage to increase in the future? If so, you’ll definitely want to consider other markets in your decision-making process. If selling abroad is not a top priority, then there is less urgency today. But even if it’s not an immediate concern, thinking about these questions now can help you avoid extra rebranding work later. Otherwise, you run the risk of learning too late that the name you picked isn’t appropriate for your future markets if and when you do choose to expand internationally. You’ll want to start by coming up with a list of candidate names for your brand or product. It’s fine to do this exercise with your home market and language in mind, but if you can, try to involve people with international experience from the very beginning. Their input upfront can help steer you toward more globally viable options. Once you have a few candidates, it’s time to do some qualitative research: Interviews with customers from your prospective international markets can shed light on how the different options sound in different cultural and linguistic contexts. If you’re not sure which markets to include, start with the countries where you have the most customers today. If you don’t yet have any customers outside your home country, you can research the top global markets for your industry. And if that fails, try looking at the top countries in which your competitors or industry-adjacent companies operate. In addition, if you don’t have existing international customers to interview, the next best thing is to ask prospective customers — people who fit the general description of a potential customer. And if that’s not possible, consider reaching out to business partners who operate in your target markets for their insights and/or connections. Here are some research questions you can ask: Is the name easy to pronounce in other languages? The easier it is to say, the better. Keep in mind that the pronunciation in other languages often adds new meaning, so you’ll need input from experts in the local market. For example, the brand name for Tide detergent in Chinese is Taizi, which both sounds similar to “Tide” and literally means “gets rid of dirt.” Reebok is known in Chinese as Rui bu, which means “quick steps.” Marketers often worry about consistency across languages, but brand names don’t necessarily need to sound identical in every tongue. Heineken in Chinese is Xi li, which sounds nothing like the English name, but translates to “happy power.” What connotations does the name have in your target cultures? By simply surveying or interviewing people in your company’s top countries, you can find out quickly if your name candidate has any awkward or embarrassing connotations. You can also find out if certain brand names have positive connotations you might not have been aware of, or if they sound similar to any other widely known brands. In addition, even in markets that share your company’s native language, it’s important to think about cultural segments within your target audience. Both Nike and Ben and Jerry’s launched products with “black and tan” in the name, not realizing that this term was highly offensive to customers in Ireland. Both ended up pulling the products from shelves as a result. What other names would you suggest? This is my favorite part of the process. Often, if you just explain your product’s purpose and share a few key ideas that you want associated with it, your target customers will provide you with some great alternatives for what they might call it. These options might even work well not just for your international customers, but for your domestic market as well, since the authentic voice of the customer might resonate better with your target market than something concocted by your marketing team in a vacuum. Once you have a good understanding of your top name candidates, it’s time to consider the SEO implications in each of your target countries and languages. Try to find a brand name that is unique enough that your company can quickly become a top search result for that term. For example, SEO expert and tech founder Rand Fishkin chose SparkToro as his company’s name because he knew it would provide an SEO advantage in his target market. Be sure to conduct this search viability exercise in each of your top potential markets, since SEO can vary dramatically in different areas. As part of this research, you’ll want to identify the branded web assets you’ll need to support the brand. Are the domain names, social media accounts, and other online channels you’d like to obtain actually available? Think through your current marketing strategies and your future plans. If SEO is a major component of your strategy, don’t pick a brand name that will lead people in your top markets to land on other websites or social channels when they search for it. Now that you have gathered customer input and conducted online research, hopefully a couple of potential names have risen to the top. Once you’re confident in the global viability and online marketing potential of these names, ask your legal team for advice on the trademark and intellectual property front. Often, legal teams don’t want to be involved until you’ve settled on your final name, because international trademark research can consume significant time and resources — but it’s vital to ensure your legal bases are covered. Ask your team if they’d prefer to have the full list of candidates earlier, only get involved when you’ve compiled a short list, or wait until you’ve made your final selection. Ultimately, coming up with a name that’s suited for international scale is an iterative process. You’ll think you’ve landed on a great name, until you find out it has unpleasant connotations in one of your top markets. Then, you’ll find another winner, but you’ll realize you can’t obtain certain key web properties or social media handles that you’ll need. You might find you have to start back at square one and come up with an entirely new list of candidates. But rest assured that this is time well spent. Even though it might be tempting to just choose a name quickly that will work in your home market and language, remember that small decisions today can dramatically impact your international growth later on. Designing anything for global scale — a process, a product, or a brand name —  always takes a bit more upfront thought. But if you invest this time now, it will future-proof your marketing content, domains, publicity, and many other investments that you’ll make in your brand along the way.

"97",97,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/marketing-in-the-age-of-resistance","marketing.txt","Authenticity in marketing has always been a best practice, but it becomes even more crucial in this time of social unrest and Covid-19. This is not a time for companies to share generic, hollow, or hypocritical sentiments. It is a time for them to be humble, own up to mistakes, and express a desire to grow. This level of humility and authenticity is what consumers want to see. When attempting to comment on sensitive topics, more companies need to bring in perspectives from outside experts to maintain the thoughtfulness and sincerity of their messaging. When customers or employees voice concerns about Covid-19, racial injustice, or other events, companies need to work to process their feedback critically. Finally, companies should not underestimate the power of a sincere apology — even if the transgression occurred decades ago. Apologies are only the first steps of an ongoing dialogue designed to bring about thoughtful and meaningful progress. Modern consumers are as politically and socially conscious as ever. While some brands respond out of fear of alienating sects of their audience, a recent Morning Consult study found that merely saying the “right things” or “standing in solidarity” no longer cut it with consumers. They want the brands they support to back up those platitudes with action. At the moment — with protests against racial injustice continuing across the globe — companies face increased pressure to denounce discrimination publicly and solidify their commitments to diversity and inclusion. We have recently seen companies respond to this demand in a variety of ways. After George Floyd’s death, some brands posted brief messages of support and solidarity on social media, while others launched full-scale multichannel marketing campaigns. Regardless of the approach, companies should proceed with care when commenting on current events — especially when they involve social justice or politically polarizing topics. Throughout the digital age, businesses have amassed massive paper trails on their websites and social media accounts. With a small amount of legwork, consumers can easily comb through a company’s receipts to see which brands are offering lip service and which ones genuinely care. Any inauthentic or inaccurate statements about your commitment to diversity or equal rights can quickly be debunked, ridiculed, and shared virally across the internet. Authenticity in marketing has always been a best practice, but it becomes even more crucial in this time of social unrest and Covid-19. Campaigns about current events and social issues leave companies vulnerable to a different and deeper level of scrutiny. For example, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon released a commercial that thanked its “heroic” employees and described the company’s dedication to keeping them healthy and safe. The ad seemed heartfelt, but it became clear that the company was not “walking the walk” when coupled with Amazon’s recent employee strikes over workplace safety concerns. Similarly, the NFL continues to struggle to authentically address racial injustice in America. For the past month, the league has been outspoken on social media about the horrors of systemic racism and police violence. But two short years ago, the NFL punished players for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of these same issues. Naturally, plenty of people have scrutinized their inconsistent stance. This is not a time for companies to share generic, hollow, or hypocritical sentiments. Doing so can ring inauthentic and like a publicity stunt instead of a genuine attempt at contributing to the conversation. Instead, it is a time to be humble, own up to any mistakes, and express a desire to grow. This level of humility and authenticity is what consumers want to see right now, and it will help companies continue to build trust over the long run. Companies that acknowledge what is going on in the world, and that honestly want to improving things, strike the right chord with their customers. Companies that practice corporate social responsibility, for instance, can attribute 40% of their public reputation to that CSR work. But authenticity can devolve into just lip service that companies hope will make them look good without having to do anything. I have seen it happen that way, and I understand the adverse effects it can have. To help brands maintain their campaigns’ authenticity and effectiveness during times of unrest, here are four tips I have seen work: Step beyond your company’s perspective. Marketing teams often craft campaigns in a vacuum. When developing their messaging and imagery, they rely heavily on internal expertise and perspectives because they know their products better than any outsider would. However, topics like global health and racial injustice likely fall outside of the average marketing team’s purview. When attempting to comment on these sensitive topics, incorporate perspectives from outside experts to maintain the thoughtfulness and sincerity of your messaging. Connect with brand leaders who have also had to adapt or overhaul their messaging and tactics during uncertain times. They usually have insights that can put the challenges you’re facing into perspective and help you avoid unexpected struggles in the future. In addition, pick the brain of your target audience to learn about what they want to hear and what will not work for them. These outsiders can hold a mirror up to your company, and allow you to see things more clearly. For marketing teams, turning to people outside the organization can also illuminate when groupthink is leading them astray. When I worked at Dell, for example, the company decided to ramp up its marketing efforts toward women. I was asked to join an internal task force to help create these campaigns, but I quickly recused myself from the situation once I realized the CMO — who happened to be a woman — was intent on pushing stereotypical messaging, emphasizing topics like fashion and diet. She and her team would not listen to people outside of the task force that voiced concerns and warned her about this ill-conceived messaging built on outdated tropes. After the campaign went live, she ended up losing her job because of the ensuing public backlash over the campaign’s content. Listen, process, and validate. When customers or employees voice concerns about your company’s response to Covid-19, racial injustice, or other current events, do more than listen to their feedback — work to process it critically. Pay close attention to the specific terminology they use and take it at face value. Do not try to read between the lines or defensively make assumptions about the way they feel. If you do, you are more likely to inject your biases and preconceptions into the mix. When crafting your response, mirror their phrasing and word choices to validate their concerns and show that you understand. Take the case of what recently happened at Starbucks. The company faced significant backlash after consumers learned the retailer would not allow employees to wear any attire that said “Black Lives Matter.” This policy appeared to contradict previous statements made by the company on antiracism and inclusion. Starbucks validated consumer concerns when they spoke out against the hypocrisy, and the brand recently announced it would manufacture and distribute 250,000 “Black Lives Matter” shirts to its employees. While the move from some companies would be to dig in and not back down from such a public display, I think Starbucks deciding not to dig its heels in here was the right move. By acknowledging the hypocrisy and vowing to do better, it saved face and allowed the company to start somewhat anew. Apologize without caveats or explanations. Do not underestimate the power of a sincere apology — even if the transgression occurred decades ago. Lucasfilm, for example, first came under fire in 1999 after creating Jar Jar Binks, a character many viewers believed to embody racist stereotypes. George Lucas has persistently denied any racist intent over the years, and he has refused to apologize for creating such a controversial character. With Jar Jar Binks back in the news recently, due to questions about the character’s appearing in an upcoming “Star Wars” TV project, Lucas has another opportunity to offer a sincere apology once and for all. Expressing genuine contrition does not include caveats or explanations, and it should not take a rotation in the news cycle to spark remorse. It accepts fault and places the onus on the brand rather than the people who feel offended. Even if you do not immediately understand or agree with the complaints against your company, take time to self-reflect and determine why an apology might be necessary. If you decide to express remorse publicly, admit your lack of understanding while explaining how you plan to educate yourself. Provide follow-up statements as you learn, evolve, and implement changes. Do not make a one-off statement. We have established that apologies are not enough in today’s age. With “cancel culture” as pervasive as it is, a one-time reaction is as good as letting an issue get ahead of you. Instead, treat apologies or mea culpas as the first steps of an ongoing dialogue designed to bring about thoughtful and meaningful progress. After you finish owning up to the issue and better educating yourself, demonstrate how you are continuing to grow and leave that development open. Look at household names like Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben’s, Cream of Wheat, Mrs. Butterworth’s, and Eskimo Pie — today, these brands are taking a (much needed) step forward by revisiting their divisive and antiquated trademark packaging. While, in a better world, this would have happened many years ago, it does show that they are trying to grow and create more inclusive products. What is powerful about the actions those brands are taking is that they are just that: actions. Statements without actionable follow-through are just hot air. In the best case scenario, they are ignored. In the worst case, your brand will face backlash and be worse off than if you stayed silent. Take the next logical step that shows that you can “walk the walk.” Following through doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive: If you value your essential workers, give them an hourly boost for facing increased hazardous conditions. If you value the environment, plant a tree. If you support your local community, give each employee paid time off to volunteer at their favorite charities. If you are invested in inclusion and improving racial equality, hire and recruit candidates from underrepresented communities. Make these gestures routine instead of opportunistic to show that you are invested in bringing about real change. Your company might not get it right 100% of the time, but sticking to your core values, communicating with care, and displaying a willingness to reevaluate your point of view will enable you to build trust with consumers while learning and growing alongside them."
"98",98,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/adapt-your-business-to-the-new-reality","marketing.txt","Even in severe economic downturns and recessions, some companies are able to gain advantage. In the past four downturns, 14% of large companies increased both their sales growth rate and their EBIT margin. A shock like the Covid-19 pandemic can produce lasting changes in customer behavior. To survive and thrive in a crisis, begin by examining how people are spending their time and money. Challenge traditional ideas and use data to actively seek out anomalies and surprises. Next, adjust your business model to reflect behavioral changes, considering what the new trends might mean for how you create and deliver value, whom you need to partner with, and who your customers should be. Finally, put your money where your analysis takes you and be prepared to make more-aggressive, dynamic investments. Even in severe economic downturns and recessions, some companies are able to gain advantage. In the past four downturns, 14% of companies increased both their sales growth rate and their EBIT margin. A shock like the Covid-19 pandemic can produce lasting changes in behavior, and those firms quickly spot the changes, adjust their business models to reflect them, and are not afraid to make investments. Examine the changes in the ways that people spend their time and money and the effects on the businesses involved. Then look at what the changes might mean for how you create and deliver value, who you need to partner with, and who your customers should be. Finally, be ready to put your money where your analysis takes you. It will be quite some time before  we understand the full impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the history of such shocks tells us two things. First, even in severe economic downturns and recessions, some companies are able to gain advantage. Among large firms doing business during the past four downturns, 14% increased both sales growth rate and EBIT margin.   Second, crises produce not just a plethora of temporary changes (mainly short-term shifts in demand) but also some lasting ones. For example, the 9/11 terrorist attacks caused only a temporary decline in air travel, but they brought about a lasting shift in societal attitudes about the trade-off between privacy and security, resulting in permanently higher levels of screening and surveillance. Similarly, the 2003 SARS outbreak in China is often credited with accelerating a structural shift to e-commerce, paving the way for the rise of Alibaba and other digital giants. In the following pages we’ll discuss how companies can reassess their growth opportunities in the new normal, reconfigure their business models to better realize those opportunities, and reallocate their capital more effectively. The Covid-19 pandemic has severely disrupted global consumption, forcing (and permitting) people to unlearn old habits and adopt new ones. A study on habit formation suggests that the average time for a new habit to form is 66 days, with a minimum of 21 days. As of this writing, the lockdown has already lasted long enough in many countries to significantly change habits that had been the foundation of demand and supply. Companies seeking to emerge from the crisis in a stronger position must develop a systematic understanding of changing habits. For many firms, that will require a new process for detecting and assessing shifts before they become obvious to all. The first step is to map the potential ramifications of behavioral trends to identify specific products or business opportunities that will most likely grow or contract as a result. 
  Consider how the pandemic has caused people to stay at home more. Implications include an increase in home office refurbishment, driving greater demand for products ranging from paint to printers. Unless we sensitize ourselves to new habits and their cascading indirect effects, we will fail to spot weak signals and miss opportunities to shape markets.   The next step is to categorize demand shifts using a simple 2×2 matrix, on the basis of whether they are likely to be short-term or long-term and whether they were existing trends before the crisis or have emerged since it began. The four quadrants distinguish among boosts (temporary departures from existing trends), displacements (temporary new trends), catalysts (accelerations of existing trends), and innovations (new lasting trends). Consider again the behavioral shift of “stay at home more,” which has had a serious impact on retail shopping. The question is, Will the shift away from retail stores to online be temporary, or will it be a structural change with permanent knock-on effects in other areas, such as commercial real estate? We would place shopping in the catalyst quadrant. The pandemic has amplified and accelerated an existing trend rather than created a new one; people were shifting to e-shopping before the lockdown. But the shift is structural rather than temporary, because the scale and duration of the enforced switch, coupled with the generally positive performance of the channel, suggests that in many shopping categories customers will see no need to switch back. So retailers must shape their strategies to the new normal. Indeed, before the lockdown many retailers were responding to the digital challenge by redefining the purpose of the physical store, often by reimagining shopping as not a chore but an attractive social experience. This framework can therefore be used to highlight which trends to follow and which to shape more aggressively. Companies cannot pursue all possibilities and should not try to. To get an idea of which ones to back, ask yourself whether any shift in demand is temporary or permanent. Many of the immediately observed shifts in response to Covid-19 were driven by fear of infection or compliance with official directives, and therefore were most likely temporary. But others were accompanied by greater convenience or better economics, so they are more likely to stick. Any analysis of growth opportunities must go well beyond a simple categorization of what you already know. You need to challenge your ideas about what’s happening in your traditional business domains by taking a fresh, careful look at the data. This requires that you actively seek out anomalies and surprises. Anomalies usually emerge from data that is both granular (revealing patterns hidden by top-line averages) and high-frequency (allowing emerging patterns to be identified rapidly). As behavior changed with the outbreak of Covid-19, for example, rich sources included data on foot traffic and credit card spending. An analysis showed that the recent drop-off in cinema attendance occurred before theaters were shut down in the United States. This, combined with an existing trend of declining attendance, suggested that the shift was consumer-driven and perhaps likely to persist in the absence of innovation. Live sports attendance, in contrast, declined only when events were officially canceled, suggesting a stronger possibility of a behavioral rebound. In the military, a technique for discovering what you don’t know is to use the “eyes of the enemy.” Military leaders ask themselves, What is the enemy paying attention to? and then shift their own attention accordingly to illuminate potential blind spots and alternative perspectives. The same can be applied to industry mavericks and competitors: Who is doing well? What market segments are your rivals focused on? What products or services are they launching? The same principle can be extended to customers: Which ones are exhibiting new behaviors? Which have stayed loyal? What new crisis-induced needs do customers have, and what are they paying attention to? It can even be applied to countries: What patterns emerged in China, where both the outbreak and the recovery came ahead of those in Western nations? In your own organization, ask: Which workplace innovations are taking hold in leading firms? What new needs are employees responding to? What opportunities do they represent that could potentially be developed and rolled out more broadly? Armed with an understanding of where your opportunities lie, you can now move to the next step: shaping your business model to capture them. Your new business model will be shaped by the demand and supply shifts relevant to your industry. Many manufacturing companies, for example, will be profoundly affected by the structural and likely permanent shocks to globalization brought on by the pandemic. With big markets such as the United States raising trade barriers, for example, many companies will need to reshore critical components in their supply chains—from R&D down to assembly. To figure out what business model the new normal requires, you need to ask basic questions about how you create and deliver value, who you’ll partner with, and who your customers will be. As an example, let’s look at how retail shopping businesses should be adjusting to the demand shift to digital. The value that many retailers provide to customers traditionally has come from the quality of their in-store service. Consider the Chinese cosmetics company Lin Qingxuan. It suffered a 90% collapse in store sales after the outbreak, when many locations were forced to close and others saw foot traffic plummet. In response, the company developed a strategy for digital engagement with customers that would replace the store experience: It turned the company’s in-store beauty advisers into online influencers. The success of this move has prompted more investment in digital channels. Thanks to that and similar changes, Lin Qingxuan’s increased online sales have more than made up for the fall in store sales during the crisis, notably in hard-hit Wuhan. The pandemic-induced shift to digital shopping has made customers and firms more dependent on big digital platforms, including Google, Amazon, and Apple in the West and Alibaba and Tencent in Asia, along with a newer group of aggressive rivals such as China’s Meituan, Russia’s Yandex, and Singapore’s Grab. Increasingly, a firm’s competitive space will be determined by the platform it works with. As retailers seek to carve out a distinctive position for themselves, they will have to learn to work with such platforms to innovate and shape their value propositions. For example, Lin Qingxuan’s conversion of shop assistants into online influencers involved working in close partnership with Alibaba. The choice of platform to partner with should be driven by its ability to help you develop the strategic digital capabilities and resources you need to provide value online. Digitization provides scope for niche businesses to expand their markets, perhaps across borders or into adjacencies not currently well served. Take the case of VIPKid, one of China’s unicorns, which links teachers in English-speaking countries with Chinese children who want to learn English. With teaching switching from physical to online, the company has seen an opportunity to expand and deepen its links both with students in China and with teachers in the United States, Canada, and the UK. Niche companies in other industries may find potential for online offerings in segments already being served by strong digital providers, because of a selective wariness toward Big Tech that has become more apparent during the crisis. The distribution platform Bookshop.org, for example, links up independent bookstores that are worried about being exploited or ignored by Amazon. My Local Token also taps into a desire for alternatives to Big Tech, providing a cryptocurrency that enables local merchants to lower transaction fees, build customer loyalty, and reinvigorate small businesses. Ventures like these, whose value proposition is rooted in opposition to the network-maximizing ethos of Big Tech firms, could be described as Alt-Tech. Tim Boelaars For the vast majority of companies, responding to demand shifts will involve at least some digital transformation—and probably a significant level of it. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella observed at the end of April, “We have seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months” among enterprise customers—and the result of those investments will persist long after the crisis. Employees at companies across the board have adjusted to working remotely and collaborating via video conferences. Many of those habits and patterns will stick. Together, these factors explain why, in a survey of Fortune 500 CEOs, 63% said the Covid-19 crisis would accelerate their technological investment despite financial pressures. Only 6% said it would slow it down. But to make a difference, those IT investments should focus on specific business-model innovations to address new opportunities, rather than increase the use of digital technologies in general. It may be psychologically hard to do during a crisis, when cash flows are stressed, but now is precisely the time to take a few well-considered risks. Research shows that the most successful companies not only invest more than their peers in new opportunities but also put their eggs in fewer baskets, devoting more than 90% of net spending to segments with higher growth and returns. These companies recognize that a crisis offers an opportunity to carve out a new competitive position. Unfortunately, many companies are still defaulting to traditional habits of “peanut-buttering” new funding across the business and, when necessary, making horizontal cuts rather than targeted ones. According to BCG’s survey of leading firms, as of May 2020 only 39% of companies had modified their investment and capital allocation plans to target new growth drivers, and of that minority, only half had made investments in new business models. Rather than hoard cash, CEOs need to engage in more-aggressive capital investment. To avoid that trap, evaluate your capital investment projects along two dimensions: their estimated value tomorrow, after taking into account the impact of demand shifts, and the amount of money needed to keep them alive today in light of often constrained operational cash flows. You can do this at the business unit level, but ideally you should dive deeper to examine specific operations or initiatives. Once you’ve completed this exercise, you’ll most likely realize that you need to radically reallocate your capital investment. In the current environment, larger corporations that are willing to entertain some risks are likely to benefit the most. Financial markets and institutions will be less ready or able to provide capital to smaller firms and start-ups right now. This means that large, established firms with relatively strong cash flows, and more access to capital as a result, will be well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by shifts in demand. But large companies need to be prepared to take on those risks. Rather than hoard cash and agonize about what might befall a particular sector or geographic region, CEOs should engage in more-aggressive, dynamic capital investment. Heightened uncertainty means that organizations cannot accurately predict which businesses will be most successful tomorrow, so they need to take an experimental approach and take steps to diversify their portfolios to include a range of potential bets. The rapid pace of change means that they should frequently update their portfolios, reallocating funding as needed while making sure that they are balanced over time and fit the companies’ long-term strategic priorities. American Express has set the standard in this regard. During the 2008 global financial crisis, Amex was severely threatened by increasing defaults, decreasing consumer spending, and limited access to funding. The company launched a restructuring program to streamline the organization and reduce cash drain, and it entered into the deposit-gathering business in order to raise more capital. Those moves freed up or generated cash that Amex then directed toward longer-term investments in new partnerships and technology, which reimagined the company as not just a card provider but a platform-supported services company. As then-CEO Ken Chenault noted, “Even as we’ve cut operating expenses, we have continued to fund major growth initiatives.” As a result, Amex’s market capitalization grew more than 10-fold after the crisis.  In times of crisis, it’s easy for organizations to default to old habits—but those are often the times in which new approaches are most valuable. As companies position themselves for the new normal, they cannot afford to be constrained by traditional information sources, business models, and capital allocation behaviors. Instead they must highlight anomalies and challenge mental models, revamp their business models, and invest their capital dynamically to not only survive the crisis but also thrive in the post-crisis world."
"99",99,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/cultural-innovation","marketing.txt","Companies struggle with innovation because they put all their chips on one innovation paradigm—what Holt calls better mousetraps. This is innovation as conceived by engineers and economists—a race to create the killer value proposition. It wins on functionality, convenience, reliability, price, or user experience. Fortunately, building better mousetraps is not the only way to innovate. In consumer markets, innovation often proceeds according to a logic Holt calls cultural innovation. Better-mousetraps innovation is organized by quantitative ambitions: Outdo your competitors on existing notions of value. Cultural innovation operates according to qualitative ambitions: Change the understanding of what is considered valuable. Holt’s research and consulting reveal the strategic principles that allow companies to pursue cultural innovation. In this article he explores those principles using the stories of how the Ford Explorer reinvented the family car and how Blue Buffalo reinvented the ideology of dog food. Most companies take a “better mousetraps” approach to innovation, improving a product’s functionality—with only average results. A few take a cultural innovation approach instead, first identifying a weakness in the existing category and then reinventing the category’s ideology and symbolism. The Ford Explorer, for example, replaced the boring “mom mobile” minivan as America’s favorite family car with a promise of excitement, adventure, and glamour—even though the SUV wasn’t a technically superior vehicle. Building the next billion-dollar innovation is an  irresistible goal. To get a leg up, many companies now emulate the innovation model perfected in the tech sector. Procter & Gamble, for example, pursues what it calls constructive disruption. The company has designed its innovation process like a start-up’s, with a venture lab that pulls in tech entrepreneurs and a lean probe-and-learn prototyping process.   That approach is not working. The reality is that in most consumer markets, innovation is a slow, incremental grind—extending master brands, adding a new bell or whistle, tweaking a formula. P&G’s star innovations—such as a smart Pampers diaper that signals when a change is needed—aren’t exactly threatening to become the next billion-dollar product. And when companies do swing for the fences, they rarely achieve good results. Take Coca-Cola, which has long prioritized building a business in coffee. After years of research and testing, the company bet big on two innovations—Far Coast Coffee (a retail chain premised on sustainability) and Coca-Cola BlãK (Coke mixed with coffee). Both ideas failed badly, so the company eventually bought Costa Coffee, a British coffeehouse chain, at a steep price: $5 billion. This problem is not an organizational one. Companies struggle because they put all their chips on one innovation paradigm—what I call better mousetraps. As Ralph Waldo Emerson noted long ago, “Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.” This is innovation as conceived by engineers and economists—a race to create the killer value proposition. It wins on functionality, convenience, reliability, price, or user experience. Better-mousetraps innovation is often the right bet if you’re a tech company. Thousands of experts, seminars, and boot camps provide advice to help you on your way. But what about companies that operate in markets where new technology is less consequential or impossible to defend? For many of them, confronted with a pattern of poor return on investment, chasing better mousetraps seems like an exhausting and expensive matter of running in place. Fortunately, building better mousetraps is not the only way to innovate. In consumer markets, innovation often proceeds according to a logic I call cultural innovation. Think of Starbucks, Patagonia, Jack Daniel’s, Ben & Jerry’s, and Vitaminwater. Remember, innovation is in the eye of the beholder. When those brands broke through, consumers viewed them as major innovations, although a better-mousetraps perspective would reject that assessment. In each case people responded to the brand’s ideology—a reimagining of the category that transformed the value proposition. Cultural innovations are embodied in distinctive products or services, to be sure, but also in founders’ speeches, packaging, ingredients, retail design, media coverage, and even philanthropy. The result? Those brands don’t compete in the value-proposition race, trying to lead the category as it’s currently defined; they play a different game. Better-mousetraps innovation is guided by quantitative ambitions: Outdo your competitors on existing notions of value. Cultural innovation operates according to qualitative ambitions: Change the understanding of what is considered valuable. I’ve spent the past 20 years researching and advising organizations on numerous cultural innovations. My work reveals the strategic principles that allow companies to pursue them—principles completely different from those used to build better mousetraps. Buying a sport utility vehicle would have been an oddball idea for American middle-class families as late as 1989, but by 1995 the SUV was their unquestionable favorite, thanks largely to the Explorer—the pioneering vehicle that earned Ford roughly $30 billion in operating profit over its first decade. A spartan enclosed truck, the Explorer was yanked from its traditional role as functional transport on farms and ranches to become the aspirational choice of suburban families for commuting, delivering youngsters to school, and heading out to the mall. It succeeded wildly despite violating the rules of better mousetraps at every turn. It was a classic cultural innovation, targeting a fatal flaw in the family car culture of that era. The modern station wagon was a staple of the postwar nuclear-family ideal. All the major makes and models competed within this culture of suburban functionality. In the 1980s minivans rapidly replaced station wagons, winning on important benefits—plenty of seats, great storage, easy entrance and egress—that allowed families to haul kids and their friends around town and on summer trips. Johannes Max Brückner The minivan’s pragmatic design and ubiquity created a big symbolic problem. Vehicles are judged as much for the identity they project as for function: Status, sophistication, and masculinity all play a role in creating “premium” cars, which at the time were predominantly imports. Minivans came to represent the quotidian life of suburban parents, mocked as the centerpiece of a boring existence organized by “mom mobile” routines. Parents began to yearn for a car that would replace this stigma with an aspirational identity. In the 1980s the Reagan-era revival of America’s frontier ideology, which championed rugged individualists taming wild nature, inspired a critical mass of urban and suburban residents to reimagine the family car as a swashbuckling vehicle for off-road adventures. The offerings at the time were a poor fit for families: The Jeep Cherokee (XJ) and Chevy’s massive Suburban were rough-driving trucks that lacked the amentities of passenger cars. The Ford Bronco and the Chevy S-10 Blazer offered only two doors. Nonetheless, many families were willing to forgo the minivan’s creature comforts for the symbolic value that trucks bestowed. It took the incumbent automakers the better part of a decade to engage with this opportunity. They were lucky to be in an industry with very high barriers to entry; otherwise they would no doubt have been beaten to market by a challenger brand. Eventually the big three domestic truck players—Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler Jeep—raced to bring a comfortable, luxuriously equipped four-door SUV to market. The winner would be the brand that managed to seduce parents into thinking about family cars in a new way. Jeep had the initial advantage, given its potent off-road pedigree, and its new Grand Cherokee, launched soon after the Explorer, won many plaudits. However, Jeep’s idea of a family SUV was a straight take on the frontier-adventure myth, showcasing performance on wilderness outings—a myth better aimed at young single men than at upscale families. The Explorer was launched with advertisements that dramatized a new ideal of family life, rejecting the dull suburban minivan. Ford made two crucial changes to the frontier-adventure myth, both of which connected powerfully with parents. Instead of Jeep’s macho excursions, the company offered a vision of families communing in the wilderness. Ads showed them whisking off to remote places in an Explorer to make memories while gathering under the stars, kids happily trading in their tech for spiritual contentment. And parents who owned an Explorer got to have a life too. Ads showed them escaping on urban adventures—eating at boutique restaurants or attending the theater. They might live in the suburbs, but they could still enjoy a cosmopolitan life. In the Reagan era people reimagined the family car as a swashbuckling vehicle. Families flocked to the Explorer. Sure, most of the time they were still hauling groceries and dropping kids off at soccer practice, just as they would have done with a minivan. But they were buying into a myth. Driving an Explorer allowed them to feel they’d finally escaped the world of mom mobiles for a more adventurous life. In the postwar era, safety was a modest concern, despite Ralph Nader’s best efforts. Even getting people to use seat belts was a challenge. By the early 1990s, though, car safety had captured the public’s imagination owing to two big better-mousetraps innovations—airbags and antilock brakes—that were promoted heavily in auto advertising and the media. Ford discovered early on that people believed that the huge size and weight of SUVs made them uniquely safe and that their off-road capabilities meant they were especially skid-resistant in bad weather. So the company crafted a sales pitch to reinforce that perception. The car’s elevated seats conferred a feeling of power and invincibility, particularly for women. When couples came to a dealership, the salesperson would ask the woman to test-drive the Explorer so that she could appreciate the feeling of safety from the high perch. Ford was able to persuade customers that they were buying the safest car on the road. The Explorer was a great success, comparable to celebrated Silicon Valley innovations in terms of its market impact and profitability. Yet its breakthrough is incomprehensible when viewed through the lens of better mousetraps. The vehicle was not an engineering advance—quite the opposite. It relied on dated technology. Explorers accelerated lethargically. They were top-heavy and cornered poorly. They cost a lot and were far more expensive to maintain than minivans. And they were gas-guzzlers that generated enormous increases in CO2. But families were willing to pay near-luxury prices because the SUV perfectly addressed the symbolic problem in the market’s status quo. Let’s look at a second case—Blue Buffalo dog food—to recognize the key steps in cultural innovation and to explain why incumbents often fail at it. For decades Nestlé Purina, Mars, and Procter & Gamble dominated the profitable U.S. dog food category with powerful brands, distribution muscle, strong R&D, and big marketing budgets. Yet all three were beaten badly by Blue Buffalo, a tiny start-up, which was so successful that General Mills eventually bought it for $8 billion, while Procter & Gamble threw in the towel and sold its entire pet food division to Mars for less than $3 billion. Blue Buffalo bested the established brands by reinventing dog food culture. Here’s how. Markets are belief systems embraced by those who participate in a category: companies, consumers, and the media. To understand your category’s culture, think like a sociologist. Step back and make the familiar strange. What are the category’s taken-for-granted organizing principles? What is the dominant ideology? Blue Buffalo convinced millions of owners it was a necessity for true dog lovers. Before Purina launched the modern industrial dog food category, in the 1920s, most American families fed their dogs table scraps. Purina’s standardized extruded kibble made inroads with consumers, and by the postwar era the company had adopted the mass-marketing techniques pioneered by food manufacturers such as Kraft and General Mills. Its ads featured heart-tugging images of cute dogs and their loving owners. The implicit message was “Purina is the biggest, best-known dog food company, so of course you can trust us to make food that will keep your dog healthy and energetic.” Ingredients were rarely mentioned. The category’s first cultural innovation came in the 1970s, on the heels of media hype about scientific findings that certain vitamins and superfoods could keep people healthy. (Fiber and antioxidants were hot topics.) Cultural innovators, led by Hill’s Science Diet and Iams, championed a new, scientific dog food ideology. The companies produced separate products for the various stages of a dog’s life. Marketing featured veterinarians announcing cutting-edge formulas based on the best nutritional science. These products were sold in vets’ offices—the ultimate sign of medical credibility. Purina launched a fast-follower grocery brand, Purina ONE, with ads featuring scientists in lab coats and packaging full of medical terminology. These new brands taught owners to value dog food primarily for its nutritional benefits and offered them a scientific lexicon that “proved” quality nutrition. They encouraged owners to view the making of pet food as a complex scientific endeavor. The ingredients, however, remained hidden in small print. Categories’ cultures eventually develop a fatal flaw, and cultural innovators pinpoint the emerging vulnerabilities. Throughout the early 2000s America’s industrial-scientific food culture was subject to damning critiques in the media and by dozens of insurgent anti-industrial food movements. Dog owners began to feel similar concerns; they questioned whether those bags of kibble made by big companies were actually good for their pets. Then, in 2007, thousands of dogs and cats died after eating contaminated pet food. The media reported that one ingredient, wheat gluten contaminated with melamine, was bulk-sourced from China. Owners had had no idea that they were feeding their dogs wheat gluten or that it was imported from China. They began to take far more interest in the actual ingredients of dog food. Category transformations are usually prefigured by ideas and practices worked out at the margins. When cracks form in a category’s culture, a cultural vanguard often appears before big companies show up. Innovators study the vanguard closely, and even participate in it, to find a strategic direction for their challenger ideology and the symbols required to bring it to life. A small “natural” dog food subculture, separate from the national brands, had developed in prior decades. Alternative-health companies and their avid customers believed that healthful dog food should emulate what dogs ate before they became domesticated. The subculture’s brands, which were sold in boutiques and natural-foods stores, were very expensive and marketed to niche customers. They made little effort to win converts from the big industrial-scientific brands. Blue Buffalo upended industry giants like Purina and P&G by reconfiguring the category’s ideology, using potent symbols. As a result, it transformed the value proposition for dog food. Health: The most nutritious dog food is made by big corporations with scientific expertiseIdentity: I’m a caring owner who buys the best food for my dog’s health Health: Nutritious dog food is like human food but in a convenient, nonperishable formIdentity: To be a credibly caring owner, I need to upgrade to ingredients that I’d feed my family The brands lionized whole ingredients and transparent supply chains. They were all about real meat, poultry, and fish, along with whole-food carbohydrates (sweet potatoes, rice), and they fastidiously avoided anything artificial. The subculture encouraged customers to beware of “fillers” (processed starches such as corn, wheat, and soy) and meat by-products. Their packaging highlighted ingredients rather than happy dogs and loving owners. Cultural innovators source materials from the vanguard to build a new brand concept. The natural-foods subculture’s ideology was hidden: Alternative-health zealots talked to one another and used rhetoric aimed at the already converted. Blue Buffalo, which was founded in 2002 by a Connecticut family that had become obsessed with the link between pet diet and health after their Airedale terrier (named Blue) died of cancer, acted as the subculture’s proselytizer. The brand challenged the weak assumption that anchored the industrial-scientific ideology—that kibble was surely nutritious, even though owners had no idea what the compressed brown pellets were made from. In doing so, it created a litmus test for responsible dog ownership. Blue Buffalo pushed owners to evaluate dog food as food. Those other kibble brands were full of industrial products that pet owners would never eat. People needed to take control and make sure their dog food contained healthful ingredients, no different from what they’d feed their families. Blue Buffalo’s pet food was made with the same ingredients as a good human diet, so by switching brands, owners could ditch their newfound guilt and claim an enlightened identity—they really did feed their dogs nutritious food. Cultural innovations are brought to life by a combination of symbols that dramatize them in the most compelling manner. They select symbols from the marketing mix that work together, attack the Achilles’ heel, and draw a clear contrast with the category’s dominant culture. Blue Buffalo leveraged the leading symbols of the natural-foods subculture and created additional symbols to illustrate the notion that Blue Buffalo was, in effect, the same healthful food that owners themselves ate, converted into a compact, convenient, nonperishable form. The company repurposed the subculture’s four foundational claims—real meat is the number one ingredient, no meat by-products, no fillers, nothing artificial—and used them in dozens of low-budget ads, produced to look like documentaries: Owners gathered in a living room, comparing notes on their preferred dog foods. Some were taken aback to read that their favorite brand contained “chicken by-product,” while Blue Buffalo users proudly proclaimed that the first ingredient in theirs was deboned chicken. The company taught owners to read the label the next time they considered buying a bag of kibble. And Blue Buffalo developed its own mini-kibble: LifeSource Bits—small, dark-purple (rather than brown) balls made with superfoods such as blueberries, flaxseed, cranberries, and kelp. The company pushed owners to draw a connection between what their families ate to avoid chronic disease and what would give their dogs the same kind of protection. As Blue Buffalo’s challenge worked its magic, millions of owners decided to spend far more on dog food to avoid guilt. They bought into an entirely new value proposition: a new nutritional benefit (healthful dog food contains the same ingredients that healthful human food does) and a new identity benefit (switching to Blue Buffalo proved that they were truly caring owners). Despite the company’s strategic brilliance, Blue Buffalo should never have been able to build a business that was worth $8 billion. The three incumbents completely dominated the market and should have prevailed over the upstart. All three invested heavily in new brands and line extensions, but they struck out because, working with a better-mousetraps mindset, they misunderstood the nature of Blue Buffalo’s cultural innovation. P&G believed that Blue Buffalo was gaining ground by making a big deal of a simple “new and improved” ingredients claim. The company assumed that if it matched those ingredients with a line extension, owners would choose the trusted brand over Blue Buffalo. So P&G launched Iams Healthy Naturals, featuring two of Blue Buffalo’s ingredients claims (no fillers, no artificial ingredients), with a big ad campaign and promotions. When that attempt failed, the company tried a more expensive iteration, Iams Naturals, which had meat as the number one ingredient. But to no avail. What went wrong? Both products relied on brand names that tried to knit together the dominant industrial-scientific ideology (which Iams had championed for decades) with the natural dog food subculture—and the result was culturally incoherent. Iams came off as an impostor. It didn’t help that the company’s advertising campaigns used exactly the same trope (loving owner playing with energetic pet) that industrial-scientific brands had relied on for 40 years instead of showcasing ingredients, a key concern in the natural pet food subculture. P&G unwittingly sabotaged its rebuttal with its confused symbolism. Purina, too, launched a line extension—Purina ONE Beyond—to defend against Blue Buffalo. The effort led with not one but two industrial-scientific brand names (Purina and ONE), inadvertently signaling to consumers that this was not a credible natural dog food. In addition, the company (which fancied purpose-driven branding at the time) decided to tie Beyond to a purpose. It knew from trends research that upscale owners favored green products, so it decided that Beyond would be the dog food that helped save the planet. An anthemic launch ad, depicting a glowing field, proclaimed, “We believe together we can make the world a better place one pet at a time.” The problem was that environmental sustainability had nothing to do with Blue Buffalo’s challenge, which centered on nutrition and health. Dog owners simply ignored Beyond. Incumbents’ standard response when threatened by cultural innovation is to buy the threatening company or a close competitor. In 2007 Mars did just that by acquiring Nutro, a strong brand in the natural pet food subculture and a credible challenger to Blue Buffalo. That was a promising move. To make it work, though, Mars would have had to shift Nutro marketing to attack industrial dog food, copying Blue Buffalo. It’s unlikely that Mars ever considered that move, which would have meant attacking its biggest brand, Pedigree. Instead managers did just the opposite: They converted Nutro to a mass-marketing approach using ads little different from those of Iams. P&G, Purina, and Mars never understood that they were fighting an existential battle to sustain their brands’ authority as experts on healthful, nutritious dog food—not just racing to clean up their ingredients panels. As a result, Blue Buffalo convinced millions of dog owners that a product once viewed as a fussy extravagance was actually a necessity for people who truly loved their dogs. Cultural innovation has often been an entrepreneur’s gambit. Even when incumbents happen upon extraordinary cultural opportunities that should be easy to spot and straightforward to execute on, they fail time and again. If companies are to succeed at cultural innovation, they need to avoid three pitfalls. Even if they don’t think in such terms, companies are masters of their category’s existing culture. They have to be to excel at their current business. Their metrics and planning focus on it. As a result, managers come to perceive the category as an immutable reality, even though it’s actually built on a fragile consensus. If you’re trapped in the present tense, it is extremely difficult to examine the category from the outside and identify its emerging flaws. These ideological blinders explain why hundreds of highly trained professionals at the biggest pet food companies responded inadequately when Blue Buffalo attacked their billion-dollar businesses. The better-mousetraps paradigm assumes that a product’s features are objective characteristics that consumers value. As a result, products are construed in building-block terms—as stacks of features that together create a value proposition. Innovation, then, requires improvements to particular features that consumers value. But features aren’t just building blocks—they can be malleable cultural symbols of an ideology. The incumbent dog food companies assumed that Blue Buffalo was simply offering trendy new ingredients claims. But in fact those claims became “evidence” in Blue Buffalo’s whistleblower project, revealing that owners had been hoodwinked by the industrial-scientific brands. The better-mousetraps paradigm views innovations as great functional achievements, but that overlooks a critical component of many innovations: bolstering aspects of consumers’ identity. Ford, as we have seen, persuaded customers that they could trade in the dreary suburban minivan lifestyle for outdoor adventure and sophisticated city excursions. Blue Buffalo consumers traded up to garner status as enlightened dog owners. In 1995 Clay Christensen introduced one of the most influential ideas in business: disruptive innovation. He famously asked why great companies fail when they’re doing everything right. Christensen’s answer: Incumbents focus on serving the most-demanding customers with the best products because margins are high. So entrants provide simple, cheap, “underperforming” solutions to low-end niches. Incumbents tend to ignore segments with poor margins and “inferior” products until it’s too late. If one were to turn Christensen’s advice into a mantra, it might be “Think like a cheapskate.” But that’s not the only innovator’s dilemma. Great companies are also disrupted by innovations that don’t involve new technologies; a cheap, low-performance product; or a price-sensitive target. Incumbents are so intent on winning the category as it’s currently defined that they fail to identify cracks in its foundation. Cultural innovators outmaneuver them because they look for opportunities to blow up the dominant ideology in favor of a new regime. So for incumbents to innovate, they’ll need to adopt a second mantra: “Think like a cultural entrepreneur.” Douglas Holt is the founder and president of the Cultural Strategy Group and was formerly a professor at Harvard Business School and the University of Oxford. He is the author of How Brands Become Icons: The Principles of Cultural Branding (Harvard Business School Press, 2004)."
"100",100,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-to-win-with-machine-learning","marketing.txt","Many companies can dramatically improve their products and services by using machine learning—an application of artificial intelligence that involves generating predictions from data inputs. Amazon, Google, and other tech giants are already experts at taking advantage of this technology. Smaller enterprises and late entrants, however, may be unsure how to do likewise to gain market share for themselves. This article suggests that early movers will be successful if they have enough training data to make accurate predictions and if they can improve their algorithms by quickly incorporating feedback derived from customers’ behavior. Latecomers will need a different approach to be competitive: The secret for them is to find untapped sources of training or feedback data, or to differentiate themselves by tailoring predictions to a special niche. As more companies deploy machine learning for AI-enabled products and services, they face the challenge of carving out a defensible market position, especially if they are latecomers. The most successful AI users capture a good pool of training data early and then exploit feedback data to open up a value gap—in terms of prediction quality—between themselves and later movers. Latecomers can still secure a foothold if they can find sources of superior training data or feedback data, or if they tailor their predictions to a specific niche. The past decade has brought tremendous advances  in an exciting dimension of artificial intelligence—machine learning. This technique for taking data inputs and turning them into predictions has enabled tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google to dramatically improve their products. It has also spurred start-ups to launch new products and platforms, sometimes even in competition with Big Tech.   Consider BenchSci, a Toronto-based company that seeks to speed the drug development process. It aims to make it easier for scientists to find needles in haystacks—to zero in on the most crucial information embedded in pharma companies’ internal databases and in the vast wealth of published scientific research. To get a new drug candidate into clinical trials, scientists must run costly and time-consuming experiments. BenchSci realized that scientists could conduct fewer of these—and achieve greater success—if they applied better insights from the huge number of experiments that had already been run. Indeed, BenchSci found that if scientists took advantage of machine learning that read, classified, and then presented insights from scientific research, they could halve the number of experiments normally required to advance a drug to clinical trials. More specifically, they could use the technology to find the right biological reagents—essential substances for influencing and measuring protein expression. Identifying those by combing through the published literature rather than rediscovering them from scratch helps significantly cut the time it takes to produce new drug candidates. That adds up to potential savings of over $17 billion annually, which, in an industry where the returns to R&D have become razor-thin, could transform the market. In addition, many lives could be saved by bringing new drugs to market more quickly. What is remarkable here is that BenchSci, in its specialized domain, is doing something akin to what Google has been doing for the whole of the internet: using machine learning to lead in search. Just as Google can help you figure out how to fix your dishwasher and save you a long trip to the library or a costly repair service, BenchSci helps scientists identify a suitable reagent without incurring the trouble or expense of excessive research and experimentation. Previously, scientists would often use Google or PubMed to search the literature (a process that took days), then read the literature (again spending days), and then order and test three to six reagents before choosing one (over a period of weeks). Now they search BenchSci in minutes and then order and test one to three reagents before choosing one (conducting fewer tests over fewer weeks). Many companies are already working with AI and are aware of the practical steps for integrating it into their operations and leveraging its power. But as that proficiency grows, companies will need to consider a broader issue: How do you take advantage of machine learning to create a defensible moat around the business—to create something that competitors can’t easily imitate? In BenchSci’s case, for instance, will its initial success attract competition from Google—and if so, how does BenchSci retain its lead? In the following pages, we explain how companies entering industries with an AI-enabled product or service can build a sustainable competitive advantage and raise entry barriers against latecomers. We note that moving early can often be a big plus, but it’s not the whole story. As we discuss, late adopters of the new technology can still advance—or at least recover some lost ground—by finding a niche. Businesses use machine learning to recognize patterns and then make predictions—about what will appeal to customers, improve operations, or help make a product better. Before you can build a strategy around such predictions, however, you must understand the inputs necessary for the prediction process, the challenges involved in getting those inputs, and the role of feedback in enabling an algorithm to make better predictions over time. A prediction, in the context of machine learning, is an information output that comes from entering some data and running an algorithm. For example, when your mobile navigation app serves up a prediction about the best route between two points, it uses input data on traffic conditions, speed limits, road size, and other factors. An algorithm is then employed to predict the fastest way to go and the time that will take. The key challenge with any prediction process is that training data—the inputs you need in order to start getting reasonable outcomes—has to be either created (by, say, hiring experts to classify things) or procured from existing sources (say, health records). Some kinds of data are easy to acquire from public sources (think of weather and map information). Consumers may also willingly supply personal data if they perceive a benefit from doing so. Fitbit and Apple Watch users, for example, allow the companies to gather metrics about their exercise level, calorie intake, and so forth through devices that users wear to manage their health and fitness. Moving early can often be a big plus, but it’s not the whole story. Obtaining training data to enable predictions can be difficult, however, if it requires the cooperation of a large number of individuals who do not directly benefit from providing it. For instance, a navigation app can collect data about traffic conditions by tracking users and getting reports from them. This allows the app to identify likely locations for traffic jams and to alert other drivers who are heading toward them. But drivers already caught in the snarls get little direct payoff from participating, and they may be troubled by the idea that the app knows where they are at any moment (and is potentially recording their movements). If people in traffic jams decline to share their data or actually switch off their geolocators, the app’s ability to warn users of traffic problems will be compromised. Another challenge may be the need to periodically update training data. This isn’t always an issue; it won’t apply if the basic context in which the prediction was made stays constant. Radiology, for example, analyzes human physiology, which is generally consistent from person to person and over time. Thus, after a certain point, the marginal value of an extra record in the training database is almost zero. However, in other cases algorithms may need to be frequently updated with completely new data reflecting changes in the underlying environment. With navigational apps, for instance, new roads or traffic circles, renamed streets, and similar changes will render the app’s predictions less accurate over time unless the maps that form part of the initial training data are updated. In many situations, algorithms can be continuously improved through the use of feedback data, which is obtained by mapping actual outcomes to the input data that generated predictions of those outcomes. This tool is particularly helpful in situations where there can be considerable variation within clearly defined boundaries. For instance, when your phone uses an image of you for security, you will have initially trained the phone to recognize you. But your face can change significantly. You may or may not be wearing glasses. You may have gotten a new hairstyle, put on makeup, or gained or lost weight. Thus the prediction that you are you may become less reliable if the phone relies solely on the initial training data. But what actually happens is that the phone updates its algorithm using all the images you provide each time you unlock it. Creating these kinds of feedback loops is far from straightforward in dynamic contexts and where feedback cannot be easily categorized and sourced. Feedback data for the smartphone face-recognition app, for example, creates better predictions only if the sole person inputting facial data is the phone’s owner. If other people look similar enough to get into the phone and continue using it, the phone’s prediction that the user is the owner becomes unreliable. It can also be dangerously easy to introduce biases into machine learning, especially if multiple factors are in play. Suppose a lender uses an AI-enabled process to assess the credit risk of loan applicants, considering their income level, employment history, demographic characteristics, and so forth. If the training data for the algorithm discriminates against a certain group—say, people of color—the feedback loop will perpetuate or even accentuate that bias, making it increasingly likely that applicants of color are rejected. Feedback is almost impossible to incorporate safely into an algorithm without carefully defined parameters and reliable, unbiased sources. In many ways, building a sustainable business in machine learning is much like building a sustainable business in any industry. You have to come in with a sellable product, carve out a defensible early position, and make it harder for anyone to come in behind you. Whether you can do that depends on your answers to three questions: At the get-go, a prediction machine needs to generate predictions that are good enough to be commercially viable. The definition of “good enough” might be set by regulation (for example, an AI for making medical diagnoses must meet government standards), usability (a chatbot has to work smoothly enough for callers to respond to the machine rather than wait to speak to a human in the call center), or competition (a company seeking to enter the internet search market needs a certain level of predictive accuracy to compete with Google). One barrier to entry, therefore, is the amount of time and effort involved in creating or accessing sufficient training data to make good-enough predictions. This barrier can be high. Take the case of radiology, where a prediction machine needs to be measurably better than highly skilled humans in order to be trusted with people’s lives. That suggests that the first company to build a generally applicable AI for radiology (one that can read any scanned image) will have little competition at first because so much data is needed for success. But the initial advantage may be short-lived if the market is growing rapidly, because in a fast-growing market the payoff from having access to the training data will probably be large enough to attract multiple big companies with deep pockets. This, of course, means that training-data entry requirements are subject to the economics of scale, like so much else. High-growth markets attract investments, and over time this raises the threshold for the next new entrant (and forces everyone already in the sector to spend more on developing or marketing their products). Thus the more data you can train your machines on, the bigger the hurdle for anyone coming after you, which brings us to the second question. Prediction machines exploit what has traditionally been the human advantage—they learn. If they can incorporate feedback data, then they can learn from outcomes and improve the quality of the next prediction. The extent of this advantage, however, depends on the time it takes to get feedback. With a radiology scan, if an autopsy is required to assess whether a machine-learning algorithm correctly predicted cancer, then feedback will be slow, and although a company may have an early lead in collecting and reading scans, it will be limited in its ability to learn and thus sustain its lead. By contrast, if feedback data can be generated quickly after obtaining the prediction, then an early lead will translate into a sustained competitive advantage, because the minimum efficient scale will soon be out of the reach of even the biggest companies. When Microsoft launched the Bing search engine in 2009, it had the company’s full backing. Microsoft invested billions of dollars in it. Yet more than a decade later, Bing’s market share remains far below Google’s, in both search volume and search advertising revenue. One reason Bing found it hard to catch up was the feedback loop. In search, the time between the prediction (offering up a page with several suggested links in response to a query) and the feedback (the user’s clicking on one of the links) is short—usually seconds. In other words, the feedback loop is fast and powerful. Peter Greenwood By the time Bing entered the market, Google had already been operating an AI-based search engine for a decade or more, helping millions of users and performing billions of searches daily. Every time a user made a query, Google provided its prediction of the most relevant links, and then the user selected the best of those links, enabling Google to update its prediction model. That allowed for constant learning in light of a constantly expanding search space. With so much training data based on so many users, Google could identify new events and new trends more quickly than Bing could. In the end, the fast feedback loop, combined with other factors—Google’s continued investment in massive data-processing facilities, and the real or perceived costs to customers of switching to another engine—meant that Bing always lagged. Other search engines that tried to compete with Google and Bing never even got started. The success of any product ultimately depends on what you get for what you pay. If consumers are offered two similar products at the same price, they will generally choose the one they perceive to be of higher quality. Prediction quality, as we’ve already noted, is often easy to assess. In radiology, search, advertising, and many other contexts, companies can design AIs with a clear, single metric for quality: accuracy. As in other industries, the highest-quality products benefit from higher demand. AI-based products are different from others, however, because for most other products, better quality costs more, and sellers of inferior goods survive by using cheaper materials or less-expensive manufacturing processes and then charging lower prices. This strategy isn’t as feasible in the context of AI. Because AI is software-based, a low-quality prediction is as expensive to produce as a high-quality one, making discount pricing unrealistic. And if the better prediction is priced the same as the worse one, there is no reason to purchase the lower-quality one. For Google, this is another factor explaining why its lead in search may be unassailable. Competitors’ predictions often look pretty similar to Google’s. Enter the word “weather” into Google or Bing, and the results will be much the same—forecasts will pop up first. But if you enter a less common term, differences may emerge. If you type in, say, “disruption,” Bing’s first page will usually show dictionary definitions, while Google provides both definitions and links to research papers on the topic of disruptive innovation. Although Bing can perform as well as Google for some text queries, for others it’s less accurate in predicting what consumers are looking for. And there are few if any other search categories where Bing is widely seen as superior. The bottom line is that in AI, an early mover can build a scale-based competitive advantage if feedback loops are fast and performance quality is clear. So what does this mean for late movers? Buried in the three questions are clues to two ways in which a late entrant can carve out its own space in the market. Would-be contenders needn’t choose between these approaches; they can try both. In some markets for prediction tools, there may be reservoirs of potential training data that incumbents have not already captured. Going back to the example of radiology, tens of thousands of doctors are each reading thousands of scans a year, meaning that hundreds of millions (or even billions) of new data points are available. Early entrants will have training data from a few hundred radiologists. Of course, once their software is running in the field, the number of scans and the amount of feedback in their database will increase substantially, but the billions of scans previously analyzed and verified represent an opportunity for laggards to catch up, assuming they are able to pool the scans and analyze them in the aggregate. If that’s the case, they might be able to develop an AI that makes good-enough predictions to go to market, after which they too can benefit from feedback. Latecomers could also consider training an AI using pathology or autopsy data rather than human diagnoses. That strategy would enable them to reach the quality threshold sooner (because biopsies and autopsies are more definitive than body scans), though the subsequent feedback loop would be slower. Alternatively, instead of trying to find untapped sources of training data, latecomers could look for new sources of feedback data that enable faster learning than what incumbents are using. (BenchSci is an example of a company that has succeeded in doing this.) By being first with a novel supply of faster feedback data, the newcomer can then learn from the actions and choices of its users to make its product better. But in markets where feedback loops are already fairly rapid and where incumbents are operating at scale, the opportunities for pulling off this approach will be relatively limited. And significantly faster feedback would likely trigger a disruption of current practices, meaning that the new entrants would not really be competing with established companies but instead displacing them. Another tactic that can help late entrants become competitive is to redefine what makes a prediction “better,” even if only for some customers. In radiology, for example, such a strategy could be possible if there is market demand for different types of predictions. Early entrants most likely trained their algorithms with data from one hospital system, one type of hardware, or one country. By using training data (and then feedback data) from another system or another country, the newcomer could customize its AI for that user segment if it is sufficiently distinct. If, say, urban Americans and people in rural China tend to experience different health conditions, then a prediction machine built to diagnose one of those groups might not be as accurate for diagnosing patients in the other group. Latecomers could look for new sources of feedback data that enable faster learning. Creating predictions that rely on data coming from a particular type of hardware could also provide a market opportunity, if that business model results in lower costs or increases accessibility for customers. Many of today’s AIs for radiology draw upon data from the most widely used X-ray machines, scanners, and ultrasound devices made by GE, Siemens, and other established manufacturers. However, if the algorithms are applied to data from other machines, the resulting predictions may be less accurate. Thus a late entrant could find a niche by offering a product tailored to that other equipment—which might be attractive for medical facilities to use if it is cheaper to purchase or operate or is specialized to meet the needs of particular customers.  The potential of prediction machines is immense, and there is no doubt that the tech giants have a head start. But it’s worth remembering that predictions are like precisely engineered products, highly adapted for specific purposes and contexts. If you can differentiate the purposes and contexts even a little, you can create a defensible space for your own product. Although the devil is in the details of how you collect and use data, your salvation rests there as well. Nonetheless, the real key to competing successfully with Big Tech in industries powered by intelligent machines lies in a question that only a human can answer: What is it that you want to predict? Of course, figuring out the answer is not easy. Doing so necessitates a deep understanding of market dynamics and thoughtful analysis of the potential worth of specific predictions and the products and services in which they are embedded. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the lead investor in BenchSci’s Series A2 financing was not one of the many local Canadian tech investors but rather an AI-focused venture capital firm called Gradient Ventures—owned by Google."
"101",101,"https://hbr.org/2020/08/data-privacy-rules-are-changing-how-can-marketers-keep-up","marketing.txt","Earlier this year, the state of California announced that there would be no pandemic-related delay in enforcing the CCPA data privacy act. Many businesses — especially those who had a limited digital presence before the pandemic — have struggled to adapt to these stringent new regulations while transforming their businesses to work in the new normal. But with analytics and automation technologies, companies can make great strides in their data protection infrastructure, helping them to meet both regulatory requirements and consumer expectations. As the pandemic forces companies all around the world to shift to remote work and digital systems, renewed attention has been drawn to questions around data privacy. After all, consumers might be willing to accept a delayed package, a canceled flight, or an extended service window in light of the pandemic — but compromise their personal data, and it is game over. What can marketers do to meet rising consumer expectations (not to mention regulatory requirements) regarding data privacy? This conversation isn’t new. A recent study found that 84% of customers will abandon an online purchase if the website isn’t secure. Back in 2018, the EU passed the landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to increase data privacy requirements, and earlier this year, California announced there would be no pandemic-related delay in enforcing the newly-passed “California Consumer Privacy Act” (CCPA). These regulations give consumers more awareness and control over exactly what personal information is collected, how it is sold, and how its security is ensured. Marketers have taken a variety of steps to comply with the new regulations, such as making sure web forms include opt-in checkboxes that ask for consent before adding users to a mailing list, providing easy access to privacy statements and disclosures, and creating dedicated web pages where users can submit requests to access, modify, or delete their personal information. However, while both B2B and B2C marketers have taken extra care for some time to ensure prospects have consented to being targeted, the current climate has made it much more challenging to maintain adequate protections. The pandemic has forced countless non-digital businesses to shift to online operations overnight, and many of these companies didn’t have remote work policies and procedures in place for managing sensitive data outside the office. When combined with the onslaught of new regulations like the CCPA, these businesses have understandably struggled to protect consumer data as reliably as they used to. But with agile, adaptable tools, marketers can capitalize on this shift to online operations to build consumer trust and demonstrate dedication to data privacy. Specifically, analytics and automation technologies can help companies meet new legislative requirements around customer and auditor requests much more efficiently and affordably. The CCPA specifies “rights of access” requirements, which means that customers must have a way to ask for a copy of the data categories being gathered, or for their data to be deleted. To comply with these requests quickly and reliably, businesses need digital, do-it-yourself solutions for automating mission-critical tasks like data deletion and extraction. For example, forms that auto-populate with necessary information can help ensure that complicated requirements are met. Similarly, real-time desktop guidance tools or virtual assistants can help employees execute tasks in a specific order, or prompt contact center agents to provide and confirm proper disclosure information. In addition, analytics tools can provide insights that significantly reduce the potential for human error in complying with complex, global data protection regulations. These tools can be used to identify customer interactions with higher compliance risk and automatically queue them into a predefined auditing workflow. For interactions where customer data is being collected, for instance, these tools can determine whether the proper CCPA or GDPR disclosure has taken place, and then automatically prompt agents in real time to share the required disclosure information and maintain compliance. This reduces the need for manual call listening, freeing up quality monitors and supervisors to be more responsive to complex inquiries. Analytics tools also make it possible to build queries that identify all interactions that mention key words such as “CCPA,” “personal information,” “remove,” or “disclose.” With these queries, marketers can better understand the volume of traffic pertaining to the CCPA, which can be useful for trending and reporting. In addition, interactions that mention data removal could be automatically funneled into a quality monitoring workflow, enabling reviewers to easily verify that the information requested for removal was indeed removed from the company’s database. As the pandemic pushes companies to conduct more of their business online, the data privacy conversation launched by regulations such as GDPR and CCPA has taken on new urgency all around the world. To maintain compliance — as well as consumer trust — companies must invest in automation and analytics tools that safeguard customer privacy. It is only by investing in solutions that are agile, adaptable, and capable of keeping pace with evolving regulations that organizations will be able to thrive in the new era of consumer data protection."
"102",102,"https://hbr.org/2020/08/dont-cut-your-marketing-budget-in-a-recession","marketing.txt","Companies tend to cut marketing in a recession.  But firms that maintain their marketing spend while reallocating it to suit the context – be it in product developing, advertising and communication, or pricing – typically fare better than firms that cut their marketing investment. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Most companies reduce spending in recessions, especially on marketing items that may be easier to cut (certainly relative to payroll). Right now, advertising agencies are struggling to stay afloat, and Google and Facebook are reporting substantially lower ad revenues as marketing spending dives with the business cycle (cyclical marketing). But that is today’s equivalent of bleeding – an old-fashioned but once widespread treatment that actually reduces the patient’s ability to fight disease. Companies that have bounced back most strongly from previous recessions usually did not cut their marketing spend, and in many cases actually increased it. But they did change what they were spending their marketing budget on and when to reflect the new context in which they operated. Let’s begin by taking a look at the various categories of marketing costs. New product launches are risky even in boom times, and there is always considerable debate within any firm about which of the many new products under development should actually go to market. In this context, axing new product development projects in a recession looks like a no-brainer. But research in contexts as different as U.K. fast-moving consumer goods and U.S. automobile markets shows that products launched during a recession have both higher long-term survival chances and higher sales revenues. That’s partly because there are fewer new products to compete with, but it also comes from the fact that companies maintaining R&D have focused the investment on their best prospects — which may explain why products introduced during recessions have been shown to be of higher quality. Timing, of course, is important: Our research shows that the best period to launch a new product is just after a recession’s mid-point. This is when consumers start to think about non-necessities, even expensive products they don’t want to buy yet (such as cars). A new and innovative product engenders hope that the economy is on the mend, and that the consumer may soon be able to afford it. Even if they don’t have new products ready to bring to market at the right time, smart firms continue to invest in R&D during recessions, which has been shown to have a stronger impact over long-term performance than other categories of marketing spend, such as advertising and price promotion. This is because maintaining R&D means that companies emerge from the recession with a relatively stronger pipeline, particularly in cyclical industries such as automobiles, cement, and steel. Faced with declining sales volume, managers are tempted to increase prices in the hope of maintaining revenues and margins. It’s not hard to see why this is a bad idea: As recessions make consumers more price sensitive, any increase in price will further reduce the likelihood of making a sale, which is why firms that have raised prices soon turn to price promotions to reverse the effect.  But the research shows that this see-sawing on price backfires: Firms that engage in it lose more market share than those that don’t. During recessions, when most firms are cutting back on their brand advertising, a firm’s share of voice increases if it can maintain or increase its advertising budget. Take the case of Reckitt Benckiser: In the recession following the 2008 financial crash, the company launched a marketing campaign aimed at persuading its consumers to continue purchasing its more expensive and better performing brands, despite the harsh economic climate. Increasing its advertising outlays by 25% in the face of reduced marketing by competitors, Reckitt Benckiser actually grew revenues by 8% and profits by 14%, when most of its rivals were reporting profit declines of 10% or more. They viewed advertising as an investment rather than an expense. The content of advertising during recessions must reflect the challenges that consumers are encountering. Consumers in a downturn want to see brands show solidarity. Successful brand advertising during a recession not only injects humor and emotion, but also answers for consumers the question: How can we help? Take the case of Coca-Cola.  In 2020, the company used its advertising budget to showcase the work of frontline workers, creating mini stories about unsung heroes. The Coca Cola brand features subtly in the background of these messages, reminding consumers that Coca Cola always has been, and always will be there for you, in good times and bad. A similar tactic allowed Singapore Airlines to demonstrate how its grounded crew was redeployed to helping the community deal with the outbreak. Cabin crew used their skills as care ambassadors. Some helped nurses by taking patients’ vital signs, noting meal orders and serving them. Others worked at transport hubs assisting with crowd control and ensuring compliance with safe distancing guidelines. We all know that a company’s existing branding and size are major factors in how well placed it is to weather and even benefit from a recession. Strong brands are often better able to maintain prices in a recession.  At the same time, large companies and smart negotiators can often get price concessions from suppliers in a recession. But how a company’s positioning and capability play out — and what needs to change — will depend on the dynamics of the industry and country in question, which means that companies operating in multiple markets need to choose different strategies for different parts of the business. Take the case of a one large Russian conglomerate that we advised during and after the 2008 global financial crisis. It operates in six countries and six industries, ranging from mainstream apparel to specialized banking. For its mainstream apparel brand in Russia, the company maintained its advertising budget, while other (mostly foreign) brands simply cut the quantity of messaging and did little to change the content of what they did release.  This worked out well for the company because its existing positioning as a local, value-for-money brand appealed to consumers at a time when spending on foreign luxuries felt and looked bad. As the recession receded, many new customers, who had switched from more expensive foreign clothing, stayed with the local brand. The conglomerate applied a very different approach to its banking operation in Romania. Unlike most of its competitors, our client expected a deep recession and a slow recovery. In this scenario the prospects for getting in new business were poor, and so the company slashed its previously large retail advertising budget and closed a large number of retail branches. This freed up resources so that it could better support existing customers. All customer acquisition efforts, meanwhile, were focused on high net-worth individuals.  Its focus on helping existing customers and its careful targeting of new customers helped the bank to grow in the post-recession recovery period. Marketing in a recession will never be easy, largely because it often involves going against instincts and standard operating norms. Customers’ behavior undergoes profound changes – reflecting changes in their circumstances and needs, which may even be traumatic. In this environment you must accompany your customers on their new, different journey, shifting your message and even re-engineering your value proposition. This is a time not to stop spending money but a time to change how you spend it. It is also an opportunity, because firms who are willing to be what customers need in a recession get to keep many of the new customers they get — and cement the loyalty of those they already had.

The authors suggest a 4-part framework to help businesses better understand how different types of brand actions are likely to be perceived, based on whether the action is corporation-oriented or societally-oriented, as well as whether the action is undertaken more passively as an ally, or more proactively as an activist. Ultimately, the authors argue that the most authentic brand actions are those that proactively advocate societally-oriented, anti-racist actions despite potential risk to the corporation. “In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” -Angela Davis, American political activist, academic, author Recent protests demanding social justice and the affirmation of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement have provoked a flurry of activity among corporations as they drop brands that have racist connotations, reposition other brands with ambiguous to outright offensive racial implications, explicitly state their solidarity with the movement, and donate money to racial justice causes. But do consumers perceive these actions as authentic — especially when many of these companies are not Black owned and/or have a lackluster history of Black corporate leadership? And will these strategies result in long-term brand loyalty? The literature defines brand authenticity as the extent to which consumers perceive a brand to be faithful to itself (continuity), faithful to its customers’ expectations for the brand to deliver on its promises (credibility), motivated by caring and responsibility towards the community (integrity), and reflecting values that consumers consider important (symbolism). Continuity and credibility are focused solely on the company and its customers, so these actions can be said to have a corporate orientation. Integrity and symbolism, on the other hand, are more focused on social issues outside the immediate scope of the company, and so these actions can be said to have a societal orientation. While both orientations are important and valid ways of expressing a brand’s authenticity, actions with a societal orientation are likely to be perceived as more authentic when it comes to social issues such as racial justice. In addition to orientation, brands can also choose to participate in these actions more actively or more passively. Specifically, they can choose to play a supportive non-racist role as an ally, indicating support for change with limited action, or they can choose to be an activist proactively involved in anti-racist actions and campaigns. As marketing professors who have studied consumer relationships with brands, we present a framework to help companies understand how authentic their brand actions will appear to consumers. By examining the intersection of orientation (corporate or societal) and type of participation (ally or activist) as presented in the table below, several brand actions of varied levels of authenticity emerge. Atone: To make amends for past wrongdoings. These are corporation-oriented actions that companies take as allies. Essentially the bare minimum, these actions show that the corporation is at least aware of the need to act given past brand decisions that fly in the face of social justice. For example, if a company has products with negative racial connotations, such as Quaker Oats’ brand Aunt Jemima, it can choose to discontinue the brand. However, atoning for past sins with a mere withdrawal or a repackaging of a product, while important, is both fairly passive and self-focused, and as such, consumers likely to view these actions as low in authenticity. Allure: To proactively attract consumers. These are actions that are still corporation-oriented, but are more proactive than mere atonements: A corporation can be an activist and support a cause in a way that’s also directly in their self-interest. For example, Aerosoles announced it would support racial justice and combat discrimination by donating 10% of sales proceeds to the NAACP. This is a proactive approach to supporting an important social issue, but it is still self-serving, since it will also bring in more revenue as consumers seek to support the cause through their purchases. As such, consumers are likely to view these sorts of actions as low-medium in authenticity. (Note that this is different from another popular strategy in which brands donate 100% of their profits or a fixed dollar amount. In these cases, corporations do not benefit as directly from increased sales, so we would rate this strategy medium-high in perceived authenticity.) Acknowledge: To recognize a broad social issue. These actions are relatively passive, but they acknowledge social issues in a wider context than limited, corporation-oriented actions. As allies, corporations take societally-oriented actions in support of racial justice that might not lead them to profit directly, but are also unlikely to have a negative impact on the business. Netflix’s curation of BLM content, for example, is an action that supports a social mission and aligns with their business model, but is unlikely to drive significant new revenue. As such, consumers are likely to view the authenticity of this brand action as medium-high. Advocate: To actively support a cause or policy. To quote Ibram Kendi, author of How To Be An Antiracist, “To be anti-racist is a radical choice in the face of history, requiring a radical reorientation of our consciousness.” To advocate for important social issues in a manner that will feel truly authentic to consumers, corporations must take an active, societally-oriented approach — one that may have even a potentially harmful impact on business goals. Nike is a great example of a company that took a stand without obvious self-interest: When Colin Kaepernick was abandoned by the NFL after kneeling during the national anthem, Nike made the risky decision to use him as the face of their Just Do It campaign. Despite widespread backlash, the company did end up seeing a surge in sales. Because of the corporate risk and the implications for broad racial justice, this campaign exemplifies a high-authenticity action.  Today’s consumers are vocal about social issues, and they are quick to take disingenuous corporations to task. A majority of Americans of all generations — 60% of the U.S. population — say that how a brand responds to racial justice protests will influence whether they buy or boycott the brand in the future. Additionally, 60% say brands should take steps to address the root causes of racial inequity and 57% say brands must educate the public. And Millennial and Gen Z consumers have expectations of brand authenticity that far exceed those of generations before them. These adult consumers are the most racially and ethnically diverse in American history, and they want corporations to stand for something beyond traditional consumer benefits and product quality.  A June 2020 survey found that 69% of Millennial and Gen Z consumers think brands should be actively involved in the BLM movement. To connect with these younger consumers, brands need to take a stand against racial injustice in a way that is authentic to the corporation as well as their customers. Armed with this framework for brand actions outlined in this article, corporations can strategically assess the level of authenticity of different actions, enabling them both to better understand the impact of past actions and to better gauge how future planned actions are likely to be perceived. For brands that want to build a reputation as role models with a significant societal impact, the way forward is clear: The most authentic brand actions are ones that proactively advocate societally-oriented, anti-racist actions. These are actions that come with some risk, but they are also most likely to be rewarded with real consumer loyalty."
"104",104,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/retailers-face-a-data-deficit-in-the-wake-of-the-pandemic","marketing.txt","The change in consumer behavior caused by Covid-19 has created an unexpected problem: an information deficit, as data from before the crisis can’t effectively predict new trends. In other words, the essential ingredient for retail customer loyalty programs, AI-driven product recommendations, and a wide array of critical business decisions now has a quality issue. Retailers can deal with this problem by taking five steps: 1) Stand up new channels for data collection and communication, 2) leverage “Covid-19-aware” data sources that are capturing consumer behavior indicators at present, 3) revisit revenue projections to account for the new constraints imposed on shopping due to Covid-19, 4) use spatial analysis in conjunction with relevant Covid-19 health ordinances and regulations to analyze where it makes the most sense to focus attention upon reopening, and 5) take this opportunity to give attention to the infrastructure supporting key data assets. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. When stay-at-home orders took hold this past March, retail sales dropped dramatically — as everybody knows. But that change in customer behavior has resulted in a phenomenon that hasn’t been talked about much: the flow of sales information to retailers’ data repositories has dried up. That’s a significant problem, because a healthy flow of that information is the lifeblood of customer loyalty programs, AI-driven product recommendations, and a wide array of critical business decisions. What this change means is that many retailers – independent or chain, brick-and-mortar or e-commerce, startup or legacy – are now facing an information deficit. That’s what happens when the data and intelligence derived from customer transactions becomes scarce or unusable due to a sudden change in buyer behavior. Today the problem is widespread: Even businesses that had amassed great volumes of customer data before Covid-19 are finding themselves in the same cold-start position as businesses venturing into unknown markets or reaching out to new audiences. The effects of this disruption could be massive in the mid- to long term, because it obviously makes customer behavior more challenging to interpret, to predict, and to pattern. In the current context, this much is clear: Businesses should not take for granted that the data they gathered before Covid-19 will accurately predict buyer behavior in the socially distant economy. Instead, retailers must take careful stock of the data inputs and analytical assumptions that now drive their products and business decision-making. They must identify the risks of carrying on with the status quo, and they must respond to the challenges of the moment with creativity and innovation. This recalibration exercise will help retailers quickly figure out how to stay relevant as American consumers change. In our post-stay-at-home reality, companies need to recognize that their existing predictive models, forecasts, and dashboards may all be unreliable, or even obsolete, and that their analytic tools need recalibrating. Although the objectives of a specific automated system or predictive model may not have changed, the input data and the users certainly have, which should cause companies to re-evaluate how outputs are interpreted and relied upon. Companies also need to avoid making shortsighted decisions about data infrastructure and human resources. Although staff reductions can help to offset immediate profit loss, eliminating the people who know how to organize, clean, mine, and model customer data can create intractable technical debt. When making resource decisions, leaders must truly understand which systems will suffer as a result of losing a specific role, then quantify and weigh the longer-term cost of any fallout. The changes we’ve recently witnessed in customer behavior have left some companies feeling as though they’ve been dropped in the middle of the woods without a compass. The classic “Who is our customer?” question has suddenly become harder than ever to answer. Are current online shoppers repeat customers who migrated from brick-and-mortar stores, or are they net new customers? Retail businesses have always had a blind spot in this area, but until now they haven’t had much reason to prioritize it. Those who make the most of the current stay-at-home moment to gain clarity here could make transformative discoveries that will serve them well beyond 2020. Which brings us to some good news: This situation represents an opportunity for companies that have not ever fully harnessed data to make evidence-based business decisions. Before the pandemic struck, these companies lagged behind data-mature companies, but as data-mature companies are now struggling to contend with a sudden information deficit, the less data-mature companies have a one-time opportunity to build their data-gathering capabilities and enhance their data-driven decision-making. For a brief period, at least, they’ve got a chance to catch up. In this moment, it’s important for all companies, no matter how data-mature, to remember that “customer data” is not limited to point-of-sale transactions. Retailers should consider data to be any information that is relevant to their customers’ behavior that can be ethically collected, organized, and studied for insights that decision-makers can rely on. As restrictions on public life continue to ease and shopping resumes, retailers must get creative about where and how to collect this information. They should, for example, broaden their understanding of shopper behavior to include anything that signals the way a customer relates to a company and its products. There’s lots more companies should do: They should study which messages resonate with different customer segments. They should measure their expectations for fulfillment. They should characterize the nuanced ways customers’ purchasing patterns have been transformed. Companies must not let a temporary reduction in transactions or three months of distorted data impact their ability to make informed decisions. Using the analytical methods of data science, they have to weave many threads together to fashion business resilience in the face of uncertainty. To defend against an information deficit, it’s essential to understand what relevant data are available and how those data can be reengineered to answer contemporary questions. Companies can examine their own existing data within a smaller timeframe or even design a survey to get a fresh pulse on customers’ needs and plans. Moreover, refreshing machine-learning models and analytic tools will help companies get back on track and begin competing anew. Here are some ideas available to retailers to get in front of the information deficit problem. Covid-19 will eventually fade away, but that does not mean business decision-making should resume its prior incarnation. Data and quality analysis will remain essential instruments for making wise decisions about customers. Retailers that can harness data quickly and smartly will maintain their business and a competitive advantage in the long run.

"105",105,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/a-better-way-to-onboard-ai","marketing.txt","In a 2018 Workforce Institute survey of 3,000 managers across eight industrialized nations, the majority of respondents described artificial intelligence as a valuable productivity tool. But respondents to that survey also expressed fears that AI would take their jobs. They are not alone. The Guardian recently reported that in the UK “more than 6 million workers fear being replaced by machines.” AI’s advantages can be cast in a dark light: Why would humans be needed when machines can do a better job? To allay such fears, employers must set AI up to succeed rather than to fail. The authors draw on their own and others’ research and consulting on AI and information systems implementation, along with organizational studies of innovation and work practices, to present a four-phase approach to implementing AI. It allows organizations to cultivate people’s trust—a key condition for adoption—and to work toward a distributed cognitive system in which humans and artificial intelligence both continually improve. Many companies struggle to apply AI and fail to achieve the productivity improvements they seek. Executives often don’t make clear that they are using AI to help people increase productivity rather than to replace them. Treat AI adoption as an onboarding process that consists of four phases: AI as an assistant, as a monitor, as a coach, and as a teammate. In a 2018 Workforce Institute survey of  3,000 managers across eight industrialized nations, the majority of respondents described artificial intelligence as a valuable productivity tool.   It’s easy to see why: AI brings tangible benefits in processing speed, accuracy, and consistency (machines don’t make mistakes because they’re tired), which is why many professionals now rely on it. Some medical specialists, for example, use AI tools to help make diagnoses and decisions about treatment. But respondents to that survey also expressed fears that AI would take their jobs. They are not alone. The Guardian recently reported that more than 6 million workers in the UK fear being replaced by machines. These fears are echoed by academics and executives we meet at conferences and seminars. AI’s advantages can be cast in a much darker light: Why would humans be needed when machines can do a better job? The prevalence of such fears suggests that organizations looking to reap the benefits of AI need to be careful when introducing it to the people expected to work with it. Andrew Wilson, until January 2020 Accenture’s CIO, says, “The greater the degree of organizational focus on people helping AI, and AI helping people, the greater the value achieved.” Accenture has found that when companies make it clear that they are using AI to help people rather than to replace them, they significantly outperform companies that don’t set that objective (or are unclear about their AI goals) along most dimensions of managerial productivity—notably speed, scalability, and effectiveness of decision-making. In other words, just as when new talent joins a team, AI must be set up to succeed rather than to fail. A smart employer trains new hires by giving them simple tasks that build hands-on experience in a noncritical context and assigns them mentors to offer help and advice. This allows the newcomers to learn while others focus on higher-value tasks. As they gain experience and demonstrate that they can do the job, their mentors increasingly rely on them as sounding boards and entrust them with more-substantive decisions. Over time an apprentice becomes a partner, contributing skills and insight. Jean-Baptiste Perrot We believe this approach can work for artificial intelligence as well. In the following pages we draw on our own and others’ research and consulting on AI and information systems implementation, along with organizational studies of innovation and work practices, to present a four-phase approach to implementing AI. It allows enterprises to cultivate people’s trust—a key condition for adoption—and to work toward a distributed human-AI cognitive system in which people and AI both continually improve. Many organizations have experimented with phase 1, and some have progressed to phases 2 and 3. For now, phase 4 may be mostly a “future-casting” exercise of which we see some early signs, but it is feasible from a technological perspective and would provide more value to companies as they engage with artificial intelligence. This first phase of onboarding artificial intelligence is rather like the process of training an assistant. You teach the new employee a few fundamental rules and hand over some basic but time-consuming tasks you normally do (such as filing online forms or summarizing documents), which frees you to focus on more-important aspects of the job. The trainee learns by watching you, performing the tasks, and asking questions. One common task for AI assistants is sorting data. An example is the recommendation systems companies have used since the mid-1990s to help customers filter thousands of products and find the ones most relevant to them—Amazon and Netflix being among the leaders in this technology. More and more business decisions now require this type of data sorting. When, for example, portfolio managers are choosing stocks in which to invest, the information available is far more than a human can feasibly process, and new information comes out all the time, adding to the historical record. Software can make the task more manageable by immediately filtering stocks to meet predefined investment criteria. Natural-language processing, meanwhile, can identify the news most relevant to a company and even assess the general sentiment about an upcoming corporate event as reflected in analysts’ reports. Marble Bar Asset Management (MBAM), a London-based investment firm founded in 2002, is an early convert to using such technologies in the workplace. It has developed a state-of-the-art platform, called RAID (Research Analysis & Information Database), to help portfolio managers filter through high volumes of information about corporate events, news developments, and stock movements. AI is very helpful during high-volume decision-making, when humans may be tired. Another way AI can lend assistance is to model what a human might do. As anyone who uses Google will have noticed, prompts appear as a search phrase is typed in. Predictive text on a smartphone offers a similar way to speed up the process of typing. This kind of user modeling, related to what is sometimes called judgmental bootstrapping, was developed more than 30 years ago; it can easily be applied to decision-making. AI would use it to identify the choice an employee is most likely to make, given that employee’s past choices, and would suggest that choice as a starting point when the employee is faced with multiple decisions—speeding up, rather than actually doing, the job. Let’s look at this in a specific context. When airline employees are deciding how much food and drink to put on a given flight, they fill out catering orders, which involve a certain amount of calculation together with assumptions based on their experience of previous flights. Making the wrong choices incurs costs: Underordering risks upsetting customers who may avoid future travel on the airline. Overordering means the excess food will go to waste and the plane will have increased its fuel consumption unnecessarily. An algorithm can be very helpful in this context. AI can predict what the airline’s catering manager would order by analyzing his or her past choices or using rules set by the manager. This “autocomplete” of “recommended orders” can be customized for every flight using all relevant historical data, including food and drink consumption on the route in question and even past purchasing behavior by passengers on the manifest for that flight. But as with predictive typing, human users can freely overwrite as needed; they are always in the driver’s seat. AI simply assists them by imitating or anticipating their decision style. It should not be a stretch for managers to work with AI in this way. We already do so in our personal lives, when we allow the autocomplete function to prefill forms for us online. In the workplace a manager can, for example, define specific rules for an AI assistant to follow when completing forms. In fact, many software tools currently used in the workplace (such as credit-rating programs) are already just that: collections of human-defined decision rules. The AI assistant can refine the rules by codifying the circumstances under which the manager actually follows them. This learning needn’t involve any change in the manager’s behavior, let alone any effort to “teach” the assistant. The next step is to set up the AI system to provide real-time feedback. Thanks to machine-learning programs, AI can be trained to accurately forecast what a user’s decision would be in a given situation (absent lapses in rationality owing to, for example, overconfidence or fatigue). If a user is about to make a choice that is inconsistent with his or her choice history, the system can flag the discrepancy. This is especially helpful during high-volume decision-making, when human employees may be tired or distracted. Research in psychology, behavioral economics, and cognitive science shows that humans have limited and imperfect reasoning capabilities, especially when it comes to statistical and probabilistic problems, which are ubiquitous in business. Several studies (of which one of us, Chen, is a coauthor) concerning legal decisions found that judges grant political asylum more frequently before lunch than after, that they give lighter prison sentences if their NFL team won the previous day than if it lost, and that they will go easier on a defendant on the latter’s birthday. Clearly justice might be better served if human decision makers were assisted by software that told them when a decision they were planning to make was inconsistent with their prior decisions or with the decision that an analysis of purely legal variables would predict. AI can deliver that kind of input. Another study (also with Chen as a coauthor) showed that AI programs processing a model made up of basic legal variables (constructed by the study’s authors) can predict asylum decisions with roughly 80% accuracy on the date a case opens. The authors have added learning functionality to the program, which enables it to simulate the decision-making of an individual judge by drawing on that judge’s past decisions. The approach translates well to other contexts. For example, when portfolio managers (PMs) at Marble Bar Asset Management consider buy or sell decisions that may raise the overall portfolio risk—for example, by increasing exposure to a particular sector or geography—the system alerts them through a pop-up during a computerized transaction process so that they can adjust appropriately. A PM may ignore such feedback as long as company risk limits are observed. But in any case the feedback helps the PM reflect on his or her decisions. Of course AI is not always “right.” Often its suggestions don’t take into account some reliable private information to which the human decision maker has access, so the AI might steer an employee off course rather than simply correct for possible behavioral biases. That’s why using it should be like a dialogue, in which the algorithm provides nudges according to the data it has while the human teaches the AI by explaining why he or she overrode a particular nudge. This improves the AI’s usefulness and preserves the autonomy of the human decision maker. Unfortunately, many AI systems are set up to usurp that autonomy. Once an algorithm has flagged a bank transaction as possibly fraudulent, for example, employees are often unable to approve the transaction without clearing it with a supervisor or even an outside auditor. Sometimes undoing a machine’s choice is next to impossible—a persistent source of frustration for both customers and customer service professionals. In many cases the rationale for an AI choice is opaque, and employees are in no position to question that choice even when mistakes have been made. Of course AI is not always “right.” That’s why using it should be like a dialogue. Privacy is another big issue when machines collect data on the decisions people make. In addition to giving humans control in their exchanges with AI, we need to guarantee that any data it collects on them is kept confidential. A wall ought to separate the engineering team from management; otherwise employees may worry that if they freely interact with the system and make mistakes, they might later suffer for them. Also, companies should set rules about designing and interacting with AI to ensure organizational consistency in norms and practices. These rules might specify the level of predictive accuracy required to show a nudge or to offer a reason for one; criteria for the necessity of a nudge; and the conditions under which an employee should either follow the AI’s instruction or refer it to a superior rather than accept or reject it. To help employees retain their sense of control in phase 2, we advise managers and systems designers to involve them in design: Engage them as experts to define the data that will be used and to determine ground truth; familiarize them with models during development; and provide training and interaction as those models are deployed. In the process, employees will see how the models are built, how the data is managed, and why the machines make the recommendations they do. In a recent PwC survey nearly 60% of respondents said that they would like to get performance feedback on a daily or a weekly basis. It’s not hard to see why. As Peter Drucker asserted in his famous 2005 Harvard Business Review article “Managing Oneself,” people generally don’t know what they are good at. And when they think they do know, they are usually wrong. The trouble is that the only way to discover strengths and opportunities for improvement is through a careful analysis of key decisions and actions. That requires documenting expectations about outcomes and then, nine months to a year later, comparing those expectations with what actually happened. Thus the feedback employees get usually comes from hierarchical superiors during a review—not at a time or in a format of the recipient’s choosing. That is unfortunate, because, as Tessa West of New York University found in a recent neuroscience study, the more people feel that their autonomy is protected and that they are in control of the conversation—able to choose, for example, when feedback is given—the better they respond to it. AI could address this problem. The capabilities we’ve already mentioned could easily generate feedback for employees, enabling them to look at their own performance and reflect on variations and errors. A monthly summary analyzing data drawn from their past behavior might help them better understand their decision patterns and practices. A few companies, notably in the financial sector, are taking this approach. Portfolio managers at MBAM, for example, receive feedback from a data analytics system that captures investment decisions at the individual level. Jean-Baptiste Perrot The data can reveal interesting and varying biases among PMs. Some may be more loss-averse than others, holding on to underperforming investments longer than they should. Others may be overconfident, possibly taking on too large a position in a given investment. The analysis identifies these behaviors and—like a coach—provides personalized feedback that highlights behavioral changes over time, suggesting how to improve decisions. But it is up to the PMs to decide how to incorporate the feedback. MBAM’s leadership believes this “trading enhancement” is becoming a core differentiator that both helps develop portfolio managers and makes the organization more attractive. What’s more, just as a good mentor learns from the insights of the people who are being mentored, a machine-learning “coachbot” learns from the decisions of an empowered human employee. In the relationship we’ve described, a human can disagree with the coachbot—and that creates new data that will change the AI’s implicit model. For example, if a portfolio manager decides not to trade a highlighted stock because of recent company events, he or she can provide an explanation to the system. With feedback, the system continually captures data that can be analyzed to provide insights. If employees can relate to and control exchanges with artificial intelligence, they are more likely to see it as a safe channel for feedback that aims to help rather than to assess performance. Choosing the right interface is useful to this end. At MBAM, for example, trading enhancement tools—visuals, for instance—are personalized to reflect a PM’s preferences. As in phase 2, involving employees in designing the system is essential. When AI is a coach, people will be even more fearful of disempowerment. It can easily seem like a competitor as well as a partner—and who wants to feel less intelligent than a machine? Concerns about autonomy and privacy may be even stronger. Working with a coach requires honesty, and people may hesitate to be open with one that might share unflattering data with the folks in HR. Deploying AI in the ways described in the first three phases does of course have some downsides. Over the long term new technologies create more jobs than they destroy, but meanwhile labor markets may be painfully disrupted. What’s more, as Matt Beane argues in “Learning to Work with Intelligent Machines” (HBR, September–October 2019), companies that deploy AI can leave employees with fewer opportunities for hands-on learning and mentorship. When AI is a coach, it can easily seem like a competitor as well as a partner. There is some risk, therefore, not only of losing entry-level jobs (because digital assistants can effectively replace human ones) but also of compromising the ability of future decision makers to think for themselves. That’s not inevitable, however. As Beane suggests, companies could use their artificial intelligence to create different and better learning opportunities for their employees while improving the system by making it more transparent and giving employees more control. Because future entrants to the workforce will have grown up in a human-plus-machine workplace, they will almost certainly be faster than their pre-AI colleagues at spotting opportunities to innovate and introduce activities that add value and create jobs—which brings us to the final phase. Edwin Hutchins, a cognitive anthropologist, developed what is known as the theory of distributed cognition. It is based on his study of ship navigation, which, he showed, involved a combination of sailors, charts, rulers, compasses, and a plotting tool. The theory broadly relates to the concept of extended mind, which posits that cognitive processing, and associated mental acts such as belief and intention, are not necessarily limited to the brain, or even the body. External tools and instruments can, under the right conditions, play a role in cognitive processing and create what is known as a coupled system. In line with this thinking, in the final phase of the AI implementation journey (which to our knowledge no organization has yet adopted) companies would develop a coupled network of humans and machines in which both contribute expertise. We believe that as AI improves through its interactions with individual users, analyzing and even modeling expert users by drawing on data about their past decisions and behaviors, a community of experts (humans and machines) will naturally emerge in organizations that have fully integrated AI coachbots. For example, a purchasing manager who—with one click at the moment of decision—could see what price someone else would give could benefit from a customized collective of experts. Although the technology to create this kind of collective intelligence now exists, this phase is fraught with challenges. For example, any such integration of AI must avoid building in old or new biases and must respect human privacy concerns so that people can trust the AI as much as they would a human partner. That in itself is a pretty big challenge, given the volume of research demonstrating how hard it is to build trust among humans. The best approaches to building trust in the workplace rely on the relationship between trust and understanding—a subject of study by David Danks and colleagues at Carnegie Mellon. According to this model, I trust someone because I understand that person’s values, desires, and intentions, and they demonstrate that he or she has my best interests at heart. Although understanding has historically been a basis for building trust in human relationships, it is potentially well suited to cultivating human–AI partnerships as well, because employees’ fear of artificial intelligence is usually grounded in a lack of understanding of how AI works. In 2016 the investigative newsroom ProPublica published an exposé of a risk-prediction AI program known as COMPAS, which judges in southern Florida use to determine a defendant’s likelihood of re-offending within a specified time period. The algorithm underlying COMPAS is held as a trade secret by its manufacturer, Northpointe (now Equivant), which means that we don’t know how COMPAS generates its predictions, nor do we have access to the data the algorithm is trained on—so we cannot even inquire into its rationale. When it was reported that the algorithm produces disparate outcomes across race, COMPAS immediately became a leading example of why people cannot trust AI. If businesses want employees to adopt, use, and ultimately trust AI systems, it will be important to open up the black box—to the extent legally possible—to those who are expected to engage with the technology. As Richard Socher, the chief scientist at Salesforce, puts it, “If businesses use AI to make predictions, they owe humans an explanation as to how the decisions are made.” In building understanding, a particular challenge is defining what “explanation” means—let alone “good explanation.” This challenge is the focus of a lot of research. For example, one of us (Evgeniou) is working to open up machine-learning “black boxes” by means of so-called counterfactual explanations. A counterfactual explanation illuminates a particular decision of an AI system (for example, to approve credit for a given transaction) by identifying a short list of transaction characteristics that drove the decision one way or another. Had any of the characteristics been different (or counter to the fact), the system would have made a different decision (credit would have been denied). Evgeniou is also exploring what people perceive as good explanations for AI decisions. For example, do they see an explanation as better when it’s presented in terms of a logical combination of features (“The transaction was approved because it had X,Y,Z characteristics”) or when it’s presented relative to other decisions (“The transaction was approved because it looks like other approved transactions, and here they are for you to see”)? As research into what makes AI explainable continues, AI systems should become more transparent, thus facilitating trust.  Adopting new technologies has always been a major challenge—and the more impact a technology has, the bigger the challenge is. Because of its potential impact, artificial intelligence may be perceived as particularly difficult to implement. Yet if done mindfully, adoption can be fairly smooth. That is precisely why companies must ensure that AI’s design and development are responsible—especially with regard to transparency, decision autonomy, and privacy—and that it engages the people who will be working with it. Otherwise they will quite reasonably fear being constrained—or even replaced—by machines that are making all sorts of decisions in ways they don’t understand. Getting past these fears to create a trusting relationship with AI is key. In all four phases described in these pages, humans determine the ground rules. With a responsible design, AI may become a true partner in the workplace—rapidly processing large volumes of varied data in a consistent manner to enhance the intuition and creativity of humans, who in turn teach the machine.

"106",106,"https://hbr.org/2020/04/the-most-important-metrics-youre-not-tracking-yet","marketing.txt","A growing number of organizations are becoming more customer-centric by adopting, measuring, and optimizing CPIs — Customer Performance Indicators. These are the metrics that customers care about, as opposed to the ones that the company cares most about. Examples might include how fast customers can get a pricing quote, or getting a “first-time resolution” on a customer service call, or having a grocery delivery with “nothing broken.” While these examples may not be metrics that companies have traditionally tracked, they’re what customers actually care about. And by tracking what’s important to customers, companies have better visibility into actions they can take to improve customer outcomes, which directly impact business performance. It’s ironic in an age where so many companies proclaim to be customer-centric, customer-first, or customer-obsessed that most still focus only on company-centric metrics. Companies that transform to adopt CPIs — and the customer-centric culture and practices that CPIs engender — will increasingly outperform competitors and be better optimized for accelerated, differentiated, and defensible growth. Most leaders say they’re customer-centric, but if everything they measure is company-centric, how could that be true? Revenue, growth, and similar Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) measure how customers are performing for the company. But organizations that wish to be customer-centric (and maximize growth) must also measure how the company is performing for its customers. Now, while customers typically don’t have online dashboards with data visualizations that reflect how a company is performing for them, customers do bring to every interaction a purpose, problem, need, intent, or question — a desired outcome — along with expectations for how quickly or easily that outcome will be realized. These outcomes can be measured by associated Customer Performance Indicators, or CPIs. A growing number of organizations are becoming more customer-centric by adopting, measuring, and optimizing CPIs — whether their customers are consumers or business buyers. And because customers are the one and only thing that fuel growth, how well a company performs against CPIs often serves as the most powerful lever for, and the most accurate predictor of, growth. Consider an example from the insurance industry. When a customer is shopping around for insurance and submits an online form (or provides information over the phone), companies that provide pricing — the customer’s desired outcome — within seconds are much more likely to win the customer’s business than those who thank the customer for their inquiry and promise a future follow-up by an agent. In this case, the customer’s intended outcome and expectation is a fast quote. While one company is following its process of routing the inquiry to the appropriate agent according to geographic or other rules, the customer is collecting quotes from competitors. By the time an agent contacts the customer, she may have already completed her purchase from another company that performed better against her fast quote expectation. Insurance companies that measure and manage “Fast Quote” as a formal CPI find a direct correlation between performance on this CPI and growth. This is the primary rationale for adopting CPIs: The more your company’s attention is focused on outcomes important to your customers (CPIs), the better your company will likely perform on outcomes important to the business (KPIs). There are two elements that qualify a metric as a CPI. Most importantly, it must be an outcome customers say is important to them. Second, a CPI must be measurable in increments that customers actually value. Time, convenience, number of options, dollars saved, or recognition of their achievements are some increments that customers value, and there can be many others depending on the context, and if they’re deemed relevant by customers. Many assume that Net Promoter Score (NPS) — which measures a customer’s willingness to recommend a company’s products or services to others — is a CPI. But in reality, only companies care about their NPS; customers typically do not. So, NPS is just another KPI. While it may be a vague proxy for how well a company is performing for customers, unlike CPIs, NPS does not provide direct traceability to any single intended customer outcome or expectation, or show where the company may be falling short, all to the detriment of the company’s growth. Any group that directly or indirectly touches customers can use CPIs, including marketing, sales, product management, customer service, operations, and finance. Some real-world examples: While these examples may not be metrics that companies have traditionally tracked, they’re what customers actually care about. And by tracking what’s important to customers, companies have better visibility into actions they can take to improve customer outcomes, which directly impact business performance. When employees are only measured on and compensated for their performance on KPIs, they’re naturally incentivized to do whatever is necessary to achieve that outcome for the company. This often includes manipulating customers, which customers do not like. Conversely, when employees are accountable to CPIs, they’re motivated to help customers achieve the customer’s desired outcome. CPIs align employee and customer interests toward shared success. Is it any surprise, then, that companies adopting CPIs — with employee mindsets and behaviors focusing on customer outcomes — typically result in more (and often faster) sales? Or that customer sentiment, behavior, and loyalty typically improve? There are four common mistakes companies make when trying to define their own CPIs. These include: simply adopting CPIs from another company (which will only reveal what’s important to their customers); relying on expert judgement from internal teams who assume (usually inaccurately) that “we know our customers and what they need”; focus groups (which reveal misleading groupthink); and surveys, which are the most tempting of all because of relative speed and scale. None of these approaches work well for identifying the CPIs associated with the specific outcomes your customers expect when interacting with people, systems, processes, or policies in pursuit of their specific objectives. Instead, the most effective approach for identifying CPIs is contextual inquiry, an ethnographic research method in which specially trained researchers speak with or observe customers in the actual environments in which customers think about or try to achieve specific outcomes (homes, offices, stores, other locations, or traveling in between). Researchers trained in this type of ethnography know what to look for to reveal customer frustrations, expectations, and target outcomes at specific points of their journeys, and then ask the right series of open-ended questions to gain insights that surveys wouldn’t know to ask, and that customers might not be inclined to answer in a survey. Once you’ve determined your own CPIs, start measuring them and look for the potential relational impact each might have on one or more of your KPIs. The subsequent hypotheses you develop about CPI-KPI relationships can be proven or disproven by running controlled experiments. Once you’ve confirmed relationships between specific CPIs and KPIs, you can begin holding teams accountable to CPIs they can impact. Those employees will then be managing to the outcomes important to customers, which are what result in company growth. It’s ironic in an age where so many companies proclaim to be customer-centric, customer-first, or customer-obsessed that most still focus only on company-centric metrics. Companies that transform to adopt CPIs — and the customer-centric culture and practices that CPIs engender — will increasingly outperform competitors and be better optimized for accelerated, differentiated, and defensible growth.

"107",107,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/why-the-global-economy-is-recovering-faster-than-expected","strategy.txt","The coronavirus pandemic and ensuing global lockdowns led to fears of a systemic meltdown, but the recovery in the U.S. and around the world has been stronger — and faster — than many predicted. But will it last?  Looking at the sectors of the U.S. economy more closely, we can divide it into three parts that were impacted very differently: Sectors that were largely unaffected by Covid (ex: finance and housing); sectors that were impacted by lockdowns, but not social distancing that bounced back relatively quickly (ex: autos and durable goods); and sectors that are won’t be able to meaningfully recover until there’s a vaccine (ex: hospitality, travel). We’ve largely exhausted the “easy” phase of the recovery and the next leg hinges on that third group of sectors. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. The economic impact of coronavirus continues to surprise. In the spring, previously unimaginable shutdowns pushed economic activity to unimaginable lows. After the initial shock, however, perhaps the biggest surprise has been how fears of systemic meltdown remain unfulfilled — the initial bounce back was far stronger and sooner than expected, and some sectors of the U.S. and other economies have seen complete recoveries to pre-crisis levels of activity. While the stronger-than-expected recovery aligns with the business experience of many leaders we speak with, they still wonder what drove the gap between expectations and reality — and whether it can last. To answer these questions, we need to look at various recession types and their drivers, how Covid-19 fits in, and what this cycle’s idiosyncrasies are. As the coronavirus forced the economy into shutdown, a brutal economic contraction unfolded, breaking many (negative) records in the process. Yet, the sustained impact was broadly overestimated — both systemically and cyclically — as the intensity of the shock fueled widespread economic pessimism. Systemic fears were captured in the popular prediction of a new Great Depression, which would bring sovereign defaults, banking system collapse, and price deflation. Yet after a wobble prices stabilized, sovereign borrowing costs broadly fell across the world despite expansive borrowing, and the banking systems has shown few signs of liquidity problems. (In fact, after hoarding capital banks are looking to return capital again.) The broader systemic fears remain unfulfilled and never looked as perilous as in 2008. As systemic fears remained unfulfilled, cyclical fears also have proliferated. Unemployment — a cornerstone gauge of economic health — was expected to stay at high levels in the U.S. past the end of 2021. Analysts predicted waves of bankruptcies, a weakening housing market, and a potential collapse after an initial recovery in a “W”-shaped manner. Yet, here too the surprises have been to the upside. While still unacceptably high, unemployment fell much sooner and faster than thought: By September U.S. unemployment was lower than it was expected to be by the end of 2021. Housing showed remarkable resilience — with prices barely dipping and activity and sales bouncing back to or near the highs since the housing crisis. Many parts of the U.S. economy have returned to pre-crisis levels of activity. Indeed, as the 3Q GDP release last Thursday highlighted, over the last three months growth has been the highest ever recorded. While this does not indicate that the U.S. economy has returned to health or to pre-crisis levels of activity, it is testament to an extraordinarily vigorous rebound after a historically negative second quarter. These patterns are true around the world: Economic surprise indices, which show an amalgamation of the differences between realized and expected performance, have spiked to record highs everywhere — with the exception for China, where expectations for a full recovery were the baseline.  While many business leaders have seen these dynamics unfold in real time, they seek to understand the drivers that explain it in order to better see the path ahead. Charting recoveries remains exceptionally difficult (if not as difficult as predicting recessions), but there is value in thinking about the types of recession, their drivers, and impact — as well as about the idiosyncrasies that will shape the remaining recovery path. There are three dimensions of economic recessions which – when taken together – can help frame the dynamics of recovery. The Covid recession displays distinctive characteristics within this framework that help explain much of what has been on display: It’s quite possible that we were prepared for the worst with the Covid recession because the late and sluggish recovery from the Great Recession is still on our minds. And using the drivers outlined above we can see why: It started as an investment bust that turned into a financial crisis, which in turn impaired financial sector balance sheets and household balance sheets. This was met with a policy response that was quite delayed and kicked in after significant damage was already done. If that serves as in an implicit baseline for how recoveries play out, then the better than expected Covid trajectory should not surprise us. To gauge the next leg of recovery we need to go beyond the above drivers – think of them as the necessary foundations for a continued strong recovery – and look at the idiosyncrasies of the Covid recession for sufficient conditions that show how the strength could be delivered. Looking at the sectors of the U.S. economy more closely, we can divide it into three parts that were impacted very differently given the nature of the virus-driven recession. This suggests the “easy” phase of recovery is exhausted:  The next leg of a strong recovery thus hinges on that third group of sectors as the recovery potential of the second group is largely exhausted (and the first never dipped). This really moves the question of vaccines front and center. A timeline for the creation of a safe, effective vaccine that provides immunity for a significant time and can be rolled out quickly is fraught with uncertainty. Currently crowdsourced forecasts project a reasonable expectation that a vaccine will become available and meaningfully distributed (i.e. to those most vulnerable and those most at risk of spreading the virus) around Q2 2021. Neither the necessary nor the sufficient conditions outlined above are guaranteed. A lot can go wrong, and indeed fears of another economic collapse are common in public discourse. The truly bad scenario is often captured in warnings about a “W-shaped” recession, which would imply another phase of negative growth. In other words, after the collapse (Q2) and the very strong bounce (Q3) we would need Q4 (or Q1 2021) to be a second window of negative growth. How likely is this scenario? It would almost certainly require a renewed surge of the virus and stringent lockdown that would hamper the second group of sectors. Hospital capacity will prove the ultimate constraint on policy makers’ balancing act between keeping economic activity high and the population safe. While another lockdown is possible, as we’re seeing in Europe, in the U.S. selective shutdowns are more likely given political dynamics, leaving room for growth to stay above zero. And while positive growth remains our expectation for Q4 and 2021, a host of other risks lingers. A continued failure to extend fiscal stimulus measures could diminish the slope of recovery — or in the extreme turn it negative. A broader political failure — perhaps related to a contested election outcome — is also on the list of risks. In times of crisis it’s tempting to be pessimistic and fearful, particular if the drivers are unfamiliar or the risks pose credible systemic threats. However, this inclination to pessimism and retreat also carries risks itself and we should remind ourselves that 14% of firms across all sectors typically grow both revenues and margins during downturns. This is not just idiosyncratic luck — i.e. being in the right sector and seeing a demand boost because of the nature of the crisis — it’s driven by a firm’s ability to see beyond the acute phase of a crisis and exploit its idiosyncrasies to drive differential growth in new areas. While monitoring the overall macro landscape remains important, leaders should not underestimate the importance of measuring, interpreting, and exploiting the dynamics of their own sectors and markets in order to be able to invest and flourish during the recovery and the post-crisis period.

"108",108,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/managing-risk-and-resilience#building-organizational-resilience","strategy.txt","You’ve probably heard business leaders justify their  flat-footedness in a crisis by claiming that every organization is flying blind in times of deep uncertainty. But in fact some leaders know precisely where they’re going. They understand what’s required to chart a course through market turbulence, and they’ve built organizations with keen situational awareness. When it comes to developing the ability to figure out where things are heading and respond nimbly to a changing environment, nothing is more important than analytics. Unfortunately, in recent years analytics (also known as data mining or business intelligence) has become the unloved stepchild of data sciences, overshadowed by machine learning and statistics. Those two disciplines layer mathematical sophistication on top of a foundation of human intuition, creating an appealing illusion of objectivity and deft steering. Ironically, of the three, analytics is the most essential competency for navigating crises. Solutions based on AI and machine learning hum along well during stable times but fall apart when disaster strikes. These technologies automate tasks by extracting patterns from data and turning them into instructions. Such models can quickly become obsolete when the inputs to the system change. Analytics, in contrast, alerts you when the rules of the game are changing. Without that kind of a warning, automation solutions can quickly go off the rails, leaving you exposed to exogenous shocks. Statistics has a similar shortcoming during a crisis. Statisticians help decision-makers get rigorous answers. But what if they’re asking the wrong questions? While statistical skills are required to test hypotheses, analysts have the acumen to come up with the right hypotheses in the first place. To attempt statistics without analytics, you’d need great confidence in your assumptions—the kind of confidence that’s foolhardy when a crisis pulls the rug out from under you. Analysts thrive in ambiguity. Their talent is exploration, which makes them particularly good at foreseeing and responding to crises. By searching internal and external data sources for critical information, analysts keep a finger on the pulse of what’s going on. They scan the horizon for trends and formulate questions about what’s behind them. Their job is to inspire executives with thought-provoking yet qualified possibilities. Once the highest-priority hypotheses have been short-listed by leaders, then it’s time to call in a statistician to pressure-test them and separate true insights from red herrings. During good times, leading organizations build analytics capabilities to strengthen their ability to innovate. Analysts’ ability to find clues to such things as shifting consumer tastes can help firms take advantage of opportunities before less-savvy competitors do. When the going gets tough, however, what looked like a nice-to-have innovation booster turns into a must-have safety net. To be sure, some events are impossible to see in advance—the true black swans—but addressing their fallout is a game best played with open eyes. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to cobble together a mature analytics department on short notice. The technical skills that allow analysts to guzzle data with lightning speed merely increase the mass of information they encounter. Spotting a gem in it takes something more. Without domain knowledge, business acumen, and strong intuition about the practical value of discoveries—as well as the communication skills to convey them to decision-makers effectively—analysts will struggle to be useful. It takes time for them to learn to judge what’s important in addition to what’s interesting. You can’t expect them to be an instant solution to charting a course through your latest crisis. Instead, see them as an investment in your future nimbleness. It also takes time to secure access to the promising data sources analysts need. Ideally, business leaders won’t wait for a big disruption to begin building relationships with data vendors, industry partners, and data collection specialists. Bear in mind that in the face of an extreme shock, your historical data sources may become obsolete. If your understanding of the past fails to give you a useful window on tomorrow’s world—perhaps because a pandemic has changed everything—it doesn’t matter how good your information was yesterday. You need new information. After the 2008 financial crash, for example, banks around the world recognized that there might be an advantage to analyzing nontraditional signals of creditworthiness, such as data from supermarket loyalty cards, but not all players were equally positioned to get access to them. James Day/Gallery Stock Additionally, your internal data stores may require special processing before analysts can mine them, so it’s worth thinking about hiring supporting data engineers. If analytics is the discipline of making data useful, then data engineering is the discipline of making data usable; it provides behind-the-scenes infrastructure that makes machine logs and colossal data stores compatible with analytics tool kits. When I began speaking at conferences about the importance of analytics, I found that convincing an audience of its value was the easy part. The mood changed when I explained the catch: Analytics is a time investment. You can’t count on getting something useful out of every foray into a data set. To succeed at exploration, your organization needs a culture of no-strings-attached analytics. As the leader, you are responsible for setting the scope (which data sources should be looked at) and the time frame (“You have two weeks to explore this database”). Then you must ensure that analysts aren’t punished for coming back empty-handed. During an extreme shock, your historical data sources may become obsolete. Then it doesn’t matter how good your information was yesterday. You need new information. Once business leaders accept that analytics represents an investment that may not immediately pay off, I hit the next stumbling block: the perception that only a large and technologically sophisticated company such as Alphabet can afford it. This is nonsense. In my experience you’re more likely to find analytics thriving in start-ups than at well-established behemoths. Start-ups naturally invest in analytics as they try to navigate a new market, with several generalists taking on a share of the exploratory work. Then as the venture grows, the culture changes. Workers are trusted less and made more accountable for return on their efforts, and overzealous management stifles opportunities for analytics to thrive. Analysts hired into this culture rarely get to enjoy the most interesting part of their work—exploration—and instead serve as human search engines and dashboard janitors. Many quit out of frustration as their potential is squandered. Creating a culture where analytics flourishes takes thoughtful leadership. As organizations grow toward incumbency, only the most visionary will have the courage to nurture a true analytics department and make sure that business leaders have access to it and are influenced by it. Industries that have been burned by a previous crisis — banking is a good example — are especially likely to invest in analytics and apply it to risk management. Becoming a leader in analytics takes a commitment to trust your analysts and give them space to do their work. Their job, after all, will be to reveal threats that you never even imagined should be on your radar. That sort of work can’t be managed with a stopwatch and a checklist. Crises such as a pandemic—when no one has the answers, and uncertainty is high—remind us of the importance of asking the right questions. Analytics gives firms an edge in learning and adapting. When the world is suddenly upended, those who can learn the fastest are best positioned to succeed. Smart companies will invest in analytics today to get ahead of whatever is coming tomorrow.  There are ordinary, predictable risks—and then there are black swan events, tsunami risks, and disasters. In this month’s Spotlight package, the experts share advice on how to deal with threats that are unexpected and overwhelming.

"109",109,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-apple-is-organized-for-innovation","strategy.txt","When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, in 1997, it had a conventional structure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each with its own P&L responsibilities. Believing that conventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs laid off the general managers of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire company under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional departments of the business units into one functional organization. Although such a structure is common for small entrepreneurial firms, Apple—remarkably—retains it today, even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1997. In this article the authors discuss the innovation benefits and leadership challenges of Apple’s distinctive and ever-evolving organizational model in the belief that it may be useful for other companies competing in rapidly changing environments. Major companies competing in many industries struggle to stay abreast of rapidly changing technologies. They are typically organized into business units, each with its own set of functions. Thus the key decision makers—the unit leaders—lack a deep understanding of all the domains that answer to them. The company is organized around functions, and expertise aligns with decision rights. Leaders are cross-functionally collaborative and deeply knowledgeable about details. Apple is well known for its innovations  in hardware, software, and services. Thanks to them, it grew from some 8,000 employees and $7 billion in revenue in 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned, to 137,000 employees and $260 billion in revenue in 2019. Much less well known are the organizational design and the associated leadership model that have played a crucial role in the company’s innovation success.   When Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional structure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each with its own P&L responsibilities. General managers ran the Macintosh products group, the information appliances division, and the server products division, among others. As is often the case with decentralized business units, managers were inclined to fight with one another, over transfer prices in particular. Believing that conventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs, in his first year returning as CEO, laid off the general managers of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire company under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional departments of the business units into one functional organization. The adoption of a functional structure may have been unsurprising for a company of Apple’s size at the time. What is surprising—in fact, remarkable—is that Apple retains it today, even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1998. Senior vice presidents are in charge of functions, not products. As was the case with Jobs before him, CEO Tim Cook occupies the only position on the organizational chart where the design, engineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of Apple’s main products meet. In effect, besides the CEO, the company operates with no conventional general managers: people who control an entire process from product development through sales and are judged according to a P&L statement. Business history and organizational theory make the case that as entrepreneurial firms grow large and complex, they must shift from a functional to a multidivisional structure to align accountability and control and prevent the congestion that occurs when countless decisions flow up the org chart to the very top. Giving business unit leaders full control over key functions allows them to do what is best to meet the needs of their individual units’ customers and maximize their results, and it enables the executives overseeing them to assess their performance. As the Harvard Business School historian Alfred Chandler documented, U.S. companies such as DuPont and General Motors moved from a functional to a multidivisional structure in the early 20th century. By the latter half of the century the vast majority of large corporations had followed suit. Apple proves that this conventional approach is not necessary and that the functional structure may benefit companies facing tremendous technological change and industry upheaval. Apple’s commitment to a functional organization does not mean that its structure has remained static. As the importance of artificial intelligence and other new areas has increased, that structure has changed. Here we discuss the innovation benefits and leadership challenges of Apple’s distinctive and ever-evolving organizational model, which may be useful for individuals and companies wanting to better understand how to succeed in rapidly changing environments. Apple’s main purpose is to create products that enrich people’s daily lives. That involves not only developing entirely new product categories such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch, but also continually innovating within those categories. Perhaps no product feature better reflects Apple’s commitment to continuous innovation than the iPhone camera. When the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, Steve Jobs devoted only six seconds to its camera in the annual keynote event for unveiling new products. Since then iPhone camera technology has contributed to the photography industry with a stream of innovations: High dynamic range imaging (2010), panorama photos (2012), True Tone flash (2013), optical image stabilization (2015), the dual-lens camera (2016), portrait mode (2016), portrait lighting (2017), and night mode (2019) are but a few of the improvements. Apple leaders need deep expertise, immersion in details, and collaborative debate. To create such innovations, Apple relies on a structure that centers on functional expertise. Its fundamental belief is that those with the most expertise and experience in a domain should have decision rights for that domain. This is based on two views: First, Apple competes in markets where the rates of technological change and disruption are high, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people with deep knowledge of the technologies responsible for disruption. Long before it can get market feedback and solid market forecasts, the company must make bets about which technologies and designs are likely to succeed in smartphones, computers, and so on. Relying on technical experts rather than general managers increases the odds that those bets will pay off. Second, Apple’s commitment to offer the best possible products would be undercut if short-term profit and cost targets were the overriding criteria for judging investments and leaders. Significantly, the bonuses of senior R&D executives are based on companywide performance numbers rather than the costs of or revenue from particular products. Thus product decisions are somewhat insulated from short-term financial pressures. The finance team is not involved in the product road map meetings of engineering teams, and engineering teams are not involved in pricing decisions. We don’t mean to suggest that Apple doesn’t consider costs and revenue goals when deciding which technologies and features the company will pursue. It does, but in ways that differ from those employed by conventionally organized companies. Instead of using overall cost and price targets as fixed parameters within which to make design and engineering choices, R&D leaders are expected to weigh the benefits to users of those choices against cost considerations. In a functional organization, individual and team reputations act as a control mechanism in placing bets. A case in point is the decision to introduce the dual-lens camera with portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016. It was a big wager that the camera’s impact on users would be sufficiently great to justify its significant cost. One executive told us that Paul Hubel, a senior leader who played a central role in the portrait mode effort, was “out over his skis,” meaning that he and his team were taking a big risk: If users were unwilling to pay a premium for a phone with a more costly and better camera, the team would most likely have less credibility the next time it proposed an expensive upgrade or feature. The camera turned out to be a defining feature for the iPhone 7 Plus, and its success further enhanced the reputations of Hubel and his team. It’s easier to get the balance right between an attention to costs and the value added to the user experience when the leaders making decisions are those with deep expertise in their areas rather than general managers being held accountable primarily for meeting numerical targets. Whereas the fundamental principle of a conventional business unit structure is to align accountability and control, the fundamental principle of a functional organization is to align expertise and decision rights. Thus the link between how Apple is organized and the type of innovations it produces is clear. As Chandler famously argued, “structure follows strategy”—even though Apple doesn’t use the structure that he anticipated large multinationals would adopt. Now let’s turn to the leadership model underlying Apple’s structure. Ever since Steve Jobs implemented the functional organization, Apple’s managers at every level, from senior vice president on down, have been expected to possess three key leadership characteristics: deep expertise that allows them to meaningfully engage in all the work being done within their individual functions; immersion in the details of those functions; and a willingness to collaboratively debate other functions during collective decision-making. When managers have these attributes, decisions are made in a coordinated fashion by the people most qualified to make them. Apple is not a company where general managers oversee managers; rather, it is a company where experts lead experts. The assumption is that it’s easier to train an expert to manage well than to train a manager to be an expert. At Apple, hardware experts manage hardware, software experts software, and so on. (Deviations from this principle are rare.) This approach cascades down all levels of the organization through areas of ever-increasing specialization. Apple’s leaders believe that world-class talent wants to work for and with other world-class talent in a specialty. It’s like joining a sports team where you get to learn from and play with the best. Mikael Jansson/Trunk Archive Early on, Steve Jobs came to embrace the idea that managers at Apple should be experts in their area of management. In a 1984 interview he said, “We went through that stage in Apple where we went out and thought, Oh, we’re gonna be a big company, let’s hire professional management. We went out and hired a bunch of professional management. It didn’t work at all….They knew how to manage, but they didn’t know how to do anything. If you’re a great person, why do you want to work for somebody you can’t learn anything from? And you know what’s interesting? You know who the best managers are? They are the great individual contributors who never, ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be…because no one else is going to…do as good a job.” One current example is Roger Rosner, who heads Apple’s software application business, which includes work-productivity apps such as Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote (presentations) along with GarageBand (music composition), iMovie (movie editing), and News (an app providing news content). Rosner, who studied electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, joined Apple in 2001 as a senior engineering manager and rose to become the director of iWork applications, the vice president of productivity apps, and since 2013 the VP of applications. With his deep expertise gained from previous experience as the director of engineering at several smaller software companies, Rosner exemplifies an expert leading experts. In a functional organization, experts leading experts means that specialists create a deep bench in a given area, where they can learn from one another. For example, Apple’s more than 600 experts on camera hardware technology work in a group led by Graham Townsend, a camera expert. Because iPhones, iPads, laptops, and desktop computers all include cameras, these experts would be scattered across product lines if Apple were organized in business units. That would dilute their collective expertise, reducing their power to solve problems and generate and refine innovations. One principle that permeates Apple is “Leaders should know the details of their organization three levels down,” because that is essential for speedy and effective cross-functional decision-making at the highest levels. If managers attend a decision-making meeting without the details at their disposal, the decision must either be made without the details or postponed. Managers tell war stories about making presentations to senior leaders who drill down into cells on a spreadsheet, lines of code, or a test result on a product. Of course, the leaders of many companies insist that they and their teams are steeped in the details. But few organizations match Apple. Consider how its senior leaders pay extreme attention to the exact shape of products’ rounded corners. The standard method for rounding corners is to use an arc of a circle to connect the perpendicular sides of a rectangular object, which produces a somewhat abrupt transition from straight to curve. In contrast, Apple’s leaders insist on continuous curves, resulting in a shape known in the design community as a “squircle”: The slope starts sooner but is less abrupt. 
  An advantage of hardware products without abrupt changes in curvature is that they produce softer highlights (that is, little to no jump in light reflection along the corner). The difference is subtle, and executing on it isn’t simply a matter of a more complicated mathematical formula. It demands that Apple’s operations leaders commit to extremely precise manufacturing tolerances to produce millions of iPhones and other products with squircles. This deep immersion in detail isn’t just a concern that is pushed down to lower-level people; it is central at the leadership level.  Having leaders who are experts in their areas and can go deep into the details has profound implications for how Apple is run. Leaders can push, probe, and “smell” an issue. They know which details are important and where to focus their attention. Many people at Apple see it as liberating, even exhilarating, to work for experts, who provide better guidance and mentoring than a general manager would. Together, all can strive to do the best work of their lives in their chosen area. Apple has hundreds of specialist teams across the company, dozens of which may be needed for even one key component of a new product offering. For example, the dual-lens camera with portrait mode required the collaboration of no fewer than 40 specialist teams: silicon design, camera software, reliability engineering, motion sensor hardware, video engineering, core motion, and camera sensor design, to name just a few. How on earth does Apple develop and ship products that require such coordination? The answer is collaborative debate. Because no function is responsible for a product or a service on its own, cross-functional collaboration is crucial. When debates reach an impasse, as some inevitably do, higher-level managers weigh in as tiebreakers, including at times the CEO and the senior VPs. To do this at speed with sufficient attention to detail is challenging for even the best of leaders, making it all the more important that the company fill many senior positions from within the ranks of its VPs, who have experience in Apple’s way of operating. However, given Apple’s size and scope, even the executive team can resolve only a limited number of stalemates. The many horizontal dependencies mean that ineffective peer relationships at the VP and director levels have the potential to undermine not only particular projects but the entire company. Consequently, for people to attain and remain in a leadership position within a function, they must be highly effective collaborators. That doesn’t mean people can’t express their points of view. Leaders are expected to hold strong, well-grounded views and advocate forcefully for them, yet also be willing to change their minds when presented with evidence that others’ views are better. Doing so is not always easy, of course. A leader’s ability to be both partisan and open-minded is facilitated by two things: deep understanding of and devotion to the company’s values and common purpose, and a commitment to separating how right from how hard a particular path is so that the difficulty of executing a decision doesn’t prevent its being selected. The development of the iPhone’s portrait mode illustrates a fanatical attention to detail at the leadership level, intense collaborative debate among teams, and the power of a shared purpose to shape and ultimately resolve debates. In 2009 Hubel had the idea of developing an iPhone feature that would allow people to take portrait photos with bokeh—a Japanese term that refers to the pleasing blurring of a background—which photography experts generally consider to be of the highest quality. At that time only expensive single-lens reflex cameras could take such photos, but Hubel thought that with a dual-lens design and advanced computational-photography techniques, Apple could add the capability in the iPhone. His idea aligned well with the camera team’s stated purpose: “More people taking better images more of the time.” As the team worked to turn this idea into reality, several challenges emerged. The first attempts produced some amazing portrait pictures but also a number of “failure cases” in which the algorithm was unable to distinguish between the central object in sharp relief (a face, for instance) and the background being blurred. For example, if a person’s face was to be photographed from behind chicken wire, it was not possible to construct an algorithm that would capture the chicken wire to the side of the face with the same sharpness as the chicken wire in front of it. The wire to the side would be as blurred as the background. One might say, “Who cares about the chicken wire case? That’s exceedingly rare.” But for the team, sidestepping rare or extreme situations—what engineers call corner cases—would violate Apple’s strict engineering standard of zero “artifacts,” meaning “any undesired or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or technology.” Corner cases sparked “many tough discussions” between the camera team and other teams involved, recalls Myra Haggerty, the VP of sensor software and UX prototyping, who oversaw the firmware and algorithm teams. Sebastien Marineau-Mes, the VP to whom the camera software team ultimately reported, decided to defer the release of the feature until the following year to give the team time to better address failure cases—“a hard pill to swallow,” Hubel admits. To get some agreement on quality standards, the engineering teams invited senior design and marketing leaders to meet, figuring that they would offer a new perspective. The design leaders brought an additional artistic sensibility to the debate, asking, “What makes a beautiful portrait?” To help reassess the zero-artifacts standard, they collected images from great portrait photographers. They noted, among other things, that these photos often had blurring at the edges of a face but sharpness on the eyes. So they charged the algorithm teams with achieving the same effect. When the teams succeeded, they knew they had an acceptable standard. Another issue that emerged was the ability to preview a portrait photo with a blurred background. The camera team had designed the feature so that users could see its effect on their photos only after they had been taken, but the human interface (HI) design team pushed back, insisting that users should be able to see a “live preview” and get some guidance about how to make adjustments before taking the photo. Johnnie Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the camera team a demo. “When we saw the demo, we realized that this is what we needed to do,” Townsend told us. The members of his camera hardware team weren’t sure they could do it, but difficulty was not an acceptable excuse for failing to deliver what would clearly be a superior user experience. After months of engineering effort, a key stakeholder, the video engineering team (responsible for the low-level software that controls sensor and camera operations) found a way, and the collaboration paid off. Portrait mode was central to Apple’s marketing of the iPhone 7 Plus. It proved a major reason for users’ choosing to buy and delighting in the use of the phone. As this example shows, Apple’s collaborative debate involves people from various functions who disagree, push back, promote or reject ideas, and build on one another’s ideas to come up with the best solutions. It requires open-mindedness from senior leaders. It also requires those leaders to inspire, prod, or influence colleagues in other areas to contribute toward achieving their goals. While Townsend is accountable for how great the camera is, he needed dozens of other teams—each of which had a long list of its own commitments—to contribute their time and effort to the portrait mode project. At Apple that’s known as accountability without control: You’re accountable for making the project succeed even though you don’t control all the other teams. This process can be messy yet produce great results. “Good mess” happens when various teams work with a shared purpose, as in the case of the portrait mode project. “Bad mess” occurs when teams push their own agendas ahead of common goals. Those who become associated with bad mess and don’t or can’t change their behavior are removed from leadership positions, if not from Apple altogether. Apple’s way of organizing has led to tremendous innovation and success over the past two decades. Yet it has not been without challenges, especially with revenues and head count having exploded since 2008. As the company has grown, entering new markets and moving into new technologies, its functional structure and leadership model have had to evolve. Deciding how to organize areas of expertise to best enable collaboration and rapid decision-making has been an important responsibility of the CEO. The adjustments Tim Cook has implemented in recent years include dividing the hardware function into hardware engineering and hardware technologies; adding artificial intelligence and machine learning as a functional area; and moving human interface out of software to merge it with industrial design, creating an integrated design function. Another challenge posed by organizational growth is the pressure it imposes on the several hundred VPs and directors below the executive team. If Apple were to cap the size or scope of a senior leader’s organization to limit the number and breadth of details that the leader is expected to own, the company would need to hugely expand the number of senior leaders, making the kind of collaboration that has worked so well impossible to preserve. Cognizant of this problem, Apple has been quite disciplined about limiting the number of senior positions to minimize how many leaders must be involved in any cross-functional activity. In 2006, the year before the iPhone’s launch, the company had some 17,000 employees; by 2019 that number had grown more than eightfold, to 137,000. Meanwhile, the number of VPs approximately doubled, from 50 to 96. The inevitable result is that senior leaders head larger and more diverse teams of experts, meaning more details to oversee and new areas of responsibility that fall outside their core expertise. In response, many Apple managers over the past five years or so have been evolving the leadership approach described above: experts leading experts, immersion in the details, and collaborative debate. We have codified these adaptions in what we call the discretionary leadership model, which we have incorporated into a new educational program for Apple’s VPs and directors. Its purpose is to address the challenge of getting this leadership approach to drive innovation in all areas of the company, not just product development, at an ever-greater scale. When Apple was smaller, it may have been reasonable to expect leaders to be experts on and immersed in the details of pretty much everything going on in their organizations. However, they now need to exercise greater discretion regarding where and how they spend their time and efforts. They must decide which activities demand their full attention to detail because those activities create the most value for Apple. Some of those will fall within their existing core expertise (what they still need to own), and some will require them to learn new areas of expertise. Activities that require less attention from the leader can be pushed down to others (and the leaders will either teach others or delegate in cases where they aren’t experts). Rosner, the VP of applications, provides a good example. Like many other Apple managers, he has had to contend with three challenges arising from Apple’s tremendous growth. First, the size of his function has exploded over the past decade in terms of both head count (from 150 to about 1,000) and the number of projects under way at any given time. Clearly, he cannot dive into all the details of all those projects. Second, the scope of his portfolio has widened: Over the past 10 years he has assumed responsibility for new applications, including News, Clips (video editing), Books, and Final Cut Pro (advanced video editing). Although apps are his core area of expertise, some aspects of these—among them editorial content for News, how book publishing works, and video editing—involve matters in which Rosner is not an expert. Finally, as Apple’s product portfolio and number of projects have expanded, even more coordination with other functions is required, increasing the complexity of collaborating across the many units. For instance, whereas Rosner is responsible for the engineering side of News, other managers oversee the operating system on which it depends, the content, and the business relationships with content creators (such as the New York Times) and advertisers. To cope, Rosner has adapted his role. As an expert who leads other experts, he had been immersed in details—especially those concerning the top-level aspects of software applications and their architecture that affect how users engage with the software. He also collaborated with managers across the company in projects that involved those areas. But with the expansion of his responsibilities, he has moved some things from his owning box—including traditional productivity apps such as Keynote and Pages—into his teaching box. 
  Now he guides and gives feedback to other team members so that they can develop software applications according to Apple’s norms. Being a teacher doesn’t mean that Rosner gives instruction at a whiteboard; rather, he offers strong, often passionate critiques of his team’s work. (Clearly, general managers without his core expertise would find it difficult to teach what they don’t know.)  The second challenge for Rosner involved the addition of activities beyond his original expertise. Six years ago he was given responsibility for the engineering and design of News. Consequently, he had to learn about publishing news content via an app—to understand news publications, digital advertising, machine learning to personalize news content, architecting for privacy, and how to incentivize publishers. Thus some of his work fell into the learning box. Here managers face a steep learning curve to acquire new skills. Given how demanding this is, only critical new activities should fall into this category. Over six years of intense learning, Rosner has mastered some of these areas, which are now in his owning box. As long as a particular activity remains in the learning box, leaders must adopt a beginner’s mindset, questioning subordinates in a way that suggests they don’t already know the answer (because they don’t). This differs starkly from the way leaders question subordinates about activities in the owning and teaching boxes. Finally, Rosner has delegated some areas—including iMovie and GarageBand, in which he is not an expert—to people with the requisite capabilities. For activities in the delegating box, he assembles teams, agrees on objectives, monitors and reviews progress, and holds the teams accountable: the stuff of general management. Whereas Apple’s VPs spend most of their time in the owning and learning boxes, general managers at other companies tend to spend most of their time in the delegating box. Rosner estimates that he spends about 40% of his time on activities he owns (including collaboration with others in a given area), about 30% on learning, about 15% on teaching, and about 15% on delegating. These numbers vary by manager, of course, depending on their business and the needs at a given time. The discretionary leadership model preserves the fundamental principle of an effective functional organization at scale—aligning expertise and decision rights. Apple can effectively move into new areas when leaders like Rosner take on new responsibilities outside their original expertise, and teams can grow in size when leaders teach others their craft and delegate work. We believe that Apple will continue to innovate and prosper by being organized this way. Apple’s functional organization is rare, if not unique, among very large companies. It flies in the face of prevailing management theory that companies should be reorganized into divisions and business units as they become large. But something vital gets lost in a shift to business units: the alignment of decision rights with expertise. Why do companies so often cling to having general managers in charge of business units? One reason, we believe, is that making the change is difficult. It entails overcoming inertia, reallocating power among managers, changing an individual-oriented incentive system, and learning new ways of collaborating. That is daunting when a company already faces huge external challenges. An intermediate step may be to cultivate the experts-leading-experts model even within a business unit structure. For example, when filling the next senior management role, pick someone with deep expertise in that area as opposed to someone who might make the best general manager. But a full-fledged transformation requires that leaders also transition to a functional organization. Apple’s track record proves that the rewards may justify the risks. Its approach can produce extraordinary results."
"110",110,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/the-ceo-of-iberdrola-on-committing-to-clean-energy","strategy.txt","In 2001 Iberdrola, which had resulted from a merger between two Spanish utilities nearly 10 years before, held assets that were primarily sustainable but included some power-generation plants fired by oil and coal. Its footprint was limited to Spain and a bit of Latin America. Looking for a CEO who was willing to challenge traditional industry models and build a better future, the company tapped Galán. His values gave him the grounding to design and lead Iberdrola’s green mission, and he describes the past two decades as some of the most rewarding of his career. He and his team focused an ambitious strategy on their core business of generating and distributing sustainable and renewable energy through plants, networks, and storage facilities, doubling down on a low-carbon future. Competitors thought they were crazy, and regulators raised a skeptical brow. Some senior executives retired or left. But since then Iberdrola has expanded into dozens of countries on four continents, grown to serve 100 million people with power, created one of the largest wind energy companies in the world, and closed all its oil and coal plants. Its net profit of 3.4 billion euros in 2019 represents a fivefold increase since 2001. I will never forget the day Íñigo de Oriol e Ybarra, the former chairman of Iberdrola, asked me to join the company as its new CEO. Iberdrola was the second-largest Spanish utility, after the state-owned Endesa. At the time, I was leading Airtel Movil, the Spanish mobile telecom company that in just five years had become the main competitor of Telefónica. Airtel had recently been acquired by Vodafone, and I had been asked to stay on under the new parent company. But I got a surprise call from Íñigo de Oriol, whom I knew by reputation. He asked me to meet him at a Madrid hotel bar frequented by the city’s top executives, bankers, and politicians. I walked in at 7 PM and found him at a central table. He got right down to business: “Ignacio, you need to join me. Come lead Iberdrola.” This was not said in a whisper; his voice was so loud everyone around us could hear. Iberdrola was the result of the merger of two Spanish utilities about 10 years before. Its assets, unlike those of many other energy companies at the time, were primarily sustainable: hydro and nuclear. But it also had some oil- and coal-fired power-generation plants, and its footprint was limited to Spain and a bit of Latin America. The company needed a CEO who was willing to challenge traditional industry models and build a better future. Needless to say, I decided to seize that opportunity. I was appointed CEO in 2001 and then chairman and CEO in 2006. The past two decades have been some of the most rewarding of my career. Thanks to the hard work of our entire team, we have expanded into dozens of countries on four continents, grown to serve 100 million people with power, created one of the largest wind energy companies in the world, and closed all our oil and coal plants. It wasn’t easy to commit to a growth strategy based on clean energy and reducing our operating emissions by 50% by 2030—before virtually anyone else in our industry was making any such promises. But it was the right decision. And in recent years we have been rewarded for our foresight. Since 2001 we have grown from about the 20th-largest worldwide electric utility to the third-largest, with our size and results multiplying by a factor of five. Most important, employees and subcontractors around the world consistently tell both us and rating organizations that Iberdrola is a great place to work. Our story should be instructive for any company interested in remaking its strategy in a way that benefits all stakeholders and promotes more-sustainable living. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic and social fallout, it will be critically important to build back better than before. And we can. It just takes values, vision, focus, and a lot more urgency than patience. Iberdrola the corporate brand was born in 1992, when Iberduero merged with Hidroeléctrica Española. In 2001, following my arrival, the company adopted a strategic plan that anticipated the world’s need for more clean energy and called for global expansion with the aim of doubling the size of the company’s revenue and EBITDA in just five years. We met that goal. Now Iberdrola was ready for the next step. My background had prepared me for the challenge. After graduating as an industrial engineer from ICAI, the engineering school of Universidad Pontificia Comillas, in Madrid, I went to work for a car-battery manufacturer and rose through the executive ranks. I then moved on to lead two aerospace-engine makers before my time building Airtel Movil into the second-largest telecom company in Spain and a Vodafone acquisition target. (It is now Vodafone España.) Both the board and I recognized that my previous experience was relevant. My engineering degree meant I could understand the details of the business. I’d led teams of engineers on complex projects and had built and sold highly technical products. I’d developed and executed on an ambitious B2C growth strategy. And my values gave me the grounding to design and lead Iberdrola’s green mission. I have a love for nature born during a village childhood surrounded by cows, horses, rabbits, trees, streams, and fields, and I abide by the Jesuit calling to serve not only oneself or—in the case of a corporate executive—one’s investors but all stakeholders and the broader society. Competitors thought I was crazy: Wind power was in its infancy, and solar was prohibitively expensive, so no one understood why I wanted to target renewable energy. Once in the CEO seat, my first job was to finally complete the merger that had been signed so many years before. I needed to make sure we were all rowing in the same direction. For months I talked to people around the company—in 10 to 15 meetings a day—and asked about their perceptions and priorities. I still have the sticky notes. I sought advice from professors, mentors, former colleagues, contacts within and outside the energy industry, even my son. What I discovered was that we had many good people who could unite around some key corporate values: hard work, honesty, loyalty, and team spirit. We also needed vision: a more ambitious strategy focused squarely on our core business of generating and distributing sustainable and renewable energy through plants, networks, and storage facilities. As world governments began taking climate change seriously and setting carbon emissions reduction targets, we aimed to leave fossil fuels and other interests (small stakes in Telefónica and Spanish media and property) and double down on that low-carbon future. And to have real impact, we had to transition from being a nearly 100% Spanish company to being a truly global one. My team and I worked on a plan and presented it to the board, explaining that it would require a €12 billion investment over five years, even as we accrued proceeds from divestitures. We would invest in acquisitions, new ventures, digitization, and the well-educated and -trained talent we would need to execute the plan. The board gave its approval within a day. Of course, we heard criticism from other corners. Competitors thought I was crazy: Wind power was in its infancy, and solar was prohibitively expensive, so no one understood why I wanted to target renewable energy. Regulators raised a skeptical brow. Some senior executives retired or left. Change is never easy. But after those departures and a few key hires, I knew I had a team committed to our plan, values, target, and goals. I won buy-in from employees through constant engagement. In those early years I started hosting hundreds of people in large town-hall-style gatherings. If we were scheduled for two hours, I would open with a 10-minute speech and spend the rest of the time answering questions. I also took online queries and feedback via our corporate intranet. Over and over, I explained what we aimed to do, where we wanted to go, and why it would be good for everyone. I still do this regularly. Believe it or not, the biggest hurdle in the whole transition process may have been persuading the board to change our blue logo to the green, blue, and orange leaves you see today. Everyone was used to the existing color and image, which had been around for decades. But I wanted a logo that symbolized our future. I had to plead my case over the course of three meetings. For the last one my team and I pulled out all the stops: We decorated the boardroom green, set a corridor of green flags along the road that fronts our Madrid headquarters, and lined up a fleet of green cars outside. The directors finally agreed. Then the work began, starting with divestitures and closures. We began phasing out oil- and coal-fired power plants and announced our final closure in 2017. We also sold off our nonenergy businesses. Then we turned our attention to renewable energy, smart grids, and storage, both at home and abroad. Most Spanish companies start with Latin America. Indeed, Iberdrola had already done that to a limited extent. Without setting aside that region, I was interested in countries with high credit ratings, more-predictable regulation, and stabler legal frameworks. They may not be as profitable as emerging countries, but they’re less risky. And our board and shareholders were expecting us to make safe and long-term—not speculative—investments. By 2007 we had integrated ScottishPower, which had a few fossil-fuel-dependent facilities but was moving toward a focus on wind; its subsidiary PPM Energy was at the time the second-largest wind farm operator in the United States. The £11.6 billion all-stock deal made us the third-largest utility in Europe. Many questioned whether a Spanish company could manage a traditional British utility. I remember that one competitor launched a campaign with a picture of a flamenco dancer, inviting our customers to switch to it. But when we presented our philosophy and targets to executives, shareholders, and local politicians, they bought in. And, as with subsequent foreign acquisitions, we kept the local team in place while transitioning the business in the same way our Spanish one had—moving out of unsustainable and high-carbon businesses and investing in sustainable and low-carbon ones. Our next move was in the United States: We acquired Energy East, a utility that then had more than 3 million electricity and gas customers spanning New England and New York. The investment community, particularly Wall Street, remained skeptical at first. It viewed us as Spaniards trying to push some crazy ideas through a heavily regulated industry in various parts of the world. And engineers aren’t always the greatest salespeople. But after further growth and mergers, our Avangrid business in the United States has $30 billion in assets and is listed on the NYSE with more than $15 billion in market capitalization at the time of this writing. I should point out that not everything we heard in the early days was negative; as we set out to implement our new strategy, we heard some positive voices, too. Even as far back as 2002, the analyst who covered us for UBS published a report called “Kiss the Frog,” referring to our new green image and suggesting that we now looked pretty attractive. The financial community started to believe, as we did, that our goals were achievable. We pressed on. In Brazil we bought and built assets and companies that now make up Neoenergia, which was successfully listed in 2019. We operate across 18 states in the country, covering all areas of the energy value chain—from wind and hydro and gas generation to transmission and distribution networks—and supplying energy to 35 million people. In Mexico we have grown over 20 years to become the country’s largest private generator of electricity. We have since invested in hydro and wind and solar in Portugal and in offshore wind in Germany and France, and we’ve established sustainable operations in Greece and Hungary. In 2020 we took our first steps in Australia, a country with huge renewable-energy potential. That has helped make us one of the top five electricity utilities in the world and a leader in wind power. And we continue to build out our operations in the United States and the United Kingdom, particularly with wind farms, while closing coal-fired facilities. Back home in Spain we’ve expanded hydroelectric capacity and deployed smart grids and meters around the country. We are now the country’s largest electricity company, supplying 20 million people—almost half the population. We plan to triple our renewables business here in the coming years. We are also investing in electric mobility, photovoltaics, battery storage systems, and blockchain technology to guarantee that our energy is 100% clean. At Iberdrola we are working to benefit society and our employees as well as shareholders. Since 2001 we have invested more than €100 billion in cleaner energy, smarter networks, and storage around the world. In 2019 our carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of electricity generated were just one-third the average among our competitors in Europe. For the second year in a row, Corporate Knights named us one of the world’s top 100 sustainable companies. The Ethisphere Institute has also rated us one of the world’s most ethical companies for seven consecutive years. In 2018 we received both the European Environmental Award from the king of Spain and an award from Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project, and we have been included on the FTSE4Good Index for a decade. We support 400,000 jobs around the world and focus on training and development, including company-sponsored university programs and classes on our own campuses. For just one example of how international and highly educated our teams are now: Our offshore wind design group consists of close to 1,000 people in four countries (a UK base plus the United States, Germany, and France) representing 18 nationalities and dozens of expertise areas, from marine biology to drilling, corrosion to weather. Internal surveys show that nearly 90% of our employees would recommend working for Iberdrola. The investment community remained skeptical at first. It viewed us as Spaniards trying to push some crazy ideas through a heavily regulated industry. Meanwhile, our net profit of €3.4 billion in 2019 represents a fivefold increase since 2001. In fact, since 2001 the total return for shareholders has been about 715%. Not only are we more profitable but we’re creating a stronger workforce; a cleaner, more efficient operation; and a safer world. Investors and analysts joke with me about some European competitors who are now trying to follow our strategy after years of milking fossil fuels. I say, “Welcome.” Climate change has become a climate emergency, and we need everyone on board to fight it. In a post-Covid world clean energy will offer real opportunities to drive economic growth, support industry, and create jobs. We believe that leaders in any organization, in any sector, can build companies that exist to benefit not just shareholders but also their workers and society. We must ensure that the business world puts sustainability and a future orientation at the forefront of strategy. It is both an obligation and an opportunity."

This has altered customer needs, accelerated the entry of new types of competitors, and generated novel opportunities for value creation. It has also transformed how the function must work, requiring that it become more agile, interdependent, and accountable for driving firm growth. The authors provide a framework to help leaders identify the organizational design and capabilities needed to build a competitive, next-generation marketing function. Their framework has been used to guide marketing transformations at companies across industries, including consumer packaged goods, transportation, financial services, and retail. Leaders are finding it difficult to think clearly about the role of the marketing function and are anxious about its performance. Yet their efforts to transform marketing have at times been stymied by the lack of a clear methodology for defining its job and designing its work. The authors offer a practical framework for clarifying how marketing can contribute to company growth by delivering distinctive types of value to customers and to the organization itself. Companies across industries have applied this framework to reveal the gap between their existing and needed areas of focus; to determine which capabilities to develop, which to sustain at their current level, and which to scale down, outsource, or automate; and to redesign their marketing functions to deliver on a new value proposition. Marketing has never been more complex. Sweeping  advances in technology have revolutionized and fragmented the discipline, while societal issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the climate crisis have raised expectations for marketers’ social performance. This combination of diverse forces has transformed how the marketing function must work, requiring that it become more agile, interdependent, and accountable for driving company growth.   It’s no wonder that leaders are uncertain about marketing’s role and anxious about its performance. Our survey of marketing managers at 493 companies found that just 20% of those in traditional corporations are satisfied with the effectiveness of their departments; the percentage is only marginally higher among those in digital-native companies. With the support of the Mobile Marketing Association and in collaboration with Peter Schelstraete, formerly the global vice president of digital and assets at Coca-Cola, we spent two years studying the change in marketing organizations. We conducted in-depth interviews with 125 senior marketing leaders across industries to understand the problem and to learn how they were adapting their organizations to compete in this new environment. Most of them, we found, strategically invested in marketing activities, technologies, and structures in order to capitalize on new growth opportunities. Yet many of their efforts to transform marketing organizations were complicated by the lack of a structured methodology. To create a practical framework that companies could use, we started by identifying the ways in which a marketing function can contribute to company growth. That led us to define six broad areas of value. We then developed an inventory of 72 marketing capabilities, spanning both new and foundational tasks, that are needed to create that value. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive compendium of its kind. With input from a steering committee composed of 10 chief marketing officers of leading companies, we then created the analytic process presented here. It can be used to define a marketing value proposition, select the necessary capabilities, and design a competitive next-generation function. Our model has now guided marketing transformations at digital-native and traditional companies across industries, including consumer packaged goods, transportation, financial services, and retail. We found that marketing leaders struggle with transformation efforts for three key reasons. First, they often look at the transformation as an exercise in retooling technology or reshaping structures rather than rethinking how a changing environment can enable the function to create new types of value. Second, they commonly frame transformation projects as a transition from one state to another—for example, from brand to performance marketing or, simply, old to new. That mindset can inhibit synergies between traditional and current marketing practices, splinter teams, and distract from a focus on customers. Third, leaders often allow modernization efforts to be dispersed across teams or functional areas without a holistic operating framework. As a result, various groups may be pursuing distinct and uncoordinated change initiatives, fragmenting value-creation efforts, and undermining marketing’s ability to drive growth. The Covid-19 pandemic has raised expectations for marketers’ social performance. Without a clear, value-based goal for marketing and a strategy for determining the capabilities needed to achieve it, new technologies, structures, and processes are unlikely to deliver substantial improvements in performance. Our framework provides both the goal and the strategy. It divides the six kinds of value created into two categories: value for customers and value for the company. Understanding this taxonomy is the first step in articulating your marketing value proposition and the starting point for aligning marketing’s activities with the company’s growth strategy. In the effort to attract, acquire, and retain customers, a marketing team can create value for them in three areas: exchange, experience, and engagement. Marketers create this kind of value when they effectively match their offerings to specific customer needs. That requires recognizing when customers are looking for a particular product or service, understanding what problem they are trying to solve, and figuring out what offerings will suit them best—in real time. It calls for sharp conversion, personalization, and prediction capabilities. To maximize exchange value, marketers use sophisticated analytics and machine learning to process vast amounts of data on consumer behavior. Allstate, for example, targets dozens of customer types with hundreds of products and tailored messages developed through the use of AI. Alibaba draws on real-time data and continuously fine-tuned learning algorithms to deliver personalized offers to millions of customers. MTailor uses an AI-powered app to measure customers’ fit and deliver customized clothing, and Stitch Fix depends on machine learning to help personalize wardrobe recommendations. The exchange-value-focused CMOs in our study embrace computer science and are emphatic about the importance of AI in shaping the marketing discipline. As one of them put it, “If you can’t have a conversation about pixels or attribution models, you are stuck in the past.” Marketers focused on creating this kind of value work to eliminate hassles and enhance satisfaction across the customer journey. That requires a focus on improving journey orchestration, value augmentation, and offering design through constant innovation. Delta Air Lines, for instance, has become a master at anticipating travelers’ needs and addressing them with customized messages. The airline enhances its core product—the flight—by smoothing the service experience around it, providing advice and information on traffic to and from the airport, in-flight dining choices, boarding status, baggage location, and more. Such service proficiency across the customer journey improves both customer satisfaction and loyalty. Some companies are creating new types of experience value in China by innovatively integrating mobile technology and delivery infrastructures. For example, KFC’s Shanghai stores accept orders via mobile apps and deliver food to long-distance train passengers at their stop of choice. This type of value enhances the “meaning” of a company’s offering—how customers perceive the brand and their relationship with it. Companies increasingly create it by merging traditional techniques such as storytelling and public relations with dynamic content-management systems that facilitate and sometimes automate the design and delivery of real-time messages. They also nurture a sense of community among users and go beyond a product’s traditional functional or emotional benefits to offer societal benefits—for example, by adopting an environmental or social mission. Creating engagement value requires marketers to build purpose and communities, optimize connections, and design stories to strengthen customer relationships. Brands across sectors have embraced social activism in authentic ways: REI, with its focus on environmental stewardship; Always, with its commitment to strengthening self-esteem among young women; and Danone, as a champion of more-sustainable food, to name just a few. All these brands have nurtured active customer involvement with their social efforts. Their work has reinforced meaning, relevance, and trust and led to levels of engagement that would have been difficult to achieve through product-centered efforts alone. Marketers can also increase engagement value by encouraging customers to interact with one another, asking questions, sharing knowledge, and collaborating. To this end, Salesforce created the Trailblazer Community, where customers can join dozens of user groups across industries to share their experiences with the company’s products. Similarly, Glossier, a direct-to-consumer beauty-products brand, facilitates community groups focused on pertinent topics. User groups help these companies understand customer needs, enhance retention, lower acquisition costs, generate product ideas, and smooth the introduction of innovations. For instance, Glossier is exploring social commerce that involves community members who act as influencers and even sell its products. The marketing function can also contribute to growth by generating internal value for a company in three areas: strategic, operational, and knowledge. Marketing teams often spot ways to expand current offerings and guide the development of new offerings and business models. To do this they need the ability to discover growth, build platforms, and leverage assets. Traditionally they focused to a large extent on identifying opportunities for line extensions within a given product category. Today technology allows marketers to help companies enter new categories and even industries as never before. Consider Google’s move into autonomous vehicles. The company has continually expanded its capabilities and brand meaning, enabling it to compete in businesses that its former sector rival Yahoo would be hard-pressed to try. The energy drink Red Bull has likewise broken through category boundaries, creating the successful sports and lifestyle platform Red Bull Media House. Marketing teams can also help companies capture new revenue streams from existing assets or practices—for example, by monetizing marketing data and activities. Amazon’s advertising unit has reported revenue of $10 billion from product sponsorships, placements, the creation of brand-specific stores, and other efforts. Target has created a new revenue stream with Roundel, its recently rebranded media network, which develops content and campaigns for its brand and agency clients, using its own customer data. Caterpillar has placed sensors in more than a million products to generate utilization data services that help large construction and mining companies optimize the maintenance and use of their equipment. Marketing leaders can also play a central role in creating or identifying new business models and technologies that spur customer demand. For example, many large companies—Unilever among them—have established units to manage investments in start-ups and new ventures in emerging marketing technology or entertainment services that, among other things, can help shape product, service, or marketing efforts. Marketing’s role in strengthening a company’s operating effectiveness has never been more important. Yet many marketing leaders struggle with the proliferation of independent and specialized teams engaged in an expanding array of activities across the organization. Because these teams often have divergent methods and views about the role of marketing and its contribution to growth, their work can be hard to integrate. As one of the executives in our study explained, “No technology in the world, no digital marketing, no attribution model, can overcome a lack of alignment across an organization. If one team is measuring success one way and another team is measuring success another way—good luck making it work.” The key here is the ability to improve talent management, enhance organizational links, and strengthen execution methods and technology. Marketing organizations create operational value for a company by aligning disparate teams around a shared growth agenda and marketing approach and increasing their speed, agility, and collaboration. In part that requires constantly upgrading marketing technologies to automate and integrate many aspects of customer relationship management at scale and in real time. We saw three strategies for achieving this. First, effective CMOs establish a clear set of marketing principles and methods—a blueprint for getting the function’s work done. It includes developing shared language and frameworks, understanding how relevant key performance indicators are connected, and creating common accounting standards and flexible decision processes. Second, they foster an organizational culture that focuses on customer needs and more-fluid interactions between areas of expertise. One tool we saw put to that purpose was “key behavioral indicators” (KBIs), such as levels of interpersonal trust and transparency, which were accorded the same status as KPIs in performance evaluations. That’s because when performance on KBIs falls, one CMO told us, the time needed for alignment and coordination increases, reducing speed to market. Samm Escobar Third, these CMOs adopt technologies that help reduce the costs of coordination and collaboration and increase efficiency, transparency, and trust by enabling interaction across teams. Those technologies include project management applications such as Slack, communication platforms, knowledge management systems, and live meeting webcasts to promote inclusion. In its role representing the “voice of the customer,” the marketing function can create knowledge value, principally through the astute use of data science. Some established customer-intelligence activities, such as user-needs assessments and sentiment tracking, remain important. But newer technologies open up further opportunities. For example, AI-powered data analytics systems can increasingly tease out the causal relationship between marketing investments and business outcomes, improving marketing efficiency. The success of such initiatives depends on enhancing data creation and management, leveraging market and customer intelligence, and advancing marketing analytics. In addition, new technologies are enabling ever more innovative ways for companies to capture market signals and use data. For instance, the Freestyle vending machine installed by Coca-Cola across thousands of quick-service restaurants allows customers to select from dozens of flavor mixes, which are individually dispensed. By tracking and reporting these orders, the machines provide granular, real-time, first-party data on consumer preferences: a highly valuable asset for a non-direct-to-consumer firm. The company has used this data to inform its R&D and to launch new products. Samm Escobar As a major producer and user of data, marketing can also create knowledge value by collaborating with IT and data science teams to generate a single source of market intelligence, devise ways to define and measure key marketing metrics, and develop mechanisms for protecting customer information. Adobe executives credit the creation of such a “single source of truth” as a key turning point in accelerating the company’s transformation effort. With a clear understanding of these six broad types of value and the capabilities needed to deliver them, leaders can gauge the importance of each to future growth. That analysis will yield the function’s value proposition—its statement of purpose. Using our framework, a team of marketing leaders and other executives can engage in a series of sessions in which they systematically rate the importance to growth over the coming two or three years of each of the 72 capabilities underpinning the six value areas. For example, they can ask, Within exchange value, how important to growth on a 1 (low) to 10 (high) scale will trend forecasting be? Product personalization? Marketing automation? And so on. Marketing can create knowledge value by collaborating with data science teams. The team can use a discrete-choice method such as conjoint analysis or MaxDiff to analyze data from various stakeholders in determining the relative importance of the types of value. This step helps leaders think clearly about the difference between the value that marketing currently creates and what it should create according to its potential to drive sales, profits, and company growth. For instance, our analyses across 10 industries show that technology-enabled convenience benefits are more important to buyers of services than to buyers of products. In contrast, purpose-related benefits, such as a brand’s stance on social issues, are more important to buyers of consumer packaged goods than to buyers of services. During this exercise it is important to be clear about what’s feasible. We have seen no company become “best in class” in all six areas simultaneously; instead each organization makes careful choices about what it will focus on given its growth goals, industry conditions, competitive environment, and other factors that affect strategy. All companies have constraints related to finances, data availability, and their marketing function’s heritage. The key in refining the marketing value proposition is to determine which subset of value areas marketing can best develop, given its resources and constraints. This exercise reveals where the greatest opportunity to create value lies and what specific capabilities will be needed to realize it. The team can gauge marketing’s readiness to deliver by scoring its current performance on each of the 72 capabilities. (See the sidebar “A Digital Scoring Tool” for how to access a simplified version of our assessment.) When those scores are plotted on a chart, gaps between current capabilities and future needs reveal where the organization should act. The scoring exercise we describe here can be done manually. For a quick introduction to our analytic process, readers can take a simplified version of the online assessment created by our firm, MarCaps, which provides a general score for the fit between a company’s current and necessary marketing capabilities, and benchmarks the organization against others that have used the tool. The assessment is available at www.marcaps.com/research. This analysis won’t yield a mandate for specific change. Rather, it will provide a road map showing a variety of paths that leaders can follow, taking into account the company’s priorities and capabilities. Typically, companies select a subset of areas for investment, considering both the fit level revealed by the analysis and the efforts that will be required to address those areas. Once marketing’s areas of strength and weakness have been identified, it’s clearer which capabilities to develop, which to sustain at their current level, and which to scale down, outsource, or automate. But it’s usually easier for leaders to launch new initiatives or even maintain the status quo than to pull resources from existing activities. In our conversations with CMOs, many talked about the challenge, and the importance, of deciding what not to do, particularly in large organizations where resources and an appetite for exploration may be substantial. This exercise will yield a road map with a variety of paths leaders can follow. Consider how the chief marketing officer of a leading transportation technology firm we worked with applied the framework. She formed a marketing transformation team that included the marketing directors of each geographic region, members of the global marketing organization, and representatives from human resources. In a series of work sessions over six weeks, the team rated the importance to company growth of capabilities within each area and aligned around a value proposition that focused on increasing exchange, engagement, operational, and knowledge value. We then worked with the team to evaluate the current level of each capability and the level needed to help deliver on the new value proposition. In a final work session the leaders made specific choices about their organizational priorities for the following year and where they needed to invest to achieve them. This process underscores the assessment’s role as a form of guidance rather than a strict mandate. Although the analysis revealed opportunities for improvement in each of the value categories the team selected, the group decided not to invest substantially at that time in enhancing strategic value. The CMO and her team clearly saw an opportunity to create that kind of value by finding new sources of revenue, but various organizational constraints suggested that they could reap a higher ROI on their investments in capability building elsewhere. The priorities they selected included prediction and conversion management, storytelling and content personalization, market and customer intelligence, talent enablement, organizational links, data science and analytics, and marketing technology. This new focus led to the formation of the company’s first marketing operations and capability functions, the formalization of a branding team, and the integration of its product and performance marketing activities into the team focused on demand generation. Just as important, the work created a clarity of purpose that provided unified and much-needed direction to the company’s marketing staff. As the CMO put it, “It helped us get aligned within our team and with the executive team on what we needed to be best in the world at, what we needed to be good at, and what we could assign to others.” Marketing leaders have recognized and acted on the need to change their organizations. But most have struggled to carry out changes in ways that advance marketing’s operating effectiveness. The framework presented here brings clarity to the process and guides the design of a marketing organization for our time—one built as a coalition to create value and drive company growth.

"112",112,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/innovation-for-impact","strategy.txt","When he was the CEO of SRI International, Curtis Carlson presided over the conception and development of Siri, HDTV, and other groundbreaking innovations. Since then he has shared his approach with more than 500 corporate, university, and government groups. His methodology is based on the principles of active learning, which emphasize concise mental models, the continual iteration of ideas, real-time feedback, teamwork, and frequent comparison of alternatives. Those elements are woven into a process that focuses on customers’ needs, a compelling approach, valuable benefits relative to costs, and superiority to the competition. Innovation in the U.S. is highly inefficient. Despite substantial investment in entrepreneurship—by the government, universities, and the private sector—the per capita rate of job creation from new companies has declined for decades. At its heart, creating value is an exercise in active learning. Unless your process reflects that, your company will probably fail to systematically develop innovations that matter. The author’s framework involves designing an “NABC value proposition” that spells out how your offering addresses customers’ needs with a compelling approach while delivering superior benefits relative to costs and reliably outdoing the competition. The methodology works because it’s based on proven practices from the education sciences. In 1998 I became the CEO of  SRI International, the famous research center that received the first internet transmission, developed the first AI-based robot, launched the personal computing revolution, and created inventions such as the computer mouse, electronic banking, and robotic surgery. In 1998, though, SRI was on its last legs. At my first off-site meeting, a manager stood up and told me we were not going to grow because we couldn’t. We were broke, our facilities urgently needed repair, and the land they sat on was being sold. Teams worked in silos, and most of the senior managers were pursuing their own agendas with little regard for what others were doing.   When I left in 2014, revenue had more than tripled, and world-changing ideas had generated tens of billions of dollars of new marketplace value. By revamping the way employees worked, using a systematic, efficient process for value creation, we reestablished SRI as one of the world’s leading innovation enterprises. The success rate of our projects dramatically improved, and our people gained critical skills that would last a lifetime. In this article I describe the process we used, which enabled us to produce technology such as HDTV and Siri (now on the iPhone). Our methodology is applicable for creating both disruptive and incremental innovations, and versions of it are used in major universities, national laboratories, and large global companies. It works for people in all positions and all professions because value creation is everyone’s job. Since leaving SRI, I have partnered with a former colleague there, Len Polizzotto, to further develop the methodology at Northeastern University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. We call our approach Innovation for Impact, and in 2017 I coauthored a National Academy of Engineering report documenting aspects of the research behind it. What sets our approach apart from others is that we consider value creation to be an exercise in active learning. Coming up with a novel product or service is not simply a matter of waiting for inspiration to strike but a process of using proven practices from the education sciences to gain insights and improve fast. Active learning depends on engagement. Students become master architects, for example, not just by reading textbooks, listening to lectures, or watching other architects but by constantly working on and revising actual projects. Through that activity, they synthesize the theory they’re taught, the techniques they see others using, and their own ability to manage the design process. People who try to learn purely through observation and theory miss a great deal and forget even more. That’s particularly true for anyone seeking to create value in business. Innovation occurs in a complex, dynamic environment; those who succeed do so because they manage to find the right signals in a sea of noise. To create efficiently and effectively in that context, people must follow a structured process that includes five basic elements of active learning: In creative endeavors, repetition is central to learning. Serious piano students, for example, continually practice complex manual maneuvers and experiment with tempo and expression. Those activities are most effective when accompanied by real-time feedback from an expert who can reframe problems and provide potential solutions. Developing a new business idea is, of course, very different from learning to play the piano. The inputs are undefined and may come from a range of sources. So instead of a master-apprentice relationship, the process involves an innovator who keeps refining the idea and seeking feedback widely: from experts, peers, partners, competitors, and, most importantly, customers. Effective feedback initially focuses on arriving at one or two key insights into customer needs and possible solutions. Psychologists assert that all of us construct “mental models”—frameworks carried in our minds to make sense of our experiences and inform our decisions. In active learning, we use these models to identify the beliefs, insights, and assumptions upon which we build hypotheses for what works. We can then test our hypotheses against collected evidence and, if warranted, revise them to develop improved models. It’s critical that the mental models that guide the initial inquiry respect the limitations of the people using them. Research shows that most of us retain only seven items, on average, in our short-term memory. What’s more, we can think about only three or four items at once. If innovators use mental models that are too long or too complicated (as many are), they will not easily make sense of the evidence or rapidly learn their way to better hypotheses. But if mental models are concise, they can, over time, become intrinsic knowledge to be tapped almost automatically. Active learning involves applying a variety of approaches to presenting and experimenting with ideas. Using images, simulations, and prototypes, for example, can bring ideas to life, highlight different aspects of a problem, and challenge people’s thinking about possible solutions. Storytelling is effective because it can create the context for a mental model: Research shows that stories help people remember information and revise their beliefs, assumptions, and theories. Working in teams increases engagement, learning, and motivation. Research suggests that the optimal size for a business team is about five people. That number allows for a diversity of perspectives and skills, is small enough to prevent the group from subdividing, and reduces communication costs and the risks of miscommunication. Because value creation is a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary activity, no individual will have all the necessary knowledge, relevant mental models, or insights. This means that each person on the team must bring the distinct competencies and experiences required for his or her tasks. The goal is to assemble teams whose members have a shared vision but complementary skills and varied viewpoints. Comparison is how we learn our preferences and decide most things, whether we’re buying a new car or choosing what to eat. And research shows that direct and rapid comparison of two similar objects greatly amplifies small differences. Suppose you need new eyeglasses. If you randomly try out different pairs, it may take a while to find one that helps you see better. So instead you get an exam in which you look into a machine that displays lenses of different strengths. Your doctor rapidly switches the lens in front of each eye, asking, “Which is better, this or the previous one?” Having you quickly compare lenses with subtle distinctions enables the doctor to swiftly zero in on the right prescription. Systematic success is achieved when all the building blocks of active learning are brought together in a complete value-creation system. Our approach focuses first on crafting a risk-mitigated value proposition for the offering you hope to bring to market. But how can you tell if you have a good proposition? I once held a workshop for one of the world’s largest companies. The 30 participants were responsible for six initiatives, which they considered to be the firm’s most important ones. I started by asking them to write on sticky notes the company’s definitions for innovation, customer value, and value proposition. After they put all their notes up on a wall, what was obvious was the lack of shared definitions for the most basic concepts of value creation—a problem that was preventing everyone from being fully effective. Palette of Marc Chagall | Photographs: ©Matthias Schaller/Courtesy Sonnabend Gallery, New York/VG Bildkunst 2020 I then gave the teams this instruction: “Write out your initiative’s value proposition on a flip chart. Tell us the customer needs, your approach for the offering, its benefits relative to its costs, and how it compares to the competition.” After half an hour, each team took two minutes to share its statement with the whole group. None was quantitative or convincing, and the teams went back to refine their presentations further. After several iterations, many of the teams found themselves questioning the merits of their initiatives. Some participants were visibly dismayed to realize that they’d been working on things that were interesting to them but of little importance to the company. This is not unusual. My partners and I have held workshops with more than 500 teams from major companies, universities, national laboratories, and government agencies. None has had shared language for the core concepts of innovation, and none has initially been able to address what we regard as the basic components of a value proposition. After we give people a framework, they typically conclude that less than a fourth of their existing projects, if completed, would provide significant value for their enterprises. Our framework is anchored in a fundamental, concise model of what a value proposition should be. We call it the NABC value proposition, and it’s described at length in my book with William Wilmot, Innovation: The Five Disciplines for Creating What Customers Want. An NABC value proposition covers four topics: The innovator’s first task is to draft a value proposition that addresses all four elements. If one is missing, the proposition is incomplete and unlikely to support value creation. The elements are interdependent, which means that altering any one of them will affect some or all of the others. For example, if the customers’ needs change, so will the benefits relative to costs, the competition, and likely the approach. The conciseness of the NABC framework is part of its power. When people use it to evaluate a proposition, they need to think about only four elements. In contrast, overly complex frameworks violate core active-learning principles: The Heilmeier Catechism, for example, poses 11 questions, and the Business Model Canvas has nine sections, each with multiple questions. At SRI we used the NABC model in defining the value proposition for Siri, which we originally conceived as a tool to help with travel arrangements. After it was spun out into a company that was acquired by Steve Jobs, Siri became a general-purpose assistant, but here’s a short version of what we told potential investors early on: People are prone to making three major mistakes in formulating value propositions. First, most people fail to pay adequate attention to their customers’ needs, which should be the foundation of the value proposition. Instead they fall in love with their idea, which means they focus almost exclusively on their approach. Over 95% of the innovation pitches I see are all about approach—a sign that the team has yet to figure out what really matters. If teams avoid this trap and make an effort to look seriously at needs, they typically make a second mistake: over-relying on what customers say they’re seeking, rather than identifying the real need. Consider the first iPhone. Apple’s surveys at the time suggested that people wanted a better keyboard. What they actually wanted was more convenience and ease of use, and that is what the iPhone’s revolutionary touchscreen delivered. Customers can ask only for what they know, and they rarely know what is possible. The third major mistake is related to the other two: It involves spending too much money on an ill-defined approach. If the value proposition is not well-defined, building a minimally viable product wastes time and money. At the start, the smallest possible team should be assembled to address the major risks in the value proposition. Until those risks are mitigated, building the offering is almost always a costly error. Value creation is a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary activity. When an NABC proposition is successful, it is usually because the people formulating it reframe the problem and focus on one or two big ideas that offer potential solutions. Today we’re all used to seeing upside-down ketchup bottles, but initially that design was startling. Bottles traditionally had narrow necks and stood upright to avoid messy leaks, but you had to tip the bottle and pound the bottom to get ketchup out, and you often wound up with more on your plate than you wanted. The solution was obvious once inventor Paul Brown realized that the challenge was not to make a standard bottle that dispensed ketchup better but to make an upside-down bottle that didn’t leak. Value creation begins when someone has an insight about how to solve an unmet need and is motivated to turn that insight into a product or service. I call these people champions because the term captures the spirit of what is required. Anyone at any level of the organization can act as a champion; no particular title or position is necessary. Champions are passionate about their initiatives and persevere. They self-select. You cannot direct people to be value creators; their drive comes from within. At SRI my first question when someone came to see me with an idea was, “Will you be the champion?” If they were new, they might ask what that meant. I would explain: “Champions identify important opportunities, drive the value proposition’s development, learn necessary value-creation skills, build the team, and exemplify positive human values. If you agree to this, let’s get started.” My fundamental rule remains the same: No champion, no project—no exceptions. Once we have an idea and a champion, I ask that person to immediately write down the NABC value proposition and to quantify it instead of using vague terms like bigger, better, faster, or cheaper. If the champion is unsure about something, my advice is “Put down your best estimate.” It will be wrong—that’s always the case at the start—but this first step helps clarify the idea, the core challenges, and the skills to look for when you’re building a team. I then ask the champion to find an “iteration buddy” to drive progress and provide emotional support. My partner for developing HDTV was Glenn Reitmeier. We iterated our value proposition hundreds of times over several years before we identified the key insights that led to the solution. As the value proposition develops, the champion will involve other colleagues, reaching out to people with the expertise to test the value proposition’s assumptions and remove its significant risks. A team will often start with a person with business skills, another with technical expertise, and others who assist part-time with market analysis, technical issues, and operations. The first goal is to minimize risks, not create the product. Value creation forums are recurring meetings where three to six teams—each with up to five members—present value propositions for their initiatives and obtain input from the other participants. A typical forum will bring together 10 to 25 people, with outside experts and partners invited as needed to help participants identify and understand the market, the competition, and the range of potential solutions. At SRI we held separate forums for different aspects of our enterprise—sustaining the core technical-services business, making strategic investments, and creating licenses and new ventures. In all cases we applied the same overall design: A facilitator organizes and moderates the forums, which take place in person or virtually over the web for one to three hours every two to six weeks, depending on the business objectives. Teams sign up to participate and start by attending a two-day workshop to learn the fundamentals of value creation, with the facilitator coaching them on roles and expectations. Once per forum, someone from each team makes an NABC presentation, describing the team’s value proposition in 10 minutes or less. Afterward, the facilitator randomly calls on individuals to answer these questions: The facilitator then asks all participants for any other observations. Finally, someone is asked to evaluate the quality of the feedback. While all this discussion takes place, the presenter stands and listens silently, as a teammate takes notes for review after the meeting. The reason is simple: Presenters may be tempted to defend their presentations rather than listen impartially to the comments, and the meeting may get bogged down in adversarial debate. Thinking about and responding to feedback is work for teams to do later. The forum process makes comparative learning easy because, as already noted, the NABC model enables participants to compare the different value propositions across just four components. And teams benefit not only from the direct feedback they get but also from seeing what other teams do. For example, imagine you work for a drone company that’s seeking to develop new products. Your team’s value proposition identifies a need for a novel drone for bird-watchers and says the overall consumer drone market generates several billion dollars in annual revenue. Other forum participants would probably comment on the lack of specificity about the need and the intended market segment. Although that feedback would be useful, you might remain unsure how to perform better at the next meeting. But suppose another team says this when it presents: “There are 20 million active bird-watchers in America who spend almost $30 billion a year on equipment. Of that total, 1% are hardcore birders who buy the latest equipment and want to capture close-up images and videos of their experiences. The top 5% of spenders in that group of enthusiasts represent a potential market of $15 million a year for ultraquiet, camouflaged, bird-watching drones.” That description of an unmet need, with its additional specificity about potential customers, makes the issues to be addressed more evident. It also sets the bar for other teams’ presentations at the next forum. This is comparative learning at work. When people repeat this process eight or more times in a two-day workshop and then participate in recurring value-creation forums, they see dramatic progress. A good forum needs a good facilitator to manage the schedule and activities, help out when teams get stumped, and add new ideas and clarifications as appropriate. Facilitators are not there to give lectures; their job is to help the teams understand and apply the concepts, reframe issues, and get feedback from their teammates. At SRI we usually put senior staff or executives in that role, choosing people with proven track records at innovation and training them in our methodology. SRI projects went forward if they showed the potential to create significant value—typically a market valuation of $100 million or more for a new venture. That magnitude was necessary to attract top talent, gain the interest of knowledgeable investors, and provide a meaningful financial return. If SRI’s criteria were not met, the project was either abandoned, redirected toward becoming a licensed technology, or rolled into another R&D initiative. At any one time, our venture portfolio consisted of about a dozen projects at various stages of development, with several commercialized each year. We initially made incremental and modest investments, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and focused on establishing the validity of the value proposition. Mid-level management funded the development work at first and then referred promising projects up the organization to gain more support. After an incubation period of up to five years, we would identify an experienced entrepreneur (usually from outside the firm) and assemble a world-class team to take the venture to market. Innovation in the United States is highly inefficient. The per capita rate of job creation from new companies has declined for decades, and only 3% of patents are ever commercialized. Most university tech-transfer and start-up incubators lose money. Venture capitalists look at more than 100 deals to invest in one, and typically less than one in 10 delivers a significant return. Most venture capital firms in fact lose money; 5% earn 95% of the returns. All this despite the efforts of some 220 university entrepreneurial programs, 6,000 professors and instructors teaching entrepreneurship, 1,400 venture incubators, and billions of dollars a year in government investments. We must do better. My experience with SRI and other organizations suggests that basing the value creation process on the principles of active learning and using the structured NABC methodology will deliver the improved innovative outcomes our economy needs and deserves."

Companies should: 1) put Sales at the center of their strategy, 2) leverage Sales to discover and meet new customer needs, 3) improve the sales experience, and 4) not forget to leverage the physical environment while social distancing. It has become clear that we won’t be back to “business as usual” anytime soon. A few months ago, the changes to the workplace brought on by Covid-19 were viewed as a temporary adjustment — something we needed to endure for a few months before the inevitable return to commuting, offices, and face-to-face meetings. But as companies settle into the reality that the current state of things might be the new normal, they need to shift their focus from temporary fixes to a fresh approach to your organizational strategy. For any business that relies on direct sales to drive revenue, it’s time to systematically update your sales organization for the world we’re living in now. Here are four keys to selling more effectively throughout the duration of the pandemic — and beyond. Put sales at the center of your strategy. What changes has your business experienced throughout the pandemic? Have you adapted the way your sales organization goes to market to meet different priorities? Most organizational strategy models either ignore the sales function entirely or only address it peripherally, focusing instead on markets, products and capabilities, initiatives, and so forth. This may have worked well enough in a good economy, but in a tight market, look to your sales function to win business. Sales connects all of your offerings to the market and the sales function is how strategy gets executed. Give sales the tools it needs to succeed by clearly identifying your ideal client profile, detailing the specific reasons clients will choose you over the competition, and getting clear about issues that will likely drive customer decisions. The pandemic has meant for most that there is less business to be won. Yet, this presents an opportunity to rethink not only what you are selling, but how you are selling it as a means to increased revenue, margin, or market share. Leverage Sales to discover and meet new customer needs. Even though the economy has tightened during the pandemic, it doesn’t mean there aren’t new opportunities. Covid-19 has caused lifestyle shifts that have created new markets and sales prospects. For example, across the United States, RV sales have skyrocketed during the pandemic, with sources showing increases of over 600% from previous years. And for most of these customers, buying an RV isn’t a one-off purchase — it represents a new lifestyle which brings even more product lines to the market. RV companies have leveraged these new customer needs by extending their product lines into areas such as camping gear and trendy RV and “van life” interior design options. What new customer needs can your organization address? This is an opportunity to learn about the issues that are driving or reducing the use of your products, determine what additional problems you could help customers solve, and build a strategy to capitalize on and adapt your offerings. Look to your sales organization as the feedback loop to glean insights about your customers’ changing needs. They are, after all, on the front lines and are uniquely positioned to help you understand what customers want now and aren’t getting or, perhaps most importantly, what they are getting from the competition. Applying those insights can be a game changer, not only for driving revenue, but for informing strategic growth decisions on new product and service combinations, the optimization of your manufacturing process, and much more as everyone adapts to long-term Covid-related realities Improve the sales experience. At the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, many organizations adapted by moving sales interactions to videoconference or phone. But the longer-term opportunity is to rethink how to use these platforms to improve, not just sustain, the sales experience — creating value and providing differentiation with prospects and clients to make the whole experience more compelling. To do this, consider new opportunities to help customers recognize issues and identify opportunities they hadn’t considered. With video and phone, it’s easier than ever to involve “Subject Matter Experts,” implementation or customer support staff, and other functions earlier in the sales process to provide deeper expertise and greater insight. Videoconferencing also makes it easier to involve company leaders with customers to address problems and provide higher-level connections and executive sponsorship. In a Fortune 100 technology company I worked with, when there was executive-to-executive level engagement with a client, accounts produced 38% more revenue than those where no executive level relationships existed. Now is the time to rethink how your sales experience can deliver value for potential customers as a key element of your strategy in the Covid-19 world. Design a sales experience that helps customers gain insight about challenges and opportunities created by the virus. For instance, a consumer packaged-goods client of mine created an interactive customer forum aimed at revealing opportunities and trends their clients may be able to capitalize on. Other companies have produced videos for clients to help them think through the implications of the new problems they’re facing. I’ve also attended live Q&A webinars that give potential and existing customers the chance to interact with your company and learn from each other. The switch to remote work and virtual interactions may result in unexpected efficiencies — both in time and resources — that help you improve proactive customer outreach and create a whole new sales and customer experience. A fun example of this happened when my family ordered take-out for dinner from a local Italian restaurant during the height of the pandemic lockdown. Along with our dinner, we received a roll of toilet paper branded with the restaurant’s logo, which was an incredibly valuable and unexpected add-on at that time. When everyone was struggling to find toilet paper in the stores, this restaurant that had an excess of toilet paper because they could not serve dine-in guests, seized on an opportunity to create an exceptional customer service experience. Needless to say, we ordered several more meals from the restaurant in the following weeks! Don’t forget to leverage the physical environment while social distancing. Your sales organization will undoubtedly become more digitally savvy as an outcome of Covid-19, and we’ll continue to discover more tools that can help us connect virtually. But with some thought and a little advance planning, you can leverage the physical world to great effect during your virtual meetings. Any business that deals with tangible products can ship physical samples, models or prototypes to a client, and then follow up with a phone conversation. Even small gestures, such as sending a client a printed copy a document to save them from having to use their home printer, can be a way to connect in the physical world. Additionally, while you may not be able to meet up with clients in person, you can still recreate some of the physical environment you’re missing out on. Send a bag of gourmet coffee to a prospect and schedule a conversation over a cup of coffee (and they’ll have gourmet coffee for a week!). Or have a nice lunch delivered toward the end of your videoconference to recreate the enjoyment of getting together at a restaurant. I have a client who invited a group of prospects to a virtual wine tasting, sent three bottles to arrive the day before, and had a sommelier lead a 30-minute tasting by videoconference. It’s often about being thoughtful and reallocating a portion of your travel and expense dollars creatively. *** Facing the disruptions caused by Covid-19 continues to be a challenge, but it can provide unexpected opportunities to drive a better sales process with prospects and customers. With thoughtful modifications, planning and some imagination, your sales strategy, sales experience, and customer interactions can emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever.

"114",114,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/startups-its-time-to-think-like-camels-not-unicorns","strategy.txt","Covid-19 and the global recession it has caused have us all girding for a long period of extremely challenging conditions in the global market. This situation is uncharted waters for the traditional Silicon Valley startup model, which is geared toward fast growth and creating “unicorns.” Instead of the unicorn, the camel is the more fitting mascot. Camels can survive for long periods in extremely adverse conditions. Startup camel enterprises offer businesses in all industries and sectors valuable lessons on how to survive and grow in adverse conditions. They do this with three strategies in mind: they execute balanced growth; they take a long-term outlook; and they weave diversification into the business model. The world has changed. In the wake of Covid-19, and the global recession it has caused, business leaders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and investors are all girding for a long period of extremely challenging conditions in the global market. How can startups and innovators of all stripes survive in such conditions? Many are not prepared. The current situation is particularly difficult for Silicon Valley, where the predominant model is to raise unicorns – the colloquial reference to startups worth over a billion dollars. Traditionally, this is done through rapid growth. The problem now, however, is that this growth-at-all-costs methodology, which the Valley’s top players are exceptionally good at, only works in the strongest bull markets, in the most optimal conditions. But consider what I call the “Frontier”: those business ecosystems outside the Bay Area bubble, where startups have less access to capital or trained startup human capital, and where, especially in many emerging markets, they are more susceptible to severe and unpredictable macroeconomic shocks. Instead of the unicorn, the camel is the more fitting mascot. Camels are able to survive for long periods without sustenance, withstand the scorching desert heat, and adapt to extreme variations in climate. They survive and thrive in some of Earth’s harshest regions. These startup camels offer businesses in all industries and sectors valuable lessons on how to survive through crisis, and to sustain and grow in adverse conditions, even if the metaphor isn’t as flashy. They do this with three strategies: they execute balanced growth, they take a long-term outlook, and they weave diversification into the business model. Camels have no interest in “blitzscaling” — rapidly building-up the enterprise and prioritizing speed over efficiency in pursuit of massive scale. They are as ambitious to grow as any Silicon Valley enterprise, yet they take a more balanced growth path. This balanced approach has three key elements. Right-pricing from the start. For one, entrepreneurs in developing markets don’t offer free or subsidized products to perpetuate customer growth, resulting in a high “burn rate.” Instead, they charge their customers for the value of their product offerings from the get-go. Camels understand that price shouldn’t be considered a barrier to growth. Instead it is a feature of the product that reflects its market position and its quality. Cost management through the life cycle. At the same time, camels manage costs through the life cycle of their companies to align with a longer-term growth curve. Matt Glotzbach, CEO of Quizlet, an online education and study aid company, understands this strategy in terms of his cost of acquisition and his key expense: people. “You want to have a business that can survive the ups and the downs,” he explains. “Resiliency for me has two factors: one is the unit economics of the business for user acquisition, and the second is how far do you invest in headcount ahead of the revenue curve to drive that growth? This is where we make calculated decisions and have expectations for the investments where, if we’re right, we grow significantly, and if we’re wrong we won’t suffer significantly.” Changing the trajectory. Managing burn throughout the life cycle of a company prepares startups to weather tough conditions over a sustained period. The typical Silicon Valley startup has a cash trajectory with a deep “valley of death” — the graph line reflecting steep losses before profitability is achieved. The line for Frontier startups looks different. Of course camels don’t avoid growth or venture capital funding, but their scaling trajectory and associated burn rates will be less extreme. In some cases, as with Grubhub, they’ll grow in controlled spurts, choosing only to put their foot on the gas and invest (often by raising venture capital) when required by the opportunity at hand. After such a spurt, sustainability (and often profitability) is within reach again if necessary. The difference here is that camels maintain the option to adapt their growth trajectory and return to a sustainable business. Founders at the Frontier understand that building a company is not a short-term endeavor. For many, breakthroughs don’t come immediately, but rather occur later in the company timeline. Survival is often the primary strategy. This allows time to build the business model, find a product that resonates with the market, and develop an operation that can scale. Competition will exist. But the race is about who will survive the longest, not about who goes to market first. Quizlet just raised a $30 million Series C round, which valued the company at $1 billion in May of this year. The company did not take any funding until 2015, when it raised a Series A for just $12 million after 10 years in business. It took its time getting there, operating on a slow-but-steady philosophy toward growth. Glotzbach told me that Quizlet’s pace saved it from destruction. “I actually believe that had Quizlet raised a large amount of money earlier in its life cycle it may not have made it,” he said. “The risk of getting overextended with high expectations and the infusion of capital earlier on might not have been able to accelerate the business fast enough to meet those expectations. Like so many startups we would have over-promised and under-delivered.” Taking the long-term outlook is critical to manage the risk-return trade-off. Entrepreneurs operating at the Frontier face unique constraints which can often become strengths during times of adversity. Because entrepreneurs often are building startups in smaller markets by necessity — which markets are not sufficient on their own to grow and sustain the enterprise — they are forced to be born global, targeting many markets from the get-go. Frontier Car Group, a popular used-car platform, for example, launched originally in five markets, each serving as a regional hub. In some countries, the product caught on, but in others it did not, and the company learned valuable lessons along the way, shuttering those markets where it didn’t see a fit. But had the company put all of its resources into the wrong country to begin with, it might not be around today. Similarly, because a rich tapestry of enabling infrastructure or ecosystem of adjacent products and services doesn’t exist in Frontier markets, entrepreneurs often need to go deep and build the full stack of supporting structures. This means that they have multiple business lines and products, and provide an ecosystem of services from day one. When one slows, the others pick up the slack. Take the case of Guiabolso, a “Personal Finance Manager” software platform that helps customers in Brazil understand their financial situation so they can manage it better (similar to Mint.com in the U.S.). Unlike their peers in more developed ecosystems, Guiabolso had to build their own bank interconnection layer where none existed, give insight into credit worthiness without a robust national credit scoring infrastructure, and kick-start its product marketplace to allow its customers to make the most of their newfound financial insights. Of course, entrepreneurs cannot and should not take this broad and deep portfolio strategy too far. Building a startup is exceedingly difficult, and overstretching across multiple fronts is a recipe for mediocrity on all. Instead, successful camels only expend resources on activities that are self-reinforcing (where lessons from successes or failures support the business as a whole) and self-balancing (when one piece of the business naturally hedges another). By prioritizing balanced growth, building for the long-term, as well as deepening and diversifying for resilience, camels can not only survive market shocks, but can also grow and thrive in good times and bad. In short, they turn adversity into an advantage. As we prepare for the tough challenges ahead, the answers won’t be found within Silicon Valley’s insular bubble, but by learning from camels at the Frontier, who have had the solution all along.

"115",115,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/a-practical-guide-to-building-ethical-ai","strategy.txt","Companies are quickly learning that AI doesn’t just scale solutions — it also scales risk. In this environment, data and AI ethics are business necessities, not academic curiosities. Companies need a clear plan to deal with the ethical quandaries this new tech is introducing. To operationalize data and AI ethics, they should: 1) Identify existing infrastructure that a data and AI ethics program can leverage; 2) Create a data and AI ethical risk framework that is tailored to your industry; 3) Change how you think about ethics by taking cues from the successes in health care; 4) Optimize guidance and tools for product managers; 5) Build organizational awareness; 6) Formally and informally incentivize employees to play a role in identifying AI ethical risks; and 7) Monitor impacts and engage stakeholders. Companies are leveraging data and artificial intelligence to create scalable solutions — but they’re also scaling their reputational, regulatory, and legal risks. For instance, Los Angeles is suing IBM for allegedly misappropriating data it collected with its ubiquitous weather app. Optum is being investigated by regulators for creating an algorithm that allegedly recommended that doctors and nurses pay more attention to white patients than to sicker black patients. Goldman Sachs is being investigated by regulators for using an AI algorithm that allegedly discriminated against women by granting larger credit limits to men than women on their Apple cards. Facebook infamously granted Cambridge Analytica, a political firm, access to the personal data of more than 50 million users. Just a few years ago discussions of “data ethics” and “AI ethics” were reserved for nonprofit organizations and academics. Today the biggest tech companies in the world — Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and more — are putting together fast-growing teams to tackle the ethical problems that arise from the widespread collection, analysis, and use of massive troves of data, particularly when that data is used to train machine learning models, aka AI. These companies are investing in answers to once esoteric ethical questions because they’ve realized one simple truth: failing to operationalize data and AI ethics is a threat to the bottom line. Missing the mark can expose companies to reputational, regulatory, and legal risks, but that’s not the half of it. Failing to operationalize data and AI ethics leads to wasted resources, inefficiencies in product development and deployment, and even an inability to use data to train AI models at all. For example, Amazon engineers reportedly spent years working on AI hiring software, but eventually scrapped the program because they couldn’t figure out how to create a model that doesn’t systematically discriminate against women. Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google, faced massive backlash by citizens and local government officials over their plans to build an IoT-fueled “smart city” within Toronto due to a lack of clear ethical standards for the project’s data handling. The company ultimately scrapped the project at a loss of two years of work and USD $50 million. Despite the costs of getting it wrong, most companies grapple with data and AI ethics through ad-hoc discussions on a per-product basis. With no clear protocol in place on how to identify, evaluate, and mitigate the risks, teams end up either overlooking risks, scrambling to solve issues as they come up, or crossing their fingers in the hope that the problem will resolve itself. When companies have attempted to tackle the issue at scale, they’ve tended to implement strict, imprecise, and overly broad policies that lead to false positives in risk identification and stymied production. These problems grow by orders of magnitude when you introduce third-party vendors, who may or may not be thinking about these questions at all. Companies need a plan for mitigating risk — how to use data and develop AI products without falling into ethical pitfalls along the way. Just like other risk-management strategies, an operationalized approach to data and AI ethics must systematically and exhaustively identify ethical risks throughout the organization, from IT to HR to marketing to product and beyond. Putting the larger tech companies to the side, there are three standard approaches to data and AI ethical risk mitigation, none of which bear fruit. First, there is the academic approach. Academics — and I speak from 15 years of experience as a former professor of philosophy — are fantastic at rigorous and systematic inquiry. Those academics who are ethicists (typically found in philosophy departments) are adept at spotting ethical problems, their sources, and how to think through them. But while academic ethicists might seem like a perfect match, given the need for systematic identification and mitigation of ethical risks, they unfortunately tend to ask different questions than businesses. For the most part, academics ask, “Should we do this? Would it be good for society overall? Does it conduce to human flourishing?” Businesses, on the other hand, tend to ask, “Given that we are going to do this, how can we do it without making ourselves vulnerable to ethical risks?” The result is academic treatments that do not speak to the highly particular, concrete uses of data and AI. This translates to the absence of clear directives to the developers on the ground and the senior leaders who need to identify and choose among a set of risk mitigation strategies. Next, is the “on-the-ground” approach. Within businesses those asking the questions are standardly enthusiastic engineers, data scientists, and product managers. They know to ask the business-relevant risk-related questions precisely because they are the ones making the products to achieve particular business goals. What they lack, however, is the kind of training that academics receive. As a result, they do not have the skill, knowledge, and experience to answer ethical questions systematically, exhaustively, and efficiently. They also lack a critical ingredient: institutional support. Finally, there are companies (not to mention countries) rolling out high-level AI ethics principles. Google and Microsoft, for instance, trumpeted their principles years ago. The difficulty comes in operationalizing those principles. What, exactly, does it mean to be for “fairness?” What are engineers to do when confronted with the dozens of definitions and accompanying metrics for fairness in the computer science literature? Which metric is the right one in any given case, and who makes that judgment? For most companies — including those tech companies who are actively trying to solve the problem — there are no clear answers to these questions. Indeed, seeming coalescence around a shared set of abstract values actually obscures widespread misalignment. AI ethics does not come in a box. Given the varying values of companies across dozens of industries, a data and AI ethics program must be tailored to the specific business and regulatory needs that are relevant to the company. However, here are seven steps towards building a customized, operationalized, scalable, and sustainable data and AI ethics program. 1. Identify existing infrastructure that a data and AI ethics program can leverage. The key to a successful creation of a data and AI ethics program is using the power and authority of existing infrastructure, such as a data governance board that convenes to discuss privacy, cyber, compliance, and other data-related risks. This allows concerns from those “on the ground” (e.g., product owners and managers) to bubble up and, when necessary, they can in turn elevate key concerns to relevant executives. Governance board buy in works for a few reasons: 1) the executive level sets the tone for how seriously employees will take these issues, 2) a data and AI ethics strategy needs to dovetail with the general data and AI strategy, which is devised at the executive level, and 3) protecting the brand from reputational, regulatory, and legal risk is ultimately a C-suite responsibility, and they need to be alerted when high stakes issues arise. If such a body does not exist then companies can create one — an ethics council or committee, for example — with ethics-adjacent personnel, such as those in cyber, risk and compliance, privacy, and analytics. It may also be advisable to include external subject matter experts, including ethicists. 2. Create a data and AI ethical risk framework that is tailored to your industry. A good framework comprises, at a minimum, an articulation of the ethical standards — including the ethical nightmares — of the company, an identification of the relevant external and internal stakeholders, a recommended governance structure, and an articulation of how that structure will be maintained in the face of changing personnel and circumstances. It is important to establish KPIs and a quality assurance program to measure the continued effectiveness of the tactics carrying out your strategy. A robust framework also makes clear how ethical risk mitigation is built into operations. For instance, it should identify the ethical standards data collectors, product developers, and product managers and owners must adhere to. It should also articulate a clear process by which ethical concerns are elevated to more senior leadership or to an ethics committee. All companies should ask whether there are processes in place that vet for biased algorithms, privacy violations, and unexplainable outputs. Still, frameworks also need to be tailored to a company’s industry. In finance, it is important to think about how digital identities are determined and how international transactions can be ethically safe. In health care there will need to be extra protections built around privacy, particularly as AI enables the development of precision medicine. In the retail space, where recommendation engines loom large, it is important to develop methods to detect and mitigate associative bias, where recommendations flow from stereotypical and sometimes offensive associations with various populations. 3. Change how you think about ethics by taking cues from the successes in health care. Many senior leaders describe ethics in general — and data and AI ethics in particular — as “squishy” or “fuzzy,” and argue it is not sufficiently “concrete” to be actionable. Leaders should take inspiration from health care, an industry that has been systematically focused on ethical risk mitigation since at least the 1970s. Key concerns about what constitutes privacy, self-determination, and informed consent, for example, have been explored deeply by medical ethicists, health care practitioners, regulators, and lawyers. Those insights can be transferred to many ethical dilemmas around consumer data privacy and control. For instance, companies attest to respect the users of their products, but what does that mean in practice? In health care, an essential requirement of demonstrating respect for patients is that they are treated only after granting their informed consent — understood to include consent that, at a minimum, does not result from lies, manipulation, or communications in words the patient cannot understand, such as impenetrable legalese or Latin medical terms. These same kinds of requirements can be brought to bear on how people’s data is collected, used, and shared. Ensuring that users are not only informed of how their data is being used, but also that they are informed early on and in a way that makes comprehension likely (for instance, by not burying the information in a long legal document), is one easy lesson to take from health care. The more general lesson is to break down big ethical concepts like privacy, bias, and explainability into infrastructure, process, and practice that realize those values. 4. Optimize guidance and tools for product managers. While your framework provides high-level guidance, it’s essential that guidance at the product level is granular. Take, for instance, the oft-lauded value of explainability in AI, a highly valued feature of ML models that will likely be part of your framework. Standard machine-learning algorithms engage in pattern recognition too unwieldy for humans to grasp. But it is common — particularly when the outputs of the AI are potentially life-altering — to want or demand explanations for AI outputs. The problem is that there is often a tension between making outputs explainable, on the one hand, and making the outputs (e.g. predictions) accurate, on the other. Product managers need to know how to make that tradeoff, and customized tools should be developed to help product managers make those decisions. For example, companies can create a tool by which project managers can evaluate the importance of explainability for a given product. If explainability is desirable because it helps to ferret out bias in an algorithm, but biased outputs are not a concern for this particular ML application, then that downgrades the importance of explainability relative to accuracy. If the outputs fall under regulations that require explanations — for instance, regulations in the banking industry that require banks to explain why someone has been turned down for a loan — then explainability will be imperative. The same goes for other relevant values, e.g. which, if any, of the dozens of metrics to use when determining whether a product delivers fair or equitable outputs. 5. Build organizational awareness. Ten years ago, corporations scarcely paid attention to cyber risks, but they certainly do now, and employees are expected to have a grasp of some of those risks. Anyone who touches data or AI products — be they in HR, marketing, or operations — should understand the company’s data and AI ethics framework. Creating a culture in which a data and AI ethics strategy can be successfully deployed and maintained requires educating and upskilling employees, and empowering them to raise important questions at crucial junctures and raise key concerns to the appropriate deliberative body. Throughout this process, it’s important to clearly articulate why data and AI ethics matters to the organization in a way that demonstrates the commitment is not merely part of a public relations campaign. 6. Formally and informally incentivize employees to play a role in identifying AI ethical risks. As we’ve learned from numerous infamous examples, ethical standards are compromised when people are financially incentivized to act unethically. Similarly, failing to financially incentivize ethical actions can lead to them being deprioritized. A company’s values are partly determined by how it directs financial resources. When employees don’t see a budget behind scaling and maintaining a strong data and AI ethics program, they will turn their attention to what moves them forward in their career. Rewarding people for their efforts in promoting a data ethics program is essential. 7. Monitor impacts and engage stakeholders. Creating organizational awareness, ethics committees, informed product managers owners, engineers, and data collectors is all part of the development and, ideally, procurement process. But due to limited resources, time, and a general failure to imagine all the ways things can go wrong, it is important to monitor the impacts of the data and AI products that are on the market. A car can be built with air bags and crumple zones, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe to drive it at 100 mph down a side street. Similarly, AI products can be ethically developed but unethically deployed. There is both qualitative and quantitative research to be done here, including especially engaging stakeholders to determine how the product has affected them. Indeed, in the ideal scenario, relevant stakeholders are identified early in the development process and incorporated into an articulation of what the product does and does not do. Operationalizing data and AI ethics is not an easy task. It requires buy-in from senior leadership and cross-functional collaboration. Companies that make the investment, however, will not only see mitigated risk but also more efficient adoption of the technologies they need to forge ahead. And finally, they’ll be exactly what their clients, consumers, and employees are looking for: trustworthy."
"116",116,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/when-business-as-usual-isnt-working-look-to-nonprofits-for-inspiration","strategy.txt","The business world can learn a lot from nonprofits, especially in a moment when it’s being asked to be more inclusive, more considerate of social impact, and to make do with fewer resources. There are three interrelated strategies that are relevant to businesses seeking to add societal value in the Covid era: 1) pursue intermediate goals; 2) embrace seemingly contradictory tensions; and 3) do more with less. The Christian Medical College (CMC) Hospital in Vellore, India, is a good model for how to put the ideas into practice. To achieve its longterm goal of better health care outcomes, CMC pursued an intermediate jobs program that dealt with people’s immediate felt need — more stable income — and built trust with the hospital. While CMC’s goal of providing high-quality care to low-income patients seems contradictory, its good reputation allowed it to charge wealthier patients more and subsidize those in need. Discerning which expenses add value prudently and which don’t allowed CMC to keep costs relatively low. The strategies of embracing obliquity, paradoxicality, and frugality are not novel in and of themselves, but applying them in a mutually reinforcing way creates new possibilities. In the Covid-era, businesses must — and will — play an essential role in dealing with the hardships created by the pandemic. But to do so, they must also recognize how the ground has shifted under them: Inclusivity is more important than ever; there’s pressure on leaders to weigh social outcomes, as well as economic ones; and resources for achieving all of this are scarcer than usual. Existing approaches may not be sufficient to meet the challenge. The business world would do well to look to nonprofits for fresh ideas. As management legend Peter Drucker noted, nonprofits can be an unorthodox but powerful source of inspiration for business. This seems especially true in the wake of Covid-19, as key stakeholders and customers face economic distress — a situation which many nonprofits routinely deal with. I was reminded of this during the early days pandemic, when travel restrictions prevented me from returning to China and I found myself stuck in my hometown of Vellore, India — which also happens to be the headquarters for the Christian Medical College (CMC) Hospital, whose pioneering medical work over several decades has greatly improved local citizens’ well-being. It has provided high-quality care in communities with severe constraints on affordability, and its efforts have been so successful that Bill Gates, whose foundation has supported CMC, singled out the Vellore region as an exemplar of outstanding public health outcomes. Founded in 1900 by Dr. Ida S. Scudder, to compassionately serve local women and children in need, it has grown into a large multi-specialty hospital with a top-ranked medical college, and has spawned, inspired, or otherwise influenced an ecosystem of nonprofits in Vellore covering areas as diverse as leprosy, counseling and community education. Along the way, CMC has become a pioneer in community health. What makes CMC’s work particularly relevant to business leaders, though, is how it has succeeded within the constraints of dealing with 1) a complex process of inclusivity in a society with high levels of gender, caste, and economic inequality, 2) a tension between maintaining a high quality of service and affordability, and 3) severe resource constraints as a nonprofit organization. After interviewing various current and retired leaders, faculty and associates of CMC — in particular, its Community Health and Development (CHAD) department — I identified three interrelated strategies that are relevant to businesses seeking to add societal value in the Covid era: 1) pursue intermediate goals; 2) embrace seemingly contradictory tensions; and 3) do more with less. The key to CMC’s community health success lies in the interconnectedness of these strategies, rather than on any single factor in isolation. A key lesson from CMC’s experience is that it may be necessary to pursue an intermediate goal in order to address your ultimate goal — what British economist John Kay called the “obliquity” principle. In CMC’s context, the obliquity principle meant that in order to get villagers to engage in health interventions, the felt need of the village communities for jobs and paychecks had to be addressed first. This required skillful engagement with stakeholders. Dr. Abraham Joseph, who spearheaded CHAD’s development for three decades, had to convince the parent hospital and medical college that a jobs program served the hospital’s goals, and get the buy-in of external stakeholders, such as the village elders and local government, without whom the interventions would fail. With stakeholder buy-in, CHAD introduced skill-development programs (e.g., in masonry, welding, and weaving) and economic opportunities improved. This oblique approach made eminent sense: Immunization and maternal-care programs could be more effective if communities’ socioeconomic needs were also met. Applying this to the business world, companies could offer capability-upgrading support to small and medium-sized (SME) suppliers, as an intermediate goal that meets the other’s felt needs, which in turn will help them to operate effectively. When seeking to offer inclusive solutions, organizations must inevitably deal with the tension between economic or technical considerations that they ought not compromise on and the reality that constituents’ affordability is limited. While it may seem that there’s no way to satisfy both, setting up a choice between the two, embracing the paradoxicality of “both/and leadership” — as opposed to an “either/or” mindset — can help organizations navigate this challenge. For CMC, the tension was between the need to be effective through high standards of rigor and also affordable to the poor. But University of Michigan professor C.K. Prahalad, who studied CMC in the early 1970s, noted that this dual imperative of “dedication to excellence and commitment to service” actually offered a solution: The high quality of care allowed CMC to charge wealthier patients enough to subsidize those who couldn’t pay. Prahalad quotes a senior doctor in his case study: “the principle reason for maintaining paying wards … is to earn money with which to give free treatment of high technical, human and ethical quality to poorer patients.” For businesses in a post-Covid world, embracing tensions might involve being less obsessed with beating rivals and more preoccupied with promoting brand values promoting high quality and greater inclusivity of services to address the wider community. This could take on forms such as rivals collaborating to accelerate the discovery of health care cures, or offering affordable business services and tools so that small business can continue to operate, as in the case of the Australian Information Industry Association’s (AIIA) business continuity initiative. Making excellence-with-affordability sustainable requires buy-in from stakeholders like the faculty and staff to adhere to certain core values — such as frugality, as discussed next. Inevitably, a major challenge associated with offering inclusive solutions is that of operating in a resource-constrained environment, which calls for ingenuity in making the available means go as far as possible. To excel in that environment, it’s essential to discern what adds value prudently and what doesn’t. The ability to do more with less enabled CMC’s CHAD to provide high-quality service in communities with severe constraints on affordability. Indeed, a principle of austerity permeates the entire organization. As Dr. Sunil Chandy, a former director of CMC Hospital observes, “Frills in external appearances, high-cost low-value additions are very carefully considered…Great care is taken to ensure an ambience of comfort without over-expenditure.” This emphasis on frugality leads to enterprising efforts to tap external resources; in CHAD’s case this included NGOs like Christian Aid in the UK that supported the socioeconomic development activity, thus alleviating the financial burden. Furthermore, frugality can also be a trigger for creativity leading to new ways to overcome resource constraints. One of CHAD’s early innovations was the identification and training of semiliterate rural women as part-time community health workers (PTCHWs) – with echoes of China’s barefoot doctors. Thus the strategy of pursuing socioeconomic development alongside health outcomes was feasible because of budgetary conservatism combined with creativity. IIM Bangalore’s Rishikesha Krishnan observes, “Fired by missionary zeal, hospitals like CMC Vellore offer outstanding health care at low cost through a combination of austerity and appropriateness.” While not all managers in for-profits will share the mindset of nonprofit professionals who are willing to work for modest salaries, they could explore how to offer parallel lines of low-cost variants or simplify their core offerings to enhance affordability for market segments that have been particularly hard hit by the economic fallout of Covid-19. Opting for lesser frills without sacrificing too much of an offering’s core efficacy — which may entail some ingenuity such as converting scuba diving masks to ventilators in Italy — can ensure that cash-strapped buyers aren’t excluded from the marketplace and has the virtue of potentially retaining customers for businesses. *** The strategies of embracing obliquity, paradoxicality, and frugality are not novel in and of themselves, but when applied in a mutually reinforcing way, as CMC’s CHAD has done, inclusive services can be delivered to the economically challenged. A common thread relates to building and leveraging network relationships — in particular, stakeholder collaboration. In CHAD’s case, women who participated in the socioeconomic activities became a “bridge” with a credible voice that helped increase the appeal of the health program to the rural community, and strengthened the work of the existing part-time community health workers, ultimately delivering the sort of outcomes that got the attention of Bill Gates. For-profit businesses can draw inspiration from CMC on how to be compassionate while the world economy rebuilds, and perhaps emerge stronger and more focused as a result."
"117",117,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/you-dont-have-to-pivot-in-a-crisis","strategy.txt","Conventional wisdom says that the smart move when a crisis hits is to pivot quickly and decisively. But pivoting isn’t always the right move for every company. The authors look at the stories of three companies who opted to stay the course when the Covid-19 pandemic hit and why the decision worked for them. They identify a set of rules that the “stay-the-course” companies followed: slow down, reaffirm your thesis, trim around the edges, watch the data, and test for weakness — and if you do have to pivot, do it explosively. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. When Covid-19 burst upon the scene in early 2020, startup ventures faced dramatic shifts in markets and the importance of strategic agility became axiomatic: If you wanted your venture to survive, let alone thrive, pundits (including ourselves) almost universally advocated deep internal cuts accompanied by pivots to new markets and business models. As the leadership of the tech-focused California VC firm Sequoia Capital wrote in a March Medium post identifying Covid-19 as the black swan of 2020, “Nobody ever regrets making fast and decisive adjustments to changing circumstances.” However, ventures we know well through our investment portfolio (Isenberg is a minor (<1%) shareholder in Guesty, X24 Factory, and Camp) and network — many well-funded startups in hard hit industries such as hospitality, travel, and furniture — shunned strategic agility (changing product-market fit) for stability and resolutely stayed the course with only minor tweaks. Examples include: Despite the turmoil in their markets, TravelPerk, X24 Factory, and Guesty all made the conscious decision to not pivot and deliberately maintained their strategies, their business models, and their teams with only marginal changes. However, staying the course doesn’t mean inaction. Across the observed portfolio of ventures, we found some commonalities, a set of rules that the “stay-the-course” companies followed: slow down, reaffirm your thesis, trim around the edges, watch the data, and test for weakness — and if you do have to pivot, do it explosively. Immediately slow down. Entrepreneurs tend to run at breakneck speed — these companies were no exception. However, when their markets started to melt down, rather than slamming on the brakes, they downshifted in order to listen to customers, track the market, conserve resources, and enhance their ability to change direction if needed. There is an analog in the animal world: The cheetah, the world’s fastest land animal, pursues its prey at just half speed, rarely reaching even close to its 70 miles per hour limit. Scientists believe that this strategy allows the cheetah to save its strength and preserve optionality by not over-committing to a wrong direction as its prey suddenly shifts. These companies followed a similar logic. As Avi Meir, co-founding CEO of TravelPerk, put it, “We slowed down decision making because it was a wartime scenario with little information, and the worst thing would have been to run amuck.” Meir wanted to keep his and his team’s eyes sharply focused on TravelPerk’s long-term vision and avoid making rash decisions that might compromise that vision. Take time to reaffirm your basic thesis. Slowing down also allowed these entrepreneurs to make double sure that their view of their future marketplace was still valid. Amiad Soto, co-founding CEO of Guesty, engaged his board and executive team to look a few months out; he concluded that Guesty’s fundamentals had not changed one bit: “During the pandemic, people still seek vacation rentals, even though the specific patterns might change: In addition to cleanliness and safety being paramount, we concluded that vacation and short term rentals would become longer and demand would increase. We are in the business of helping/ensuring property management companies thrive, and that did not change for us,” reflected Soto. Meir saw additional benefits to TravelPerk staying true to its initial vision: “We saw our better-resourced competitors acting too fast.” As competitors rushed into major layoffs, TravelPerk picked up many of their corporate customers “because we kept our sales and service capacity intact while they rashly cut costs,” commented Meir. Meir felt comfortable continuing to invest in staff because he was confident that the company’s core thesis remained the same. Trim fat, not muscle. Part of slowing down is trimming operations, but only around the margins. This is counter to the now-conventional wisdom of crisis-driven cutting into the muscle by reducing payroll faster and deeper than you think is necessary. Yes, take advantage of the fall in prices to renegotiate rental leases and supplier contracts, but consider making only marginal cuts in payroll expenses, primarily through performance management rather than layoffs or furloughs. As Meir reflected, “We cut fat, not muscle or bone like our competitors,” preserving TravelPerk’s strength and flexibility. Watch new data like a hawk. Within days of the lockdowns starting, X24 Factory saw demand for furniture plummet by 40%, according to founding CEO Miro Morczinek. “But rather than overreact, we first started looking at all kinds of new data. We looked at Italy to see how their worst-case scenario might apply to our major market in Germany. We looked at job searches to see where the layoffs were happening in our supply chain. We studied other verticals such as cars and travel to see how they were being impacted.” At first, this seemed to Morczinek like a replay of the 2008 recession, but after setting up an hourly data watch, “On the second weekend after lockdown, our intense monitoring showed a surprising explosion in demand.” It emerged that the lockdown was allowing people to accelerate home improvement projects and pushing them to move living space outdoors – garden furniture more than compensated for losses in other categories, and in response, “We only tweaked our messaging.” Test for weaknesses and prepare internally. Companies should apply increased scrutiny not only to the marketplace, but also to their own internal points of failure. You can stay the course only if you stay ahead of the organizational disruption that external shocks can cause. “On March 11, I conducted a surprise ‘fire drill’ by requiring everyone to work from home in order to learn what our weaknesses were,” recalled TravelPerk’s Meir. Remote work was unprecedented at the venture, and they quickly identified problems — home offices with no air conditioning so windows had to stay open to noisy streets below, poor internet connections, and the lack of desk chairs. Meir created a team to resolve these issues and completed equipping 500 home offices on the weekend Spain locked down the entire country. If and when you do pivot, consider doing it explosively. Back to our cheetah. In addition to holding the mammalian speed record, the cheetah is also the champion of redirecting its body — they change speed and direction better than trained polo horses and accelerate faster than racetrack greyhounds. When a cheetah does change direction, it does so with unparalleled decisiveness and commitment, digging its non-retractable claws in while wrenching its lithe physique towards its prey. In-store retailers have been crushed by Covid-19, but Ben Kaufman, co-founding CEO of the retail family experience startup Camp, pivoted like a cheetah. Anticipating in February that sheltering-in-place would soon reach the U.S., by mid-March Kaufman had shuttered all five of Camp’s new, high end “family experience stores” and furloughed 130 retail staff. Following just days of intense discussions, Kaufman and Amanda Raposo, Camp’s chief experience officer, started bringing their entire in-store family experience into the home, first launching Camp’s Zoom birthday parties, which within a few months were contributing (along with other new digital products) to the revenues that surpassed pre-pandemic forecasts. Camp went on to cut major deals with Walmart and other retailers to imbue their brands with Camp’s unique online family engagement. Methodically not-pivoting can pay off — in the right situation, that is. Staying the course, with minor adjustments, has proved to be a winning strategy for these ventures: “For the first time since founding, X24 Factory is significantly profitable,” commented X24 Factory’s Morczinek. TravelPerk is adding new customers and winning market share, and in fact exceeded its July forecast by 100%. Guesty is seeing significant increases in longer-term rentals. The lesson here is that when a crisis hits, it pays to resist knee-jerk reactions on how to handle external shocks and ask what is going to work best for your company, based on the particular realities of its business. Ignoring the playbook of rapid cuts plus strategic pivoting can be the smart move. If our content helps you to contend with coronavirus and other challenges, please consider subscribing to HBR.

"118",118,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/are-you-ready-for-the-quantum-computing-revolution","strategy.txt","The quantum race is already underway. Governments and private investors all around the world are pouring billions of dollars into quantum research and development. Satellite-based quantum key distribution for encryption has been demonstrated, laying the groundwork for a potential quantum security-based global communication network. IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other companies are investing heavily in developing large-scale quantum computing hardware and software.  Nobody is quite there yet. Even so, business leaders should consider developing strategies to address three main areas: 1.) planning for quantum security, 2.) indentifying use cases for quantum computing, and 3.) thinking through responsible design. By planning responsibly, while also embracing future uncertainty, businesses can improve their odds of being ready for the quantum future. Quantum physics has already changed our lives. Thanks to the invention of the laser and the transistor — both products of quantum theory — almost every electronic device we use today is an example of quantum physics in action. We may now be on the brink of a second quantum revolution as we attempt to harness even more of the power of the quantum world. Quantum computing and quantum communication could impact many sectors, including healthcare, energy, finance, security, and entertainment. Recent studies predict a multibillion-dollar quantum industry by 2030. However, significant practical challenges need to be overcome before this level of large-scale impact is achievable. Although quantum theory is over a century old, the current quantum revolution is based on the more recent realization that uncertainty — a fundamental property of quantum particles — can be a powerful resource. At the level of individual quantum particles, such as electrons or photons (particles of light), it’s impossible to precisely know every property of the particle at any given moment in time. For example, the GPS in your car can tell you your location and your speed and direction all at once, and precisely enough to get you to your destination. But a quantum GPS could not simultaneously and precisely display all those properties of an electron, not because of faulty design, but because the laws of quantum physics forbid it. In the quantum world, we must use the language of probability, rather than certainty. And in the context of computing based on binary digits (bits) of 0s and 1s, this means that quantum bits (qubits) have some likelihood of being a 1 and some likelihood of being 0 at the same time. Such imprecision is at first disconcerting. In our everyday classical computers, 0’s and 1’s are associated with switches and electronic circuits turning on and off. Not knowing if they are exactly on or off wouldn’t make much sense from a computing point of view. In fact, that would lead to errors in calculations. But the revolutionary idea behind quantum information processing is that quantum uncertainty — a fuzzy in-between “superposition” of 0 and 1 — is actually not a bug, but a feature. It provides new levers for more powerful ways to communicate and process data. One outcome of the probabilistic nature of quantum theory is that quantum information cannot be precisely copied. From a security lens, this is game-changing. Hackers trying to copy quantum keys used for encrypting and transmitting messages would be foiled, even if they had access to a quantum computer, or other powerful resources. This fundamentally unhackable encryption is based on the laws of physics, and not on the complex mathematical algorithms used today. While mathematical encryption techniques are vulnerable to being cracked by powerful enough computers, cracking quantum encryption would require violating the laws of physics. Just as quantum encryption is fundamentally different from current encryption methods based on mathematical complexity, quantum computers are fundamentally different from current classical computers. The two are as different as a car and a horse and cart. A car is based on harnessing different laws of physics compared to a horse and cart. It gets you to your destination faster and to new destinations previously out of reach. The same can be said for a quantum computer compared to a classical computer. A quantum computer harnesses the probabilistic laws of quantum physics to process data and perform computations in a novel way. It can complete certain computing tasks faster, and can perform new, previously impossible tasks such as, for example, quantum teleportation, where information encoded in quantum particles disappears in one location and is exactly (but not instantaneously) recreated in another location far away. While that sounds like sci-fi, this new form of data transmission could be a vital component of a future quantum internet. A particularly important application of quantum computers might be to simulate and analyze molecules for drug development and materials design. A quantum computer is uniquely suited for such tasks because it would operate on the same laws of quantum physics as the molecules it is simulating. Using a quantum device to simulate quantum chemistry could be far more efficient than using the fastest classical supercomputers today. Quantum computers are also ideally suited for solving complex optimization tasks and performing fast searches of unsorted data. This could be relevant for many applications, from sorting climate data or health or financial data, to optimizing supply chain logistics, or workforce management, or traffic flow. The quantum race is already underway. Governments and private investors all around the world are pouring billions of dollars into quantum research and development. Satellite-based quantum key distribution for encryption has been demonstrated, laying the groundwork for a potential quantum security-based global communication network. IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other companies are investing heavily in developing large-scale quantum computing hardware and software. Nobody is quite there yet. While small-scale quantum computers are operational today, a major hurdle to scaling up the technology is the issue of dealing with errors. Compared to bits, qubits are incredibly fragile. Even the slightest disturbance from the outside world is enough to destroy quantum information. That’s why most current machines need to be carefully shielded in isolated environments operating at temperatures far colder than outer space. While a theoretical framework for quantum error correction has been developed, implementing it in an energy- and resource-efficient manner poses significant engineering challenges. Given the current state of the field, it’s not clear when or if the full power of quantum computing will be accessible. Even so, business leaders should consider developing strategies to address three main areas: The rapid growth in the quantum tech sector over the past five years has been exciting. But the future remains unpredictable. Luckily, quantum theory tells us that unpredictability is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, two qubits can be locked together in such a way that individually they remain undetermined, but jointly they are perfectly in sync — either both qubits are 0 or both are 1. This combination of joint certainty and individual unpredictability — a phenomenon called entanglement — is a powerful fuel that drives many quantum computing algorithms. Perhaps it also holds a lesson for how to build a quantum industry. By planning responsibly, while also embracing future uncertainty, businesses can improve their odds of being ready for the quantum future.

"119",119,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/in-a-k-shaped-recovery-nonprofits-should-lean-on-major-donors","strategy.txt","As the United States moves through the pandemic, we’re seeing signs that our recovery from the initial economic shock will be K-shaped: That is, the well-off portion of the country will do very well, and the not-so-well-off portion won’t. How can nonprofits raise money in this kind of recovery? By strategically targeting their fundraising efforts on donors that are doing well. Seven tactics can be particularly helpful and are spelled out in this piece. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. America’s nonprofits are under enormous pressure. More than six months into the pandemic, those that provide direct social services are finding themselves overwhelmed by increased demand, because vastly larger numbers of families now need food, shelter, health care, and other forms of basic support. Many other nonprofits, such as performing-arts centers and choral groups, are simply unable to fulfill their missions during the pandemic. These organizations are hibernating, laying off staff, shepherding their cash, and holding their breath until the pandemic is over. Schools and colleges, meanwhile, are whipsawed between the options of opening in person and remotely, with all the obvious and subtle financial, pedagogic, and public health consequences. Virtually every nonprofit is struggling to deliver its services as safely and effectively as possible in a time of physical distancing, balancing its responsibilities to the public, its staff, and its mission. And nearly every nonprofit is worried about money. Earned income is down, because people aren’t buying theater tickets or museum admissions. Fundraising events have been cancelled or are being held online, generally with a vastly smaller haul for the organizations. Federal aid through the CARES Act, particularly the Payroll Protection Program, kept many nonprofits from going under through the spring and summer, but governmental funding is winding down, and stress levels among nonprofit executives are correspondingly rising. When nonprofits are under-resourced, their natural response is to turn to their donors. But is it realistic to expect a healthy stream of charitable contributions in the midst of the worst economic situation since the Great Depression? Absolutely — if you approach the right people. Because even as unemployment soars, as tens of thousands of businesses close, and as default and eviction rates rise, a small but significant portion of the population is doing just fine, thank you. Welcome to “the K-Shaped recovery,” in which the experience of the fortunate few is vastly different from the reality faced by the miserable many. Most of us are doing badly —some, desperately so — but others are doing well. Those at the top of the socio-economic heap have seen their investment portfolios recover from the early 2020 stock market crash. Tech companies are soaring. (Don’t you wish you’d bought a few shares of Zoom in January?). Amazon and national retail chains are thriving, even as the revenues of locally owned stores crater, and as corner bakeries and hairdressers close their doors. Workers who have been able to transition to home-based offices are getting by nicely; those who can’t, among them dishwashers, hotel housekeepers, and Uber drivers, have been hit hard and have yet to stagger to their feet. And some entire sectors, most notably the hospitality and travel industries, are struggling to gain traction. People naturally project their personal financial worries onto others and assume that everyone around them is feeling the same degree of pain. But if you’re a nonprofit leader marinating in financial anxiety, I can assure you that many of your supporters are not feeling any financial pinch at all. In fact, those wealthy few may even be a bit more comfortable than usual, because their travel and entertainment plans have been curtailed by the pandemic. This bifurcated economic recovery will undoubtedly amplify the trend of the last 40 years, where more and more charitable giving is coming from fewer and fewer donors. “Gilded Giving 2020,” a report from the Institute for Policy Studies, details this trend. The percentage of American households donating to charity dropped from 67% in 2002 to 53% in 2016, a decline that the report’s authors, Chuck Collins and Helen Flannery, blame largely on the increased economic precarity of the middle class. The report also notes that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which effectively removed the charitable-deduction incentives for tens of millions of taxpayers by doubling the standard deduction, served to dampen charitable giving further among middle- and upper-middle-class families. It does not take much imagination to presume that this troubling trend will accelerate in the era of Covid-19. Many Americans got out of the habit of giving to charity in the Great Recession. Many more will join them in 2020 and beyond. Meanwhile, the very wealthiest in our society are giving an ever-larger percentage of the charitable dollar — but often their philanthropy is not for causes that ameliorate the dire conditions caused by the economic crisis. In fact, Collins and Flannery report that nearly a quarter of charitable gifts in 2019 went not to operating nonprofits — that is, those that deliver services — but to private foundations and donor-advised funds controlled by the donors. This represents a tripling in the last 30 years of the percentage of donations going to private foundations, and a tripling in the last eight years of the percentage of donations going into donor-advised funds. Clearly, these entities, which critics disparagingly refer to as charitable warehouses, are doing very well, but their success arguably comes at the expense of charitable organizations that are actually working in our communities. There are significant societal and political consequences to the growing dependence of the charitable sector on donors from the top 1% of the socio-economic scale. Many of us find the enormous and growing wealth inequality — and the related dominance of donations from the wealthiest donors — to be deeply troubling. It’s possible that in the next decade, new tax policies will serve to narrow the wealth divide. But this larger socio-economic change won’t come in time for nonprofits to survive into 2021 and beyond. So what are nonprofit leaders to do? Here are seven recommendations: 1) Recognize that your wealthiest donors are likely to be unaffected by the economic downturn. Remind yourself that those at the top probably have as much or more wealth today than a year ago. 2) Keep in mind that top donors may well be more eager than usual to make gifts that have significance. The pandemic has caused us all to be more conscious of our mortality. We’re thinking about what is truly important in our lives. Many donors will be open to supporting causes that will live on beyond themselves. Many are without a doubt considering adding charitable bequests to their estate plans. 3) Approach those donors with larger requests than in the past. In his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, the Nobel Prize–winner Daniel Kahneman writes of the importance of “anchor points” in suggesting the price range that people are willing to consider. The anchor point is the starting point in financial transactions, such as the listing price for a house. Like a ship at anchor, the price may move from that first number, but not much. The anchor point — the first number mentioned — sets the buyer’s sense of what the final price will be. So too with fundraising: It’s important in 2020 to ask your wealthy donors for a large amount. Raise their expectations. If someone typically gives $1,000, ask for $2,500. If the top suggested giving level for your organization in the past was $5,000, make it $10,000. If it was $50,000, make it $100,000. 4) Explicitly ask your supporters with donor-advised funds and private foundations to distribute more from those funds than they have in the past. These are assets that are under the control of your donors, but the dollars have already been committed to charitable purposes. Suggest to your donors that these funds should not be considered endowed in perpetuity, but rather should be available as resources for a rainy day, and that, for nonprofits in the U.S., that rainy day has arrived. You might even mention the effort known as #HalfMyDAF — popularized recently by David and Jennifer Risher and other philanthropists — which encourages people to spend down at least 50% of their donor-advised funds in 2020 to meet the national emergency. 5) Don’t forget to remind your prosperous donors of the larger community needs. This might seem unnecessary — you might assume that everyone must be aware of the economic suffering in the wake of the pandemic — but ours is a largely compartmentalized society, and high-net-worth individuals tend to socialize with their peers. The very wealthy can grow detached from what is happening across town. Don’t hesitate to remind them of the challenges the community faces. 6) Give your less-wealthy donors ample opportunities to stay involved as supporters — and be empathetic to their situations. Approach your middle-class donors by acknowledging the difficulties everyone is facing in the pandemic. Ask after their health and welfare. Be sensitive to their probably reduced capacity to donate. Give them an opportunity to make a modest gift, one that may be smaller than in the past, and show appreciation for whatever they manage to give. Keeping these middle-class donors today will help you to draw from them in future, and presumably more prosperous, years. It also allows you to keep a broader base of supporters, something that provides both financial and moral benefit. 7) Give everyone a sense of hope. Ours is a traumatized society. The overlay of the public-health crisis, the economic disaster, the searing demands for racial justice, existential environmental fears, and the grinding, depressing, election-year political rhetoric has everyone on edge and looking for a better future. Do what you can to provide that vision of “The After,” once the pandemic is in the rear mirror and the economy begins to work better for everyone, not simply the few. Paint a picture of what your organization will provide in the post-pandemic world. In doing so, you will be implying how important it is, yes, to keep your organization from going under. But your focus should not be on your organization’s current financial challenges. Rather, you want to show how ensuring that your organization is vibrant, now and in the future, will provide enormous benefit to your community. As we turn the corner into the cooler days of autumn, and as the public health and economic crises show little sign of abating, nonprofit leaders need to be strategic in approaching their donors. They need to go where the money is. They need to be unabashed about seeking support, while remaining respectful and appreciative to all. And, through it all, they have to remember to paint a hopeful picture of the future. Our donors desperately need a dose of optimism — as do we all.

"120",120,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-amazon-automated-work-and-put-its-people-to-better-use","strategy.txt","Replacing people with AI may seem tempting, but it’s also likely a mistake. Amazon’s “hands off the wheel” initiative might be a model for how companies can adopt AI to automate repetitive jobs, but keep employees on the payroll by transferring them to more creative roles where they can add more value to the company. Amazon’s choice to eliminate jobs but retain the workers and move them into new roles allowed the company to be more nimble and find new ways to stay ahead of competitors. At an automation conference in late 2018, a high-ranking banking official looked up from his buffet plate and stated his objective without hesitation: I’m here, he told me, to eliminate full-time employees. I was at the conference because after spending months researching how Amazon automates work at its headquarters, I was eager to learn how other firms thought about this powerful technology. After one short interaction, it was clear that some have it completely wrong. For the past decade, Amazon has been pushing to automate office work under a program now known as Hands off the Wheel. The purpose was not to eliminate jobs but to automate tasks so that the company could reassign people to build new products — to do more with the people on staff, rather than doing the same with fewer people. The strategy appears to have paid off: At a time when it’s possible to start new businesses faster and cheaper than ever before, Hands off the Wheel has kept Amazon operating nimbly, propelled it ahead of its competitors, and shown that automating in order to fire can mean missing big opportunities. As companies look at how to integrate increasingly powerful AI capabilities into their businesses, they’d do well to consider this example. The animating idea behind Hands off the Wheel originated at Amazon’s South Lake Union office towers, where the company began automating work in the mid-2010s under an initiative some called Project Yoda. At the time, employees in Amazon’s retail management division spent their days making deals and working out product promotions as well as determining what items to stock in its warehouses, in what quantities, and for what price. But with two decades’ worth of retail data at its disposal, Amazon’s leadership decided to use “the force” (machine learning) to handle the formulaic processes involved in keeping warehouses stocked. “When you have actions that can be predicted over and over again, you don’t need people doing them,” Neil Ackerman, an ex-Amazon general manager, told me. The project began in 2012, when Amazon hired Ralf Herbrich as its director of machine learning and made the automation effort one of his launch projects. Getting the software to be good at inventory management and pricing predictions took years, Herbrich told me, because his team had to account for low-volume product orders that befuddled its data-hungry machine-learning algorithms. By 2015, the team’s machine-learning predictions were good enough that Amazon’s leadership placed them in employees’ software tools, turning them into a kind of copilot for human workers. But at that point the humans could override the suggestions, and many did, setting back progress. Eventually, though, automation took hold. “It took a few years to slowly roll it out, because there was training to be done,” Herbrich said. If the system couldn’t make its own decisions, he explained, it couldn’t learn. Leadership required employees to automate a large number of tasks, though that varied across divisions. “In 2016, my goals for Hands off the Wheel were 80% of all my activity,” one ex-employee told me.” By 2018 Hands off the Wheel was part of business as usual. Having delivered on his project, Herbrich left the company in 2020. The transition to Hands off the Wheel wasn’t easy. The retail division employees were despondent at first, recognizing that their jobs were transforming. “It was a total change,” the former employee mentioned above said. “Something that you were incentivized to do, now you’re being disincentivized to do.” Yet in time, many saw the logic. “When we heard that ordering was going to be automated by algorithms, on the one hand, it’s like, ‘OK, what’s happening to my job?’” another former employee, Elaine Kwon, told me. “On the other hand, you’re also not surprised. You’re like, ‘OK, as a business this makes sense.’” Although some companies might have seen an opportunity to reduce head count, Amazon assigned the employees new work. The company’s retail division workers largely moved into product and program manager jobs — fast-growing roles within Amazon that typically belong to professional inventors. Product managers oversee new product development, while program managers oversee groups of projects. “People who were doing these mundane repeated tasks are now being freed up to do tasks that are about invention,” Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s departing CEO of Worldwide Consumer, told me. “The things that are harder for machines to do.” Had Amazon eliminated those jobs, it would have made its flagship business more profitable but most likely would have caused itself to miss its next new businesses. Instead of automating to milk a single asset, it set out to build new ones. Consider Amazon Go, the company’s checkout-free convenience store. Go was founded, in part, by Dilip Kumar, an executive once in charge of the company’s pricing and promotions operations. While Kumar spent two years acting as a technical adviser to CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s machine learning engineers began automating work in his old division, so he took a new lead role in a project aimed at eliminating the most annoying part of shopping in real life: checking out. Kumar helped dream up Go, which is now a pillar of Amazon’s broader strategy. If Amazon is any indication, businesses that reassign employees after automating their work will thrive. Those that don’t risk falling behind. In shaky economic times, the need for cost-cutting could make it tempting to replace people with machines, but I’ll offer a word of warning: Think twice before doing that. It’s a message I wish I had shared with the banker."

What explains the huge gap between adoption of these mobile payment services in the two countries? The authors argue that it’s largely a question of approach. Based on our their experience in the financial services industry and work with platform companies, the authors identified two key strategic drivers for successful platform adoption: 1) Create value for all parties, not just the consumer, and 2) Monetize the ecosystem, not just the product. Even before Covid-19, mobile payment platforms were experiencing a boom in the U.S. and China. Apple Pay (U.S.) and Alipay (China) have radically changed the way people transact, offering secure, contactless payment options through mobile phones. Though both platforms are growing, Alipay is outperforming its U.S. peer: As of late 2019, Bain & Company found that only 9% of American consumers had adopted Apple Pay while 81% of Chinese consumers used Alipay. Given the size difference between the two countries, the difference between the number of Alipay users in China and Apple Pay users in the U.S. is staggeringly large. What are some of the factors driving this stark contrast? Based on our extensive financial services industry experience and work with platform companies, we found two key strategic drivers for successful platform adoption: 1) Create value for all parties and 2) Monetize the ecosystem, not just the product. So far, Apple Pay has only marginally accomplished the first while Alipay has mastered both. Other platform leaders can learn from their examples. The Steve Jobs-driven culture of focusing relentlessly on customer experience was core to Apple’s development of Apple Pay, which launched in 2014. The premise was simple: Apple Pay relied on encrypted near-field communication (NFC) signals from point of sale devices that would allow users to pay with their iPhones instead of a credit card. Apple Pay seemed to offer a genuinely futuristic consumer experience that was secure, seamless, and fast: NFC technology is extremely quick, and consumers can use their fingerprint to authenticate the transaction, significantly reducing fraud. But for the average U.S. consumer, paying with Apple Pay only saved a few seconds during in-store transactions and thus was only marginally more convenient than paying with a debit or credit card. Apple was less focused on mutually beneficial partnerships with banks and merchants. Assuming customers would adopt their platform quickly, Apple attempted to monetize it from the very beginning and charged banks and issuers around 0.15% per transaction for Apple Pay — on top of regular credit card processing fees, which range from 1.15% + $0.05 to 3.15% + $0.10 per transaction. This meant that there was little incentive to adopt the new technology — especially given implementation costs for new NFC-equipped point of sale terminals, which could cost between $1,000 and $2,000 when accounting for necessary software and training for employees. Around the time of Apple Pay’s launch, only around 10% of all point of sale terminals were NFC enabled, and the cost challenge to merchants and limited benefit to consumers hampered adoption. In 2019, five years after its launch, Apple Pay’s domestic growth remained slow: Only around 6% of people who could use Apple Pay at a physical point of sale were doing so, despite the fact that almost all point-of-sale terminals that are shipped in North America today are NFC enabled. There’s good reason to believe the number of users has grown significantly during the pandemic, but it would require years of exponential growth in adoption to even begin to match Alipay’s dominance in China. Alipay, which was spun off from Alibaba in 2011 and became Ant Financial (now Ant Group) in 2014, grew from a consumer need for a trusted, verified way to pay for goods purchased from parent company Alibaba’s massive e-commerce sites. Alipay was the solution, but the strategy behind it went beyond payments. Alipay charges around a 0.6% transaction fee to merchants to process a transaction, roughly half of the fee for processing local credit cards. While the fee is more expensive than allowing customers to use cash, merchants could often expect a lift in sales that came from accepting Alipay. Further, for merchants, the implementation cost to accept Alipay in stores is extremely low, as Alipay doesn’t rely on NFC or any specialized point-of-sale system, but relies on QR codes, which require little more than a camera and an internet connection to make a purchase. Alipay took a different approach to creating value and monetizing the platform than Apple Pay. It shared many types of consumer insights with merchants, so they could offer new services to clients and launch accurate promotions for free. Ant Group worked with merchants and consumers who used Alipay to improve security protection and reduce losses, helping merchants make more money and decrease their risk. Small to medium-sized businesses flocked to Alipay to capture new business with minimal investment. From 2014 to 2018, the number of merchants that accepted Alipay went from approximately 1 million to 30 million, meaning roughly 70% of all merchants in China accepted the platform. As Alipay grew, Ant Group was also able to use the data to build new partnerships and offer new services, which they monetized. Trillions of dollars of transactions flow through Alipay versus billions on Apple Pay. Based on the payment data that Ant Group receives, the company can offer a host of high-margin products to both consumers and merchants. For young and lower-class consumers, Ant Group offers credit cards and wealth management services. For small to medium-sized merchants, Ant offers small, short-term loans. These products are not traditionally available to these segments and are hugely valuable. The success of these products has prompted Ant Group’s valuation to go from $75 billion in 2016 to $200 billion just four years later. To be sure, there are caveats to the story. First, there are important differences between the U.S. and Chinese mobile payments space. Among them, China is jumping from cash to mobile payments while the U.S. is transitioning from credit cards to contactless payments, which include mobile payments and “tap to pay” credit and debit cards. The mobile internet also evolved much more rapidly in China than the U.S., and mobile payments were a logical part of that evolution. Additionally, the Chinese economy has grown very rapidly, giving Chinese payments players — including Alipay’s main competitor, WeChat Pay — strong tailwinds. Consumer preferences are also changing. Prior to Covid-19, many U.S. consumers and merchants were concerned with speed, convenience and security when transacting. Now, these same parties are focused on health and safety and are adopting contactless payments in greater numbers. In this context, Apple Pay has emerged as a solution to a different problem than the one it originally meant to solve. This shift in preferences, already clearly underway, may require that payment companies think about value differently than before. The lesson for platform leaders, therefore, has two parts. First, leaders must provide value for all parties on the platform by addressing high-priority pain points, which may change over time. Second, platform leaders must monetize the ecosystem and not just the product, ensuring that they do not burden customers on one side of platform and hamper overall adoption in the process. By learning from mobile payments and considering the strategic drivers of adoption, platform leaders in other industries can ensure they are thought of as more Alipay than Apple Pay.

"122",122,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-to-win-with-machine-learning","strategy.txt","Many companies can dramatically improve their products and services by using machine learning—an application of artificial intelligence that involves generating predictions from data inputs. Amazon, Google, and other tech giants are already experts at taking advantage of this technology. Smaller enterprises and late entrants, however, may be unsure how to do likewise to gain market share for themselves. This article suggests that early movers will be successful if they have enough training data to make accurate predictions and if they can improve their algorithms by quickly incorporating feedback derived from customers’ behavior. Latecomers will need a different approach to be competitive: The secret for them is to find untapped sources of training or feedback data, or to differentiate themselves by tailoring predictions to a special niche. As more companies deploy machine learning for AI-enabled products and services, they face the challenge of carving out a defensible market position, especially if they are latecomers. The most successful AI users capture a good pool of training data early and then exploit feedback data to open up a value gap—in terms of prediction quality—between themselves and later movers. Latecomers can still secure a foothold if they can find sources of superior training data or feedback data, or if they tailor their predictions to a specific niche. The past decade has brought tremendous advances  in an exciting dimension of artificial intelligence—machine learning. This technique for taking data inputs and turning them into predictions has enabled tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google to dramatically improve their products. It has also spurred start-ups to launch new products and platforms, sometimes even in competition with Big Tech.   Consider BenchSci, a Toronto-based company that seeks to speed the drug development process. It aims to make it easier for scientists to find needles in haystacks—to zero in on the most crucial information embedded in pharma companies’ internal databases and in the vast wealth of published scientific research. To get a new drug candidate into clinical trials, scientists must run costly and time-consuming experiments. BenchSci realized that scientists could conduct fewer of these—and achieve greater success—if they applied better insights from the huge number of experiments that had already been run. Indeed, BenchSci found that if scientists took advantage of machine learning that read, classified, and then presented insights from scientific research, they could halve the number of experiments normally required to advance a drug to clinical trials. More specifically, they could use the technology to find the right biological reagents—essential substances for influencing and measuring protein expression. Identifying those by combing through the published literature rather than rediscovering them from scratch helps significantly cut the time it takes to produce new drug candidates. That adds up to potential savings of over $17 billion annually, which, in an industry where the returns to R&D have become razor-thin, could transform the market. In addition, many lives could be saved by bringing new drugs to market more quickly. What is remarkable here is that BenchSci, in its specialized domain, is doing something akin to what Google has been doing for the whole of the internet: using machine learning to lead in search. Just as Google can help you figure out how to fix your dishwasher and save you a long trip to the library or a costly repair service, BenchSci helps scientists identify a suitable reagent without incurring the trouble or expense of excessive research and experimentation. Previously, scientists would often use Google or PubMed to search the literature (a process that took days), then read the literature (again spending days), and then order and test three to six reagents before choosing one (over a period of weeks). Now they search BenchSci in minutes and then order and test one to three reagents before choosing one (conducting fewer tests over fewer weeks). Many companies are already working with AI and are aware of the practical steps for integrating it into their operations and leveraging its power. But as that proficiency grows, companies will need to consider a broader issue: How do you take advantage of machine learning to create a defensible moat around the business—to create something that competitors can’t easily imitate? In BenchSci’s case, for instance, will its initial success attract competition from Google—and if so, how does BenchSci retain its lead? In the following pages, we explain how companies entering industries with an AI-enabled product or service can build a sustainable competitive advantage and raise entry barriers against latecomers. We note that moving early can often be a big plus, but it’s not the whole story. As we discuss, late adopters of the new technology can still advance—or at least recover some lost ground—by finding a niche. Businesses use machine learning to recognize patterns and then make predictions—about what will appeal to customers, improve operations, or help make a product better. Before you can build a strategy around such predictions, however, you must understand the inputs necessary for the prediction process, the challenges involved in getting those inputs, and the role of feedback in enabling an algorithm to make better predictions over time. A prediction, in the context of machine learning, is an information output that comes from entering some data and running an algorithm. For example, when your mobile navigation app serves up a prediction about the best route between two points, it uses input data on traffic conditions, speed limits, road size, and other factors. An algorithm is then employed to predict the fastest way to go and the time that will take. The key challenge with any prediction process is that training data—the inputs you need in order to start getting reasonable outcomes—has to be either created (by, say, hiring experts to classify things) or procured from existing sources (say, health records). Some kinds of data are easy to acquire from public sources (think of weather and map information). Consumers may also willingly supply personal data if they perceive a benefit from doing so. Fitbit and Apple Watch users, for example, allow the companies to gather metrics about their exercise level, calorie intake, and so forth through devices that users wear to manage their health and fitness. Moving early can often be a big plus, but it’s not the whole story. Obtaining training data to enable predictions can be difficult, however, if it requires the cooperation of a large number of individuals who do not directly benefit from providing it. For instance, a navigation app can collect data about traffic conditions by tracking users and getting reports from them. This allows the app to identify likely locations for traffic jams and to alert other drivers who are heading toward them. But drivers already caught in the snarls get little direct payoff from participating, and they may be troubled by the idea that the app knows where they are at any moment (and is potentially recording their movements). If people in traffic jams decline to share their data or actually switch off their geolocators, the app’s ability to warn users of traffic problems will be compromised. Another challenge may be the need to periodically update training data. This isn’t always an issue; it won’t apply if the basic context in which the prediction was made stays constant. Radiology, for example, analyzes human physiology, which is generally consistent from person to person and over time. Thus, after a certain point, the marginal value of an extra record in the training database is almost zero. However, in other cases algorithms may need to be frequently updated with completely new data reflecting changes in the underlying environment. With navigational apps, for instance, new roads or traffic circles, renamed streets, and similar changes will render the app’s predictions less accurate over time unless the maps that form part of the initial training data are updated. In many situations, algorithms can be continuously improved through the use of feedback data, which is obtained by mapping actual outcomes to the input data that generated predictions of those outcomes. This tool is particularly helpful in situations where there can be considerable variation within clearly defined boundaries. For instance, when your phone uses an image of you for security, you will have initially trained the phone to recognize you. But your face can change significantly. You may or may not be wearing glasses. You may have gotten a new hairstyle, put on makeup, or gained or lost weight. Thus the prediction that you are you may become less reliable if the phone relies solely on the initial training data. But what actually happens is that the phone updates its algorithm using all the images you provide each time you unlock it. Creating these kinds of feedback loops is far from straightforward in dynamic contexts and where feedback cannot be easily categorized and sourced. Feedback data for the smartphone face-recognition app, for example, creates better predictions only if the sole person inputting facial data is the phone’s owner. If other people look similar enough to get into the phone and continue using it, the phone’s prediction that the user is the owner becomes unreliable. It can also be dangerously easy to introduce biases into machine learning, especially if multiple factors are in play. Suppose a lender uses an AI-enabled process to assess the credit risk of loan applicants, considering their income level, employment history, demographic characteristics, and so forth. If the training data for the algorithm discriminates against a certain group—say, people of color—the feedback loop will perpetuate or even accentuate that bias, making it increasingly likely that applicants of color are rejected. Feedback is almost impossible to incorporate safely into an algorithm without carefully defined parameters and reliable, unbiased sources. In many ways, building a sustainable business in machine learning is much like building a sustainable business in any industry. You have to come in with a sellable product, carve out a defensible early position, and make it harder for anyone to come in behind you. Whether you can do that depends on your answers to three questions: At the get-go, a prediction machine needs to generate predictions that are good enough to be commercially viable. The definition of “good enough” might be set by regulation (for example, an AI for making medical diagnoses must meet government standards), usability (a chatbot has to work smoothly enough for callers to respond to the machine rather than wait to speak to a human in the call center), or competition (a company seeking to enter the internet search market needs a certain level of predictive accuracy to compete with Google). One barrier to entry, therefore, is the amount of time and effort involved in creating or accessing sufficient training data to make good-enough predictions. This barrier can be high. Take the case of radiology, where a prediction machine needs to be measurably better than highly skilled humans in order to be trusted with people’s lives. That suggests that the first company to build a generally applicable AI for radiology (one that can read any scanned image) will have little competition at first because so much data is needed for success. But the initial advantage may be short-lived if the market is growing rapidly, because in a fast-growing market the payoff from having access to the training data will probably be large enough to attract multiple big companies with deep pockets. This, of course, means that training-data entry requirements are subject to the economics of scale, like so much else. High-growth markets attract investments, and over time this raises the threshold for the next new entrant (and forces everyone already in the sector to spend more on developing or marketing their products). Thus the more data you can train your machines on, the bigger the hurdle for anyone coming after you, which brings us to the second question. Prediction machines exploit what has traditionally been the human advantage—they learn. If they can incorporate feedback data, then they can learn from outcomes and improve the quality of the next prediction. The extent of this advantage, however, depends on the time it takes to get feedback. With a radiology scan, if an autopsy is required to assess whether a machine-learning algorithm correctly predicted cancer, then feedback will be slow, and although a company may have an early lead in collecting and reading scans, it will be limited in its ability to learn and thus sustain its lead. By contrast, if feedback data can be generated quickly after obtaining the prediction, then an early lead will translate into a sustained competitive advantage, because the minimum efficient scale will soon be out of the reach of even the biggest companies. When Microsoft launched the Bing search engine in 2009, it had the company’s full backing. Microsoft invested billions of dollars in it. Yet more than a decade later, Bing’s market share remains far below Google’s, in both search volume and search advertising revenue. One reason Bing found it hard to catch up was the feedback loop. In search, the time between the prediction (offering up a page with several suggested links in response to a query) and the feedback (the user’s clicking on one of the links) is short—usually seconds. In other words, the feedback loop is fast and powerful. Peter Greenwood By the time Bing entered the market, Google had already been operating an AI-based search engine for a decade or more, helping millions of users and performing billions of searches daily. Every time a user made a query, Google provided its prediction of the most relevant links, and then the user selected the best of those links, enabling Google to update its prediction model. That allowed for constant learning in light of a constantly expanding search space. With so much training data based on so many users, Google could identify new events and new trends more quickly than Bing could. In the end, the fast feedback loop, combined with other factors—Google’s continued investment in massive data-processing facilities, and the real or perceived costs to customers of switching to another engine—meant that Bing always lagged. Other search engines that tried to compete with Google and Bing never even got started. The success of any product ultimately depends on what you get for what you pay. If consumers are offered two similar products at the same price, they will generally choose the one they perceive to be of higher quality. Prediction quality, as we’ve already noted, is often easy to assess. In radiology, search, advertising, and many other contexts, companies can design AIs with a clear, single metric for quality: accuracy. As in other industries, the highest-quality products benefit from higher demand. AI-based products are different from others, however, because for most other products, better quality costs more, and sellers of inferior goods survive by using cheaper materials or less-expensive manufacturing processes and then charging lower prices. This strategy isn’t as feasible in the context of AI. Because AI is software-based, a low-quality prediction is as expensive to produce as a high-quality one, making discount pricing unrealistic. And if the better prediction is priced the same as the worse one, there is no reason to purchase the lower-quality one. For Google, this is another factor explaining why its lead in search may be unassailable. Competitors’ predictions often look pretty similar to Google’s. Enter the word “weather” into Google or Bing, and the results will be much the same—forecasts will pop up first. But if you enter a less common term, differences may emerge. If you type in, say, “disruption,” Bing’s first page will usually show dictionary definitions, while Google provides both definitions and links to research papers on the topic of disruptive innovation. Although Bing can perform as well as Google for some text queries, for others it’s less accurate in predicting what consumers are looking for. And there are few if any other search categories where Bing is widely seen as superior. The bottom line is that in AI, an early mover can build a scale-based competitive advantage if feedback loops are fast and performance quality is clear. So what does this mean for late movers? Buried in the three questions are clues to two ways in which a late entrant can carve out its own space in the market. Would-be contenders needn’t choose between these approaches; they can try both. In some markets for prediction tools, there may be reservoirs of potential training data that incumbents have not already captured. Going back to the example of radiology, tens of thousands of doctors are each reading thousands of scans a year, meaning that hundreds of millions (or even billions) of new data points are available. Early entrants will have training data from a few hundred radiologists. Of course, once their software is running in the field, the number of scans and the amount of feedback in their database will increase substantially, but the billions of scans previously analyzed and verified represent an opportunity for laggards to catch up, assuming they are able to pool the scans and analyze them in the aggregate. If that’s the case, they might be able to develop an AI that makes good-enough predictions to go to market, after which they too can benefit from feedback. Latecomers could also consider training an AI using pathology or autopsy data rather than human diagnoses. That strategy would enable them to reach the quality threshold sooner (because biopsies and autopsies are more definitive than body scans), though the subsequent feedback loop would be slower. Alternatively, instead of trying to find untapped sources of training data, latecomers could look for new sources of feedback data that enable faster learning than what incumbents are using. (BenchSci is an example of a company that has succeeded in doing this.) By being first with a novel supply of faster feedback data, the newcomer can then learn from the actions and choices of its users to make its product better. But in markets where feedback loops are already fairly rapid and where incumbents are operating at scale, the opportunities for pulling off this approach will be relatively limited. And significantly faster feedback would likely trigger a disruption of current practices, meaning that the new entrants would not really be competing with established companies but instead displacing them. Another tactic that can help late entrants become competitive is to redefine what makes a prediction “better,” even if only for some customers. In radiology, for example, such a strategy could be possible if there is market demand for different types of predictions. Early entrants most likely trained their algorithms with data from one hospital system, one type of hardware, or one country. By using training data (and then feedback data) from another system or another country, the newcomer could customize its AI for that user segment if it is sufficiently distinct. If, say, urban Americans and people in rural China tend to experience different health conditions, then a prediction machine built to diagnose one of those groups might not be as accurate for diagnosing patients in the other group. Latecomers could look for new sources of feedback data that enable faster learning. Creating predictions that rely on data coming from a particular type of hardware could also provide a market opportunity, if that business model results in lower costs or increases accessibility for customers. Many of today’s AIs for radiology draw upon data from the most widely used X-ray machines, scanners, and ultrasound devices made by GE, Siemens, and other established manufacturers. However, if the algorithms are applied to data from other machines, the resulting predictions may be less accurate. Thus a late entrant could find a niche by offering a product tailored to that other equipment—which might be attractive for medical facilities to use if it is cheaper to purchase or operate or is specialized to meet the needs of particular customers.  The potential of prediction machines is immense, and there is no doubt that the tech giants have a head start. But it’s worth remembering that predictions are like precisely engineered products, highly adapted for specific purposes and contexts. If you can differentiate the purposes and contexts even a little, you can create a defensible space for your own product. Although the devil is in the details of how you collect and use data, your salvation rests there as well. Nonetheless, the real key to competing successfully with Big Tech in industries powered by intelligent machines lies in a question that only a human can answer: What is it that you want to predict? Of course, figuring out the answer is not easy. Doing so necessitates a deep understanding of market dynamics and thoughtful analysis of the potential worth of specific predictions and the products and services in which they are embedded. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the lead investor in BenchSci’s Series A2 financing was not one of the many local Canadian tech investors but rather an AI-focused venture capital firm called Gradient Ventures—owned by Google.

Joint ventures and partnerships can help many firms with those efforts. In this article three consultants outline how companies can shore up their existing JVs through capital-raising, cost-reduction, and synergy-tapping techniques that often aren’t available to wholly owned entities. The authors then describe how parent companies can strengthen their own financial positions by using JVs and partnerships to make partial divestments, consolidate businesses, and collaborate on capital-light, low-risk growth initiatives. JVs are already ubiquitous in sectors under pressure, like energy, and in innovative industries such as life sciences. At numerous firms, they drive a large share of earnings. Given that their returns have been climbing, their impact is quite likely to remain strong or even increase in the foreseeable future. Joint ventures and partnerships will play an outsize role in corporations’ response to the recession and their plans for growth during the recovery that follows. JVs and partnerships are ubiquitous in sectors that are under the most pressure (like energy and health care) and in innovative industries (like life sciences and tech). In addition, joint ventures and minority-equity investments are now outperforming wholly owned businesses and acquisitions. Corporations can use existing ventures—and form new ones—to raise cash, reduce capital intensity, and cut operating expenses, and more important, as a cost-effective way to pursue promising new opportunities. Companies will need every tool they’ve got  to survive the downturn and rev up their businesses as the economy rights itself. They’ll have to rewire operations, reallocate resources, and in some cases reinvent business models.   At many firms, joint ventures and partnerships will play an outsize role in those efforts, both as a vehicle for sharing costs and reducing capital needs during the crisis and as a way to position themselves for growth once it ends. After all, in industries experiencing great pressure—like automotive, retail, and upstream oil and gas—joint ventures are quite common. GM and Volkswagen, for example, each have several dozen, and JVs account for almost 80% of the upstream production of the largest international oil and gas companies. At these and other energy businesses, joint ventures are also key to managing the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. More than 50% of the largest assets in offshore wind and solar are structured as joint ventures—and such investments are a critical way for companies like Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total, and Equinor to share risks, build capabilities, and meet ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In health care and life sciences, joint ventures and partnerships are crucial to innovation: More than two-thirds of new health insurance products in the United States are built on cobranded or JV offerings, while life sciences companies depend on such ventures to accelerate time to market and broaden distribution of lifesaving products. In March 2020, for instance, Pfizer and BioNTech announced they were teaming up to bring out a Covid-19 vaccine. Other partnerships aimed at developing Covid vaccines have been announced by Sanofi and GSK, and by Hoth Therapeutics, Voltron Therapeutics, and Mass General Hospital. JVs now drive a material share of companies’ profits as well. In 2019 Airbus, Celanese, Engie, Vodafone, and Volkswagen relied on noncontrolled JVs for more than 20% of their earnings, while at Coca-Cola, GM, and many others that figure was above 10%. Moving forward, we expect the impact of JVs and partnerships to remain significant and, in some sectors and geographies, to increase. We recently analyzed trends related to joint ventures across the past 35 years. Our analysis showed that in most industries, terminations of them didn’t always increase during downturns—and often fell. Use of JVs also tended to rise on the eve of a recovery. 
  This may be partly due to the time it takes to negotiate a restructuring or an exit, as well as corporate management’s tendency to look first to wholly owned operations when cutting costs. In addition, JVs’ returns on assets have been climbing recently—and are higher than those of wholly owned companies in the same industries. 
  That means the number of terminations during this economic dip is likely to be even lower. Meanwhile, our analysis also showed that new joint venture and partnership transactions tend to increase during a downturn and to accelerate during a recovery, because they allow companies to get off to a much quicker start than organic growth does and are less risky than M&A. Terminations don’t always increase during recessions and decline quickly afterward. Joint ventures’ ROA is higher than the ROA of alternative investments. In this article we’ll look at how during this period of retrenchment firms might stabilize their existing joint ventures by raising cash, cutting operating costs, reducing capital spending, managing risk, and restructuring. These are commonsense moves for the most part, but they require sustained focus; JVs are hard to restructure even in the best of times, owing to differing owner-company agendas, politicized processes, and general inertia. However, a crisis can serve as a catalyst for change. In addition, we’ll look at how companies might enter into new, “counterdownturn” JVs and partnerships, both to manage the challenging economic environment and to tap into growth opportunities in capital-light ways. Joint ventures are facing many of the same financial challenges—severe revenue shortfalls from fractured supply chains, curtailed operations, evaporating market demand, and frozen credit markets—as their owners and wholly owned peers. These new economic realities require both short- and long-term responses. Efforts to reduce working capital, cut costs, tap additional credit lines, and take advantage of government subsidies and relief programs are already well under way in most joint ventures. To help pull off these near-term interventions, their boards will need to get far more involved than usual. Under normal conditions, joint ventures’ board directors spend an average of 5% to 10% of their time on governance. But during economic storms, an effective board can be the factor that determines whether a JV thrives, stagnates, or dies an untimely death. Working with managers, directors are convening special board and committee meetings and fast-tracking decisions. JV partners, boards, and management teams will also need to evaluate opportunities to more fundamentally reset their businesses. Because of their shared ownership, joint ventures can use restructuring tools that aren’t available to wholly owned businesses. These approaches may benefit a venture, its parents, or both. They come in various forms. Some joint ventures will have opportunities to secure low- or interest-free loans or capital from their cash-rich owners—such as state-owned companies, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms, and multinationals with strong balance sheets. In exchange, those owners might get additional interest in the venture, preferred returns, or increased control. In 2015, when Russian automobile sales collapsed amid wider economic problems, Ford Sollers, a 50:50 joint venture between Ford and Sollers PJSC, received additional funding from Ford, which in return got preferred shares that gave it majority voting rights. To free up cash, improve future liquidity, or open up new markets, joint ventures may also want to bring in new owners, such as PE firms, pension funds, other financial institutions, or strategic industry partners. Earnouts for the current owners could be pegged to the future performance of the business to make adding more owners attractive. Many investors, like PE firms, can bring in capabilities that give ventures a boost, including a better understanding of value creation, a sharp focus on cost reduction and talent management, governance discipline, M&A experience, and a portfolio that can double as an ecosystem of customers, suppliers, or partners. Structuring creative commercial arrangements with suppliers, customers, lenders, and other business partners is another option for JV owners. In the past we’ve seen an ownership interest or option sold to a major supplier or customer in exchange for better commercial terms, including cash advances. If one of the owners is a major supplier to the JV, the parties might renegotiate their agreement (to, say, narrow the band of prices). Similarly, a joint venture might negotiate with a lender to convert debt to equity, making the creditor a direct owner. While JVs can cut costs on their own, much greater savings may come from consolidating or otherwise optimizing activities and assets with their owners. Ventures and owners might make joint purchases, integrate their supply chains, or combine some infrastructure, logistics, warehouses, or other operating assets. In 2003, Vodafone entered an agreement with SFR, its French mobile-telecommunications JV with Vivendi, to collaborate to improve economies of scale in operational areas like the development and rollout of new offerings and procurement, especially of technology. Joint ventures might also save money by insourcing certain functions (such as legal, HR, IT, or finance) currently being provided by an owner. Our analysis has shown that although owner companies rarely profit from providing administrative services to joint ventures, their cost structures are often 10% to 30% higher than those of the JVs or of third-party providers they might contract with. Conversely, a joint venture that lacks scale might benefit from outsourcing certain functions to an owner or a third party. Susana Raab/INSTITUTE In some cases cost cutting may lead to more-fundamental changes to the operating model. Those that reduce operating expenses or increase strategic and financial flexibility are especially popular during downturns. A lower-cost partner in a joint venture or a third party might become the controlling partner or operator, which can open up synergies with that organization. In our view many joint ventures should aggressively pursue this option, which allows greater nimbleness and offers more potential for performance improvement than do JV models in which control is shared by the partners and the joint venture’s management doesn’t have much authority. In response to the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, BASF and Mitsubishi creatively restructured their equally owned and controlled joint venture in Japan, Mitsubishi Chemical BASF. It was split into two joint ventures, one focused on dispersants and the other on foam products—the business’s two core segments. Each was placed under the operational leadership of the parent best positioned to strengthen it—with BASF responsible for the dispersants venture, and Mitsubishi responsible for the foam products one. Joint venture boards might also consider authorizing or compelling management to increase external borrowing, especially if the entity is underleveraged, as JVs tend to be. Conversely, if a venture has excess cash, the board might seek to repatriate it to fund other, pressing corporate needs. During the 2008 financial crisis, the board of a large liquefied-natural-gas JV found that it had almost $500 million in cash on hand—enough to cover six months of operating costs. The board immediately approved a $300 million dividend, giving the owners cash to weather the storm elsewhere in their businesses. Downturns tend to expose strategy and performance differences among partners. While the data doesn’t suggest they cause buyouts to spike, inevitably there will be some buyouts and sellouts, and some JVs will be terminated or liquidated. Joint ventures can use restructuring tools that wholly owned businesses cannot. In the current environment, routine decisions about budgets and capital expenditures may become deadlocked, triggering buy-sell options in about a third of joint venture contracts. In other cases the potential synergies will be greater if a single partner has full ownership, and the one for whom the JV is more core—or already more integrated—will buy out the other partners. Or one owner might acquire and integrate parts of the joint venture or sell out to a third party. After the 2008–2009 financial crisis forced the Canadian company Nortel to file for bankruptcy protection, for example, it sold its controlling stake in a high-performing Korean joint venture with LG to Ericsson. Alternatively, all the owners might sell the venture to a consortium of financial investors. New JVs and partnerships can also help companies navigate the economic crisis. They can be used to raise cash, secure cost synergies, or pursue lower-risk and more-capital-efficient growth. When funding is tight, such benefits make joint ventures and partnerships a popular alternative to mergers and acquisitions or organic investments. Our analysis shows that JVs and partnerships tend to increase in the late stages of a downturn, signaling a recovery and outpacing M&A. Right after the 1990–1992 and 2001–2002 downturns, for instance, the number of new joint ventures and partnership transactions was 20% above normal levels. For companies that need more liquidity, a joint venture can be a good alternative to a full divestiture. One approach is to use it as the first step in a planned exit: A seller puts a noncore business into a joint venture with a potential buyer and negotiates to sell the full business over time, typically within three to five years. This kind of deal is especially worthwhile for sellers when prospective buyers don’t recognize the full potential of the business or its assets or may not be able to buy or operate the business on day one. IBM used this staged-exit structure when it sold its personal computer business to Lenovo, and so did Lanxess when it folded its specialty plastics business into a joint venture with Ineos, in 2007. In that case, Lanxess received one payment when the joint venture was set up and a second after two years, when it fully exited the JV. The second payment was based on the performance of the business—a useful method when it’s difficult to arrive at a valuation. Another approach is to sell a partial interest in a business unit to a third party, effectively converting the business into a joint venture. Dow Chemical famously pursued such a game-changing structure in 2008, when it tried to sell key elements of its commodity-chemical business to Kuwait’s state-owned Petrochemicals Industry Company to raise cash and reduce exposure to the cyclical commodity-chemical business. But it was left at the altar when the Kuwaiti parliament rejected the deal at the last minute. During the Asian financial crisis, Doosan agreed to sell a 50% interest in its Oriental Brewery unit to the global player Interbrew to raise cash. The deal gave Oriental Brewery access to new technologies, marketing networks, and cost management capabilities that lifted its performance. In a similar move, from 2008 to 2010, Chesapeake Energy raised more than $8 billion by selling a partial interest in its U.S. shale gas assets to BP, Equinor, Total, and others. A creative third alternative is an asset sale with a leaseback. Through such deals, companies typically divest certain (noncore) assets but tie them to a joint venture. For instance, as part of an aggressive corporate restructuring program it ran from 2005 to 2007, Sony sold its chip-manufacturing facilities to Toshiba for more than $800 million; those assets were then leased back to a new joint venture between the companies, which produced chips for the PlayStation and other Sony consumer electronics. Synergies from this kind of joint venture can be substantial. There is a range of options here. At the narrower end of the spectrum, companies (especially those in the natural resources sector) consolidate a set of adjacent assets into a single joint venture to align all the parties’ incentives better and save money on infrastructure. Extending that logic more broadly to an entire region, country, or business unit, companies can consolidate similar operations with those of an industry peer or competitor to capture additional scale or cost synergies. In 2009 Morgan Stanley and Citibank consolidated their retail brokerage and wealth management businesses into a 51:49 joint venture in which Citibank also received an up-front cash payment of $2.7 billion. In a similar vein, in 2013 Bertelsmann and Pearson combined their trade-book publishing businesses, which were facing headwinds, into a 53:47 joint venture, Penguin Random House. Companies might also team up with industry peers to consolidate back-office, sales, or purchasing functions into joint ventures and realize greater economies of scale. The big three U.S. automakers have done this in forming global purchasing joint ventures. Oil and gas companies have also pursued purchasing cooperatives, logistics pooling, shared maintenance and inventory management ventures, and other collaborative structures. So have telecom companies. For instance, Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom-Orange formed BuyIn, a purchasing joint venture in which the companies pooled procurement activities in an effort to save more than a billion dollars annually. Companies looking for growth but seeking lower investment risk can consider a range of transaction structures. Some firms may enter global strategic partnerships with cash-rich players—including state-owned companies, sovereign wealth funds, or PE firms—to identify and develop a portfolio of opportunities within a sector or a market. The global oil corporation BP, the European chemicals maker Borealis, the Brazilian state-owned oil company Petrobras, and the French automaker Renault are among the dozens of companies that have pursued such arrangements over the years. Alternatively, companies might acquire a partial stake in troubled business units of their peers operating in attractive markets. In 2003 the French oil giant Total took a 50% position in Samsung Chemicals through its chemicals unit Atofina, creating Samsung Atofina, to which it transferred technology, operating capabilities, and marketing expertise that jump-started the business’s growth. In some cases firms might jointly acquire third parties, as competitors Votorantim and Suzano did when they bought majority voting control in the Brazilian pulp and paper maker Ripasa during a market downturn. That transaction was structured to maintain the market independence of the two owners, converting Ripasa into a jointly controlled production unit. The agreement also provided the purchasers with the option to acquire additional preferred and common stock of Ripasa within six years. A variety of collaborative ventures can help companies raise capital, lower costs, and position themselves for future growth. A similar strategy is to invest in or partner with innovative suppliers and technology companies. Toyota’s investments and deep partnerships with core parts suppliers in the 1990s were credited with compressing the time necessary to go from concept to production, reducing manufacturing costs, and lowering defects. Similarly, in the 1990s, Samsung Electronics developed a program that nurtured suppliers with financial support and help building their technical capabilities, which led to technology improvements, savings on materials, and shorter order lead times. Today power, chemical, mining, and petroleum companies could set up similar deals, making minority investments in clean-tech, renewable energy, recycling, or autonomous vehicle firms and agreeing to pilot those firms’ technologies in their operations. Such arrangements would allow large incumbents with lower PE ratios to participate in firms with much higher growth prospects and valuations and to speed up their transition to a carbonless future. Yet another approach is to team up with industry peers and adjacent players to create and commercialize new products. Within the chemical sector, companies have been forming consortia and small partnerships to establish standards for, develop, and sell new sustainable technologies. Similar patterns will play out in other sectors; partnerships are especially valuable in disruptive markets and on technology frontiers. Many of these will start as simple nonequity collaborations with an option to convert to a full-scale joint venture once certain technology or financial milestones are passed, as a way to hedge bets and reduce up-front investments.  As an epigram often attributed to Vladimir Lenin goes, “There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.” In 2020 we have lived through a ridiculous number of those weeks. Yet periods of disruption can be rich in opportunity. A strategic examination of your current joint ventures and partnerships and the thoughtful creation of new ones can strengthen your position as you come out of the crisis and help you tap opportunities for growth during the coming rebound."

So we turn to our usual methods of coping with uncertainty–to-do lists and productivity to make progress. But this pause could be our biggest opportunity for growth if we’re willing to be uncomfortable and sit with the loss and not knowing. Being unproductive may just produce the biggest change in ourselves and our outlook on life. The author offers tips for relaxing the demands on our time, thinking, and relationships to give our bodies, minds, and spirits a chance to reorganize and discover who we might become.

Recently, my father died of lymphoma he could no longer fight. “There are few people in this world who leave an indelible mark,” a friend wrote to me, “such that when you reflect upon their essence you can actually see their smile, hear their voice, and feel their presence as though they are there with you in the moment. Your father is among those few.” Every single encounter with him always left you feeling better about yourself. The world has changed; it’s a lesser place without him. I find myself a little lost. I’m scattered. Unfocused. Struggling to be productive. To move forward on anything in a meaningful way. I’m experiencing a very personal loss and sadness right now. But I’m hearing other people describe similar struggles as we all experience this pandemic, this economic collapse, this awakening to the depth of racial injustice. That’s personal too. I really don’t like feeling all this. It makes me anxious. My instinctive drive to push past it kicks in. To plan and to-do list and schedule my way to productivity and achievement and forward progress. That, I know how to do. It’s my comfort during uncertainty. But I also have an opposing impulse, a quieter voice, one that feels deeper, more profound, and even scarier: Stay unproductive. At least for a little while. Feel the sadness, the loss, the change. Sink into the discomfort of not moving forward, not getting things done. In a strange way, not progressing may be its own form of productivity. Something fruitful is happening, we’re just not controlling it. In this moment, being unproductive seems important. I think it’s what I must feel — maybe what we must feel — to allow for growth. To allow ourselves to pause in the liminal space, to linger with a question that this moment begs us to ask: How can I allow myself to be changed? Not, how should I change. Or how must I change to keep up with a changing world. And certainly not, how can I not change and preserve the way things have always been. Those questions come from a habit of relentless productivity and achievement. But they miss what can be magical and transformational about this moment — our real opportunity. Can you allow this change in your world — deeply personal and vastly global — to wash over you, shift your worldview, change you? Not with your discipline or drive, not from a self-directed, strategic, goal-oriented place, but from a place of openness and vulnerability. Not from willfulness but from willingness. And in that pause and openness and vulnerability, can you listen — without defense — to the voices you hear and the nudges you feel? Can you find the emotional courage to follow your inklings, step by step, toward what, even just maybe, feels right? For me, I long to be willing, to be molded by the loss I feel from my father’s death and the grace with which he lived his life. I feel sadness that I will never see his smile again or feel his strong, tender hands on my back. And I also feel excited that when I miss him, I feel him even more, and I can begin — in small ways — to feel my own smile, my own hands, showing up in new ways, more generously, more tenderly, more strongly. We all need emotional courage because being willing to be changed means we must accept and admit that we are not in control and we don’t know. Two things many of us spend our lives scrambling and acquiring and competing and succeeding and workaholic-ing to avoid admitting. It’s disorienting to let go. To realize — to admit — that our control is really only a sense of control. Which is why to slow down rather than speed up, to pause and feel, to approach this moment, with an openness and willingness to be changed, is really, really hard. So what can we do to support ourselves through this moment? That’s actually the wrong question. I have read — and followed — lots of advice about things we can do to slow down and leave space for change: meditation, poetry, walks, journaling, dream-work, and more. But these things can also get in the way because they reflect more doing. It’s trying to solve the problem with the same thinking that created it. Here’s an alternative that has been working for me: Not doing. Or at least, less-doing. There are a few ways I’ve been entering not-doing space that you may want to try. Consider relaxing pressure on: Walk away from your calendar. Leave that space for, literally, nothing. Not a thing. It’s not your writing time or even focused work time. Don’t fill those moments with the busy work of email and to-do lists. Allow yourself time out of time. Allow yourself to dawdle. I went food shopping with one of my daughters and she asked to take a certain road home. “But it will take twice as long!” I protested. “Who cares?” She answered, “It’s a beautiful drive.” And, in every way, it was. Let your mind wander. When you go for a run, don’t listen to a podcast or even music, just run. When you fold the laundry, just fold the laundry. I’m not suggesting “mindfulness,” focusing on each fold as you fold. The opposite, actually. Don’t be mindful — that’s just more control, more pressure, more demand. Instead, let your mind go wherever it goes and, maybe, notice where it goes. If you need a break from seeing people, allow for that. I have lovely, caring friends who have offered runs and conversations and I tell them the truth: I love them but, right now, I want to go running by myself. They understand. And if you do want to be with people, try doing it with curiosity and vulnerability, without wasting effort performing. If you’re listening, don’t judge or solve or offer advice. Just trust that your presence is enough. And if you’re speaking, ask only for an ear. “I don’t want advice,” you can tell them, “I just want to share what’s going on for me.” You’ll be doing them a favor too because you’re releasing them from having to know anything or perform. When you relax the demand on your time, your thinking, and your relationships, you’re slowing down, reducing the load, and leaving space for feelings to come up. Maybe tears, maybe laughter, maybe boredom or annoyance. Maybe you’ll feel the stress of not getting things done, or the fear of missing out as people around you produce and network and market. Maybe you’ll feel joy and that might be scary too. Courageously feel everything without running or repressing or denying or distracting yourself by doing. Give room for your body, your mind, your spirit, to reorganize. Trust that something important is happening — that there is something good on the other side — even if you don’t know what. You can’t force it. But you can sabotage it. It’s hard to trust not-doing when we’re all suffering loss right now. It feels risky. Our doing habits are so strong. I feel the instinct to cling to what I have known and what has kept me safe in the past. But I can also feel myself gingerly loosen my grip on the security of what has been, leaving my hands free, open, reaching for what’s to come. I hope you can be here, with me, in this space for a little while, as we allow ourselves the time and grace to discover who we are and who we are becoming.

"125",125,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/emerging-from-the-crisis","strategy.txt","In times of great uncertainty, it’s difficult to formulate strategies. Leaders can’t draw on experience to address developments no one has ever seen before. Yet the decisions they make now could have ramifications for decades. The practice of strategic foresight offers a solution. Its aim is not to predict the future but to help organizations envision multiple futures in ways that enable them to sense and adapt to change. Its most recognizable tool is scenario planning. To use it well, organizations must imagine a variety of futures, identify strategies that are needed across them, and begin implementing those strategies now. But one-off exercises are not enough: Leaders must institutionalize that process, building a dynamic link between thinking about the future and taking action in the present. In this roundtable discussion, HBR’s editor in chief, Adi Ignatius, leads a conversation among five top executives: the fashion mogul Tory Burch; Geoff Martha, of Medtronic; Nancy McKinstry, who heads the professional information services firm Wolters Kluwer; Chuck Robbins, of Cisco Systems; and Kevin Sneader, of McKinsey & Company. These executives discuss leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic, how the crisis has affected their companies, and how they are responding. They also speculate on what the future might hold for business: more reliance on digital technology, a new relationship with government, and fresh thinking about social inequality, environmental sustainability, and the delivery of health care. The author collaborated with Elisabeth Kübler-Ross on the book On Grief and Grieving, which adapted the five stages of grief from her landmark work in the late 1960s on the five stages of dying: denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, and acceptance. He has since come to believe that grief has a sixth stage—meaning—which can take many forms: remembering the joy that someone or something gave; rituals of remembrance; gratitude; or turning the loss into something positive for others. In this article Kessler advises leaders, managers, and organizations to recognize that people may be experiencing different kinds of grief and to treat them accordingly. The complete Spotlight package is available in a single reprint. Good strategy creates competitive advantage over time, but the uncertainty of the future makes it difficult to identify effective courses of action, particularly in the midst of a crisis. As a leader, how can you prepare for an unpredictable future while managing the urgent demands of the present? The practice of strategic foresight provides the capacity to sense, shape, and adapt to change as it happens. One important element of the practice is scenario planning, which helps leaders navigate uncertainty by teaching them how to anticipate possible futures while still operating in the present. To make effective strategy in the face of uncertainty, leaders need to institutionalize strategic foresight, harnessing the power of imagination to build a dynamic link between planning and operations. How can we formulate strategy in the  face of uncertainty? That’s the fundamental question leaders must ask as they prepare for the future. And in the midst of a global pandemic, answering it has never felt more urgent. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, rapid technological change, growing economic interdependence, and mounting political instability had conspired to make the future increasingly murky. Uncertainty was so all-encompassing that to fully capture the dimensions of the problem, researchers had devised elaborate acronyms such as VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) and TUNA (turbulent, uncertain, novel, and ambiguous). In response, many leaders sought refuge in the more predictable short term—a mechanism for coping with uncertainty that research has shown leaves billions of dollars of earnings on the table and millions of people needlessly unemployed. By the start of 2020, the sense of uncertainty was so pervasive that many executives were doubling down on efficiency at the expense of innovation, favoring the present at the expense of the future. And then the pandemic hit. Now the tyranny of the present is supreme. A lot of organizations have had no choice but to focus on surviving immediate threats. (There are no futurists in foxholes.) But many business and political discussions still demand farsightedness. The stakes are high, and decisions that leaders make now may have ramifications for years—or even decades. As they try to manage their way through the crisis, they need a way to link current moves to future outcomes. So how best to proceed? Strategic foresight—the history, theory, and practice of which I have spent years researching—offers a way forward. Its aim is not to predict the future but rather to make it possible to imagine multiple futures in creative ways that heighten our ability to sense, shape, and adapt to what happens in the years ahead. Strategic foresight doesn’t help us figure out what to think about the future. It helps us figure out how to think about it. To be sure, a growing body of research has demonstrated that it is possible to make more-accurate predictions, even in chaotic fields like geopolitics. We should use those techniques to the extent we can. But when predictive tools reach their limits, we need to turn to strategic foresight, which takes the irreducible uncertainty of the future as a starting point. In that distinctive context, it helps leaders make better decisions. The most recognizable tool of strategic foresight is scenario planning. It involves several stages: identifying forces that will shape future market and operating conditions; exploring how those drivers may interact; imagining a variety of plausible futures; revising mental models of the present on the basis of those futures; and then using those new models to devise strategies that prepare organizations for whatever the future actually brings. Today the use of scenarios is widespread. But all too often, organizations conduct just a single exercise and then set whatever they learn from it on the shelf. If companies want to make effective strategy in the face of uncertainty, they need to set up a process of constant exploration—one that allows top managers to build permanent but flexible bridges between their actions in the present and their thinking about the future. What’s necessary, in short, is not just imagination but the institutionalization of imagination. That is the essence of strategic foresight. Uncertainty stems from our inability to compare the present to anything we’ve previously experienced. When situations lack analogies to the past, we have trouble envisioning how they will play out in the future. The economist Frank Knight famously argued that uncertainty is best understood in contrast with risk. In situations of risk, Knight wrote, we can calculate the probability of particular outcomes, because we have seen many similar situations before. (A life insurance company, for example, has data on enough 45-year-old, nonsmoking white men to estimate how long one of them is going to live.) But in situations of uncertainty—and Knight put most business decisions in this category—we can only guess what might happen, because we lack the experience to gauge the most likely outcome. In fact, we might not even be able to imagine the range of potential outcomes. The key in those situations, Knight felt, was judgment. Managers with good judgment can successfully chart a course through uncertainty despite a lack of reference points. Unfortunately, Knight had no idea where good judgment came from. He called it an “unfathomable mystery.” Of course, in something of a catch-22, conventional wisdom holds that to a large extent good judgment is based on experience. And in many uncertain situations managers do, in fact, turn to historical analogy to anticipate the future. This is why business schools use the case teaching method: It’s a way of exposing students to a range of analogies—and thus ostensibly helping them develop judgment—much more quickly than is possible in the normal course of life. When situations lack analogies to the past, it’s hard to envision the future. But Knight’s point was that uncertainty is marked by novelty, which, by definition, lacks antecedents. At the very moment when the present least resembles the past, it makes little sense to look back in time for clues about the future. In times of uncertainty, we run up against the limits of experience, so we must look elsewhere for judgment. That’s where strategic foresight comes in. In the United States, strategic foresight can be traced back to the RAND Corporation, a think tank that the U.S. Air Force set up after World War II. Rather than plumbing the mystery of judgment, RAND scholars hoped to replace it with the “rational” tools of quantitative analysis. But as they grappled with the military demands of the postwar world, they could not escape the fact that nuclear weapons had fundamentally changed the nature of warfare. Two countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, had acquired the ability to destroy each other as functioning civilizations. And because no one had ever fought a nuclear war before, no one knew how best to fight (or avoid) one. One RAND analyst, who approached the problem of a potential apocalypse with a glee that made him a model for Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, was a mathematician named Herman Kahn. In the atomic age, Kahn realized, military strategists faced uncertainty to an absolutely unprecedented degree. “Nuclear war is still (and hopefully will remain) so far from our experience,” he wrote, “that it is difficult to reason from, or illustrate arguments by, analogies from history.” How, then, Kahn asked, could military strategists develop the judgment crucial to making decisions about an uncertain future? It was the very question Knight had posed, but unlike Knight, Kahn had an answer: “ersatz experience.” What strategists needed, he suggested, were “strange aids to thought,” in the form of multiple imagined futures that could be developed through simulations such as war games and scenarios. Marc Piasecki/Getty Images In 1961, Kahn left RAND to help found the Hudson Institute, where he eventually shared his ideas with Pierre Wack, an executive from Royal Dutch Shell. In the early 1970s Wack famously applied Kahn’s ideas in the business world, by devising scenarios to help Shell prepare for what might take place as the oil-rich nations of the Middle East began to assert themselves on the world stage. When change did come, in the form of the price shocks induced by the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, Shell was able to ride the crisis out much better than its competitors. (In 1985, Wack chronicled Shell’s efforts in two articles for this magazine: “Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead” and “Scenarios: Shooting the Rapids.”) The Shell exercises marked the birth of scenario planning as a strategic tool for business managers. In subsequent years, Wack’s successors at the company refined his method, and scenario planners from Shell went on to become some of the most prominent scholars and practitioners in the field. Nonetheless, few of the organizations that have conducted scenario-planning exercises in recent decades have institutionalized them as part of a broader effort to achieve strategic foresight. One of the rare exceptions is the U.S. Coast Guard, which describes its work with scenario planning as part of a “cycle of strategic renewal.” As such, it offers a model that many organizations can learn from. One might ask how relevant the Coast Guard’s experience is for businesses, but in fact it constitutes what social scientists call a “crucial-case test.” As a military service, the Coast Guard has less organizational flexibility than most private firms, with a mission mandated by statute and a budget determined by Congress. What’s more, for a long time its need to react daily to numerous emerging situations—from ships in distress to drug interdictions—forced it to focus almost exclusively on the short term, leaving it with little bandwidth to formulate strategy for the long term. Nevertheless, in recent years it has managed to leverage scenario planning to its advantage, reorienting the organization in an ongoing way toward the future. And that, in turn, has allowed it to respond and adapt to disruptive changes, such as those that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks. On that tragic morning, hundreds of thousands of people found themselves trapped in Lower Manhattan, desperate to escape the burning chaos that was Ground Zero. While some were able to walk uptown or across bridges, which officials had closed to vehicles, for many the best way off the island was by water. So over the next hours, an impromptu flotilla—of ferries, tugs, private craft, and fire and police boats—took clusters of people away from the wreckage of the World Trade Center and across the water to safety. Although many vessels operated on their own initiative, a significant part of the evacuation was directed by the Coast Guard, which had issued a call for “all available boats” and coordinated the chaotic debarkation with remarkable poise, creativity, and efficiency. The effort reminded many of the storied British evacuation across the English Channel of several hundred thousand troops that Nazi forces had trapped in Dunkirk, on the coast of France. That the Coast Guard rose to the challenge is no surprise. Although it has a broad set of responsibilities, ranging from search-and-rescue to environmental protection to port security, the organization’s motto is Semper paratus, or “Always ready,” and it prides itself on responding to emergencies. As one retired captain told me, “Our whole idea is, when the alarm goes off, to be able to fly into action.” But September 11 ended up being more than a short-term challenge. In its aftermath, the Coast Guard found its mission quickly expanding. Within a day it was tasked with implementing radically heightened port-security measures around the country: Port security had previously accounted for 1% to 2% of its daily operational load, but it soon consumed 50% to 60%. In March 2003 the Coast Guard was integrated into the new Department of Homeland Security, and that same month it was given the job of securing ports and waterways all over Iraq, following the U.S.-led invasion. In subsequent years the service’s budget would double and its ranks would swell. A new future had arrived. The Coast Guard adapted to this future nimbly—and did so in part because in the late 1990s it had conducted a scenario-planning exercise called Project Long View, which was designed to help the organization contend with “a startlingly complex future operating environment characterized by new or unfamiliar security threats.” Its aim, in effect, was to future-proof the Coast Guard. The service ran Long View in 1998 and 1999—and then, in 2003, in response to the shocks of September 11, renamed it Project Evergreen and began running it every four years. Ever since, the organization has relied on Evergreen to help its leaders think and act strategically. When the Coast Guard decided to launch Long View, it enlisted the help of the Futures Strategy Group (FSG), a consultancy specializing in scenario planning. FSG maintains that uncertainty precludes prediction but demands anticipation—and that imaginatively and rigorously exploring plausible futures can facilitate decision-making. Working with FSG, the Coast Guard identified four forces for change that would have a significant impact on its future: the role of the federal government, the strength of the U.S. economy, the seriousness of threats to U.S. society, and the demand for maritime services. By exploring them and looking forward some 20 years, the team came up with 16 possible “far-future worlds” in which the Coast Guard might have to operate. Of those, Coast Guard leaders selected five that were as distinct as possible from one another (while remaining plausible) and represented the range of environments the service might face. FSG then wrote detailed descriptions of those futures and the fictional events that led to them. Each future world was given a name intended to capture its essence. “Taking on Water” described a future in which the U.S. economy struggled amid significant environmental degradation. In “Pax Americana,” a humbled United States had to contend with a world rent by political instability and economic catastrophe. “Planet Enterprise” was dominated by giant transnational corporations. “Pan-American Highway” featured regional trade blocs oriented around the dollar and the euro. And “Balkanized America” presciently warned of a divided world in which “terrorism strikes with frightening frequency, and increasingly close to home.” NurPhoto/Getty Images Using those scenarios, the Coast Guard convened a three-day workshop, which FSG facilitated. Teams of civilians and officers were assigned to different future worlds and charged with devising strategies that would enable the Coast Guard to operate effectively in them. At the end of the workshop the teams compared notes on what they had come up with. Strategies that appeared again and again, across different teams, were deemed “robust.” In their final report the organizers of Long View listed 10 of these strategies, ranging from the creation of a more unified command structure to the development of a more flexible human-resources system to the establishment of “full maritime domain awareness”—which the Coast Guard defines as the “ability to acquire, track, and identify in real time any vessel or aircraft entering America’s maritime domain.” All of these strategies, they argued, would help the Coast Guard carry out its mission, no matter what the future held. Many of the strategies weren’t novel. But Long View allowed participants to think about them in new ways that proved crucial in the post–September 11 world. In effect, Long View allowed the Coast Guard to pressure-test strategies under a range of plausible futures, prioritize the most-promising ones, and socialize them among the leadership—which meant that after the attacks, when the organization found its mission changing dramatically, it was able to respond quickly. Launching Long View and subsequently establishing Evergreen as a continuous process wasn’t easy. It took exceptionally strong leadership—in particular from admirals James Loy and Thad Allen. The program has also faced challenges in implementing ideas; there is a difference between strategic foresight and strategic execution. But once established, the program developed significant momentum, fueled in part by a growing cadre of alumni who saw the value of a dynamic relationship between the present and the future. The Coast Guard had institutionalized imagination. Long View and Evergreen weren’t designed to bring about a wholesale organizational shift from the operational to the strategic or to train the Coast Guard’s attention primarily on the long term. Instead, the goal was to get its personnel thinking about the future in a way that would inform and improve their ability to operate in the present. That was no small challenge. Management scholars have long noted that, in order to survive and thrive over time, organizations need to both exploit existing competencies and explore new ones. They need to be “ambidextrous.” The problem is that those two imperatives compete for resources, demand distinct ways of thinking, and require different organizational structures. Doing one makes it harder to do the other. Ambidexterity requires managers to somehow resolve this paradox. Long View and Evergreen helped the service’s leaders do that. The programs didn’t reduce the organization’s ability to attend to the present. If anything, the opposite occurred. Exploration enabled exploitation. The Coast Guard members I interviewed for my research reported that Long View and Evergreen accomplished this in several ways. At the most explicit level, they identified strategies that the Coast Guard then pursued. Take maritime domain awareness. The scenarios made it clear to Coast Guard leaders that in any plausible future, they would want the ability to identify and track every vessel in U.S. waters. Although this may seem like an obvious need, it’s not a capability that the service had in the 1990s. As one retired admiral explained, “Ships could come in 10 miles off or even three miles off the United States’ coast, and we might not know it.” That was in part because U.S. agencies had no integrated system for gathering and disseminating information.  Even though the Coast Guard didn’t have the organizational and technological infrastructure to establish full maritime domain awareness immediately, Long View built consensus about its value among top leadership, which helped the service implement it more quickly after 9/11. In fact, the Coast Guard captain who had managed Evergreen led the interagency effort to develop the first National Strategy for Maritime Security, which ultimately prompted the creation of the Nationwide Automatic Identification System—a sort of transponder system for ships. The strategies that emerged from the scenario-planning exercises also enabled personnel who participated in them to act with a greater awareness of the service’s future needs. For example, the first iteration of Evergreen stressed the importance of building strategic partnerships at home and abroad. With this in mind, one senior Coast Guard leader prepared for threats that might emerge in the Pacific by developing bilateral relationships with island nations there; sharing information, coordinating patrols, and holding joint exercises with counterparts in China, Russia, Canada, South Korea, and Japan; and finding ways to work more closely with other U.S. agencies, from the FBI to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the most basic level, Long View and Evergreen simply got the service’s people to think more about the future. The master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard Reserve described how Evergreen had changed his thinking, citing a recent conversation with a colleague: “He and I were here in my office this morning, talking about, ‘Twenty-five years from now, what is the Coast Guard Reserve component going to look like?’” Before taking part in Evergreen, he added, “I just wouldn’t understand how to think that way.” Perhaps most interesting, however—and most important in resolving the supposed paradox between exploration and exploitation—is the way that Long View and Evergreen helped participants understand the demands of the past and the future not as competing but as complementary. The exercises changed the very way in which participants thought about time. Humans tend to conceive of time as linear and unidirectional, as moving from past to present to future, with each time frame discrete. We remember yesterday; we experience today; we anticipate tomorrow. But the best scenario planning embraces a decidedly nonlinear conception of time. That’s what Long View and Evergreen did: They took stock of trends in the present, jumped many years into the future, described plausible worlds created by those drivers, worked backward to develop stories about how those worlds had come to pass, and then worked forward again to develop robust strategies. In this model, time circles around on itself, in a constantly evolving feedback cycle between present and future. In a word, it is a loop. Once participants began to view time as a loop, they understood thinking about the future as an essential component of taking action in the present. The scenarios gave them a structure that strengthened their ability to be strategic, despite tremendous uncertainty. It became clear that in making decisions, Coast Guard personnel should learn not only from past experience but also from imagined futures. The prospect of organizing a scenario exercise can intimidate the uninitiated. There are distinct benefits to enlisting one of the individuals, boutique consultancies, or even large firms that specialize in scenarios to provide helpful direction. However, regardless of who runs the process, managers should follow these key guidelines: One of the chief purposes of a scenario exercise is to challenge mental models of how the world works. To create the conditions for success, you’ll need to bring together participants who have significantly different organizational roles, points of view, and personal experiences. You’ll also need people who represent what Kees van der Heijden, one of Wack’s successors at Shell, has described as the three powers necessary for any effective conversation about strategy: the power to perceive, the power to think, and the power to act. The best scenario planning embraces a decidedly nonlinear conception of time. It’s important to explicitly articulate the assumptions in your current strategy and what future you expect will result from its implementation. Think of this scenario as your projected scenario—but recognize that it’s just one of many possible futures, and focus on determining which assumptions it would be helpful to revisit. Rafael Ramirez, who leads the Oxford Scenarios Programme, advises that in doing this you disaggregate transactional actors, which you can influence or control, from environmental forces, which you cannot. How might those forces combine to create different possible futures? This can be the most difficult part of the exercise, particularly for those used to more analytical modes of thinking. Push yourself to imagine what the future will look like in five, 10, or even 20 years—without simply extrapolating from trends in the present. This takes a high degree of creativity and also requires the judgment to distinguish a scenario that, as the Coast Guard puts it, pushes the envelope of plausibility from one that tears it—an inherently subjective task. Good facilitators can both prime the imagination and maintain the guardrails of reality. Scenario planning is most effective when it’s an immersive experience. Creating “artifacts from the future,” such as fictional newspaper articles or even video clips, often helps challenge existing mental models. It’s also a good idea to disconnect participants from the present, so hold workshops off-site and discourage the use of phones at them. Form teams to inhabit each of your far-future worlds, and give them this challenge: What should we be doing now that would enable us to operate better in that particular future? Create an atmosphere in which even junior participants can put forward ideas without hesitation. Once the groups develop strategies for their worlds, bring them together to compare notes. Look for commonalities, single them out, and identify plans and investments that will make sense across a range of futures. This may sound obvious, but it is the place where most companies fall down. Using scenario planning to devise strategies isn’t resource-intensive, but implementing them requires commitment. To couple foresight with action, leaders should set up a formal system in which managers have to explain explicitly how their plans will advance the firm’s new strategies. Realistically, foresight will not drive every initiative, but scenario exercises can still be valuable in several ways. First, they can provide participants with a common language to talk about the future. Second, they can build support for an idea within an organization so that when the need for implementation becomes clear, it can move faster. Finally, they can enable participants to act at the unit level, even if the organization as a whole fails to link the present and future as tightly as it should. In the long run you’ll reap the greatest value from scenario exercises by establishing an iterative cycle—that is, a process that continually orients your organization toward the future while keeping an eye on the present, and vice versa. This ambidexterity will allow you to thrive under the best of conditions—and it’s essential for survival under the worst. Moving in a loop between the present and multiple imagined futures helps you to adjust and update your strategies continually. This last point is critical. As the current pandemic has made clear, needs and assumptions can change quickly and unpredictably. Preparing for the future demands constant reappraisal. Strategic foresight—the capacity to sense, shape, and adapt to what happens—requires iterative exploration, whether through scenario planning or another method. (See “The Future: A Glossary.”) Only by institutionalizing the imaginative process can organizations establish a continual give-and-take between the present and the future. Used dynamically in this way, scenario planning and other tools of strategic foresight allow us to map ever-shifting territory. Managing the uncertainty of the future requires many tools, some of which have similar or even overlapping functions. To cut through the confusion, here’s a brief guide. Backcasting asks participants to work backward in time from a particular future to ascertain what in the present caused its emergence. The practice is most often used to identify a path to a preferred future but can also be used to avoid steps toward a negative future. “Premortems,” for example, aim to identify the causes of a hypothetical future failure. Contingency planning aids decision-making by preparing participants for specific events that are considered possible or even likely. A contingency plan provides a playbook in case of emergency. Crisis simulations and tabletop exercises have participants respond to specific scenarios and then analyze their actions, to help people prepare for real-life situations. They differ from war games in that they involve a specific possible future rather than a range of plausible futures. Forecasting involves making probabilistic predictions about the future and, as such, is a tool that practitioners of strategic foresight tend to avoid. But it, too, has its place in helping strategists manage uncertainty, adding a quantitative angle to the qualitative methods preferred by, say, scenario planners. The best approach is this: Predict what you can; imagine what you cannot; and develop the judgment to know the difference. Horizon scanning asks participants to search for “weak signals” of change in the present with an eye toward monitoring their development and assessing their potential impact. The practice is guided by the idea that the future often first comes into view in places that most of us are not paying attention to, such as specialized scientific journals. Scenario planning uses stories about alternative futures to challenge assumptions and reframe perceptions of the present. The process does not attempt to predict the future but instead aims to explore plausible futures to inform strategy. Trend analysis asks participants to consider the potential influence of patterns of change that are already visible. A popular structured approach is the STEEP framework, which disaggregates patterns of change into five categories: social, technological, economic, environmental, and political. War games ask participants to engage an opponent in simulated conflict, often to explore reactions to novel circumstances. Like scenario planning, war games do not attempt to predict what will happen; rather, they project what could happen, thereby providing insight into decision-making. Despite the name, war games can address far more than just the military aspects of conflict. Of course, strategic foresight also enables us to identify opportunities and amplifies our ability to seize them. Organizations don’t just prepare for the future. They make it. Moments of uncertainty hold great entrepreneurial potential. As Wack once wrote in these pages, “It is precisely in these contexts—not in stable times—that the real opportunities lie to gain competitive advantage through strategy.” It takes strength to stand up against the tyranny of the present and invest in imagination. Strategic foresight makes both possible—and offers leaders a chance for legacy. After all, they will be judged not only by what they do today but by how well they chart a course toward tomorrow.

She’d been excited about her new role as a program manager at Rescue, the oldest and largest aid organization fighting global poverty. She’d risen early; walked her dogs; eaten breakfast with her boyfriend, Mateo; packed a lunch; and still managed to get to the office before 9:00. She’d thought arriving early would make a good impression.   When Mia walked into the lobby, she saw a few familiar faces from her previous visit, but the receptionist was the only one to greet her. His name was Anthony, and although she thought they’d bonded last time, he looked up at her quizzically. “Can I help you?” he asked. “It’s great to see you again,” Mia said. “I’m Mia, the new program manager.” “Oh, right,” Anthony said, unsmiling. “Take a seat, and I’ll give you some paperwork to fill out while I grab your manager. It’s Michael, right?” Mia had been in the building for less than five minutes and already she felt discouraged. Things didn’t improve from there. Anthony couldn’t find Michael, so he escorted her back to a dim room full of cubicles. The one person already there, a support team coordinator named Jessie Carbone, introduced herself quickly, explained that IT hadn’t set up Mia’s desk yet, suggested that she sit at a vacant workstation, and went back to typing. At 10:30 Michael finally stopped by to hand Mia a stack of reading material and explain that his day was packed but he hoped to catch up with her later that afternoon. He never did.1 Mia spent five hours coordinating with HR and IT via her cell phone and personal email account. She ate lunch at the borrowed desk. A few other employees came in and out during the day, and she smiled warmly and waved, but no one seemed to know who she was. Finally a technician arrived with a laptop and a monitor, which he installed at the desk farthest from the window. Mia found herself thinking wistfully about her previous workplace, Azzurro, a start-up that used IoT-enabled container sensors to help retail businesses better manage waste. She’d joined it just after graduating from the University of Bologna with a degree in international management and had been promoted to business analyst in less than four years. She liked the work and the people. But then she met Saul Rizzo, a senior HR director at Rescue, at a networking event. He mentioned a role at the organization’s new outpost in Bologna—one of its 92 offices worldwide—and Mia was immediately intrigued. The job would include setting up data and reporting systems and working with a seasoned Rescue manager to outline critical business processes and identify key performance indicators. At an interview a few weeks later, Saul had offered her a salary nearly double what Azzurro was paying her and promised that she would not only have a personal growth plan but also be able to work on the ground once a month helping populations in crisis. It had seemed like a no-brainer to make the move. Mateo agreed. Now, considering whether she should book a meeting with Michael for the next day—basically forcing him to onboard her properly—Mia wondered if she’d made the right decision.2 Just then she got a text from Mateo: “How was it???” She replied with a thumbs-down emoji and “I need a drink. Let’s meet at the usual spot.” “It was a disaster,” Mia said after recounting her workday. Mateo nodded empathetically. “Do you think I made a mistake? I mean, I really liked Azzurro, but the humanitarian work sold me on Rescue.” “Don’t forget the pay!” Mateo said jokingly. Mia sighed. As the primary breadwinner in their household (Mateo was a struggling artist), she was already feeling the pressure.3 “Seriously, though,” he went on. “It’s too early to know. It’s such a different culture, and Rescue is a huge organization. How many employees did Azzurro have?” “A hundred,” she said. “Rescue has thousands.” “Right. And they’re just setting up this branch. It may be a particularly chaotic time.”4 “It’s just so weird to have no official welcome, no onboarding, not even any real assignment. I’ve spoken with Michael only twice—on the phone during the interview process and very briefly this morning. You’d think he’d want to at least have a conversation with me on my first day.” “I’m sure it was an anomaly,” Mateo said. “Tomorrow will be better. Rescue is reputable, and on paper this is a good career move.” “I know, I know. You’re right.” Mia gulped her wine. She just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The following afternoon Mia finally met with Michael. “Mia, welcome,” he said brusquely. “Sorry I couldn’t get to you earlier—I’ve been tied up in strategy meetings. As you can see, we’re still getting our systems in order. Let’s talk about your first project.” He said he wanted her to audit the processes of three departments—warehouse, supply chain, and delivery—that were essential to Rescue’s missions. Each unit combined employees transferred from other Rescue offices and recent hires brought in to help experiment with new strategies. Mia’s job was to see whether those strategies were more efficient than Rescue’s current ones. The assignment was not what she had expected, but she nodded and smiled. “Anything else?” Michael asked, turning back to his laptop. “Actually,” Mia said, “when I was recruited, Saul mentioned that I’d have a chance to participate in some field projects.” Michael looked surprised—and a little annoyed. “Hmm. I don’t mean to disappoint you, Mia, but that’s not what I had in mind for this position. We’re just building this operation, and we need internal staff members to stay focused on their responsibilities here.” He shook his head. “I’m sorry, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon.” “OK,” Mia said, trying to hide her dismay.5 Mia spent the next three weeks toiling away at the auditing project, but it wasn’t easy. Michael had forgotten to introduce her to a few department heads, so although some were friendly and forthcoming, others ignored her repeated emails or only reluctantly shared information. She’d asked Michael for advice several times, but he’d basically blown her off. And when her work was finished, it took her five days to get half an hour with him to present her findings. He’d been complimentary but then asked her to track some new metrics. She asked about broadening the scope of her duties, but his phone rang, and he waved her away. “Sorry, I have to take this. Let’s discuss next time we meet.”6 Desperate to confide in someone besides Mateo, Mia asked Jessie if she’d ever had any problems getting Michael’s attention. “It’s not his fault,” Jessie said. “It’s this organization. It’s just such a bureaucracy. He has to run every new idea up the food chain. We’re always short-staffed because they’re always opening new offices. And they move people around so much that everyone’s constantly in learning mode, trying to get up to speed on a new geography. Don’t get me wrong—we do amazing work out in the field. We do help people. But inside, it’s a slog.”7 “Do you ever get involved in that outside work?” Mia asked. “Oh, no. We’re the back office. Our job is to help the people who are experts at fieldwork do theirs.” Her heart sank. Mia decided she’d email Saul and request a video call. To her surprise, he replied within the hour and said he had 30 minutes free at 5:00. Mia was determined to be up-front about her disappointment. She outlined how unnecessarily difficult her initial assignment had been and how rarely she interacted with Michael, even though she thought part of her job was to partner with him on performance indicators. “Plus he doesn’t seem open to my doing any direct humanitarian work, even though that was a big pull for me,” she said. Saul looked concerned. “I know, and I mentioned that to him. My sense is that the audits are just the first step and that you’ll get into the more interesting work soon. He may have forgotten our discussion because things are so hectic right now.” He asked her to be patient and promised to talk with Michael. “We’re lucky you’re here, Mia. Let’s see if we can turn things around.”8 That evening Mia was doing the dishes after dinner when her phone signaled a new email. It was from Michael. She called Mateo into the kitchen to hear the message: “Dear Mia, I’m writing to let you know that I spoke with Saul this evening. We discussed your role and the misalignments that resulted in a negative experience for you. Given the demands of my role, it’s difficult for me to meet regularly with all the members of my team, but I’m happy to set up a weekly check-in to support you. There are certain tasks that will greatly benefit the organization that I’d like you to stick with. But there may be other responsibilities we can add that would be more in line with your interests. Best regards, Michael” “Hmm,” Mateo said. “Is he sorry for being such a bad boss since you started, or is he angry at you for talking to Saul?” “I’m not sure,” Mia replied. “He’s saying the right things, but it’s such a cold, formal email, so I can’t help feeling that he sent it only because he got in trouble. Maybe going over Michael’s head was a mistake.”9 “Well, you’ve tried talking to Michael and didn’t get anywhere. And it’s clear he didn’t understand what Saul promised you, so they needed to have a conversation. Even if he’s saying all this under duress, at least he’s saying it.” “But can I trust him? Can I trust the organization? It has such a great reputation, but from the inside it seems like a mess.” Mateo hugged her. “You’ve never been the kind of person to settle,” he said. “If it’s that bad, maybe it’s time to cut your losses.” “And do what? I need a job.” “Of course. We rely on your income. But what did your boss say when you left Azzurro? She said you could always come back.” “Doesn’t everyone say that?” “No. They loved you there.” Mia smiled, but she was still conflicted. “I guess I could reach out to recruiters, too.” “See—you have options.” “I know. I need to think more about what I’m going to do.” “Well, I’m here to talk whenever you need to. I’ll support your decision.” IF YOU DON’T like your current situation, you have the power to change it. I would encourage Mia to actively start looking for another job. She needs to reframe her negative experience at Rescue as an opportunity to consider what will really make her happy. Does she want to be more involved in a career track that includes fieldwork? Is an office environment with natural light and standing desks (as opposed to a dark space filled with cubicles) important for her mental health? We already know she’s a marketable candidate. She was recruited and offered twice her salary to work at a respected nonprofit. And because she has a steady income, she has time to be strategic and consider other job options. Looking for a job is like a job in itself, but it will be worth it if Mia can find one better suited to her goals and personal needs. I experienced a similar situation. A few years ago I joined a prestigious news outlet. Like Rescue, it was a large organization with serious bureaucracy problems. Processes weren’t streamlined, and people needed approvals at many levels to get things done. This lack of agility meant that the organization struggled with employee development. As a result, my manager and I had different expectations regarding my role. Mia is facing the same thing. In a bureaucracy, without a supportive boss, it can take months, even years, for the situation to change. And Michael’s icy email implies that he already resents Mia for going over his head—a red flag that suggests he may not be open to change. Even if his reasons are justified, their relationship will probably continue to be emotionally exhausting for Mia. What Mia can control is how she reacts. She can think about what she’s looking for in a work environment and culture and outline where she wants to be in five to 10 years. She can update her résumé and craft a story to explain her short time at Rescue. I’d recommend that she tell an honest one: “I was recruited, but in the end there were some misalignments between the role I was told I’d be taking on and the work I was doing.” She doesn’t need to go into a lot of detail. I left the news outlet years ago and found a job at a much smaller company that was a better cultural fit. I was also given more leadership opportunities, which allowed me to launch my long-term career. Later on I learned that the structural problems at the news outlet ended up hurting the business because it couldn’t keep up with changing technologies. If Mia stays at Rescue, she risks spinning her wheels and halting her professional development. She needs to be a self-starter and put her happiness first. MIA SHOULD STICK with Rescue for a bit longer. She is only a month in and needs to give it more time. Change always comes with some challenges. I’d encourage her to revisit what originally drove her to take this role. First, the organization is very much more in alignment with her interest in humanitarian work than Azzurro was. And although she is understandably excited by the prospect of actually working in the field, she will soon learn how crucial internal support staff members like her are to making this work possible. Nonprofits today depend on strong data and analytics to remain competitive in their fields and to present valid, evidence-based reporting to their partners. Second, this role is more challenging than her previous one was. She is taking on new and different responsibilities, which naturally come with a period of discomfort. But that’s normal. At the end of the day, this job is going to stretch her in ways that her previous role didn’t. She will walk away with a much broader skill set in a field she is passionate about. Without putting the blame on anyone in particular, it appears that there were some failures in the interview process that have led to a misalignment between Mia’s expectations and Michael’s. It doesn’t seem to me that this is the result of poor leadership or an issue of organizational structure, either of which would be of greater concern. As written, Mia’s job description—setting up data systems and identifying key performance indicators—is a very internal one. If we could go back a month, I would caution her to take a closer look at what exactly she was being hired to do and to clarify her day-to-day responsibilities. For example, “Does identifying KPIs mean I’d be going into the field, or would that work take place in the office?” What Mia can do now is revisit that job description to see whether it matches the tasks she’s been assigned so far. Recruiters do sometimes make promises to expand roles when they are trying to draw in candidates. Since Mia was indeed promised fieldwork by Saul, Michael has a responsibility to follow through. When and how that will happen needs to be made clear. It’s a good sign that Michael addressed this issue head-on, even if he did so in an email. He may have been doing it grudgingly, but he seemed to be offering Mia an olive branch and a chance for the two of them to get on the same page. If Mia chooses to stick it out for at least six months, she can take small, proactive steps to improve her situation. It is Michael’s responsibility to make time for weekly check-ins, but it is Mia’s responsibility to set the agenda for those meetings. Before going into them, she should outline what she wants to discuss, including questions she has about upcoming projects and how to overcome challenges she may be facing. She needs to take the initiative to get guidance from Michael rather than waiting for him to offer it. Even if we weren’t in the midst of an economic downturn, I’d advise Mia to stay on for now. If she is still unhappy in the role after six months, maybe she does need to think about other possibilities. But she will walk away with a stronger résumé and a better skill set, which will position her to have more options.

While that approach may work in a lot of instances, complex deals demand a much more strategic approach. The best negotiators look beyond their immediate counterparts to see if other constituencies have a stake in the deal’s outcome or value to contribute; rethink the scope and timing of talks; and search for connections across multiple deals. They also get creative about the process and framing of negotiations, ditching the binary thinking that can lock negotiators into unproductive zero-sum postures. Applying such strategic techniques will allow dealmakers to find novel sources of leverage, realize bigger opportunities, and achieve outcomes that maximize value for both sides. Negotiators often mainly react to the other side’s moves. But for complex deals, a proactive approach is needed. Strategic negotiators look beyond their immediate counterpart for stakeholders who can influence the deal. They intentionally control the scope and timing of talks, search for novel sources of leverage, and seek connections across multiple deals. Tactical negotiating can lock parties into a zero-sum posture, in which the goal is to capture as much value from the other side as possible. Well-thought-out strategies suppress the urge to react to moves or to take preemptive action based on fears about the other side’s intentions. They lead to deals that maximize value for both sides. When we advise our clients on negotiations,  we often ask them how they intend to formulate a negotiation strategy. Most reply that they’ll do some planning before engaging with their counterparts—for instance, by identifying each side’s best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) or by researching the other party’s key interests. But beyond that, they feel limited in how well they can prepare. What we hear most often is “It depends on what the other side does.”   Fair enough. For most routine negotiations, a reactive approach is sufficient. When the stakes are low, skilled negotiators can pivot with relative ease from one tactic to another as the opposite side makes moves, and often that’s enough to ensure that the final deal fully captures value for them. But from time to time dealmakers find themselves in complex negotiations with higher stakes. In those situations they require a much more robust approach. Just like business, political, and military leaders, negotiators need a strategic framework that illuminates the key choices they must make to achieve their ultimate objectives. In the 30 years we’ve spent as advisers on hundreds of negotiations, ranging from agreements to resolve armed conflict to multibillion-dollar commercial deals, we have codified what makes negotiation strategies effective. Negotiators should start developing them well before the initiation of talks, but the process is dynamic and iterative and should continue until the final deal is inked—and in some cases beyond. With well-thought-out strategies, negotiators can suppress the urge to react to counterparts or to make preemptive moves that are based on fears about the other side’s intentions. They’ll be able to prepare for the worst but not trigger it—and to identify the actions most likely to have a significant impact on deal outcomes. Here are the key strategic principles negotiators should apply to their next complex deal. People tend to pursue deals with the obvious parties. If we’re sellers, we search for a buyer; if we’re borrowers, we search for a lender. But we often overlook many others in the ecosystem surrounding the negotiation: our competitors, suppliers, and customers—and their competitors, suppliers, and customers. We need an approach that encompasses all the parties that can and will help us fulfill our objectives. To devise one, negotiators should answer the following questions: Consider how the holder of key patents necessary to play movies and music on DVDs sought to prevent low-cost manufacturers in China from infringing on its intellectual property (and competing unfairly with its duly licensed partners). Initially, it tried to negotiate with those manufacturers, but in most cases it was simply ignored. And even when the Chinese manufacturers were successfully challenged and subjected to a legal process, they would simply close shop and then reopen under a different name. Working backward from the desired outcome (halting sales of infringing products in significant markets), the patent holder realized that although it couldn’t dissuade manufacturers from making unlicensed DVD players, it could persuade large importers and distributors to stop buying and selling those products. By helping the importers and distributors recognize the infringement and intellectual property issues, the patent owner got them on the same side of what would otherwise have been a steep uphill negotiation with the unauthorized manufacturers. In high-stakes negotiations, dealmakers tend to talk about how much power and leverage the other side has, what the other side will or won’t agree to, and how to influence its behavior. While viewing counterparts as if they were one monolithic entity is convenient, that attitude regularly leads to analytical and strategic missteps. (In the realm of international diplomacy, negotiators have traditionally been somewhat more attuned to thinking about how to influence multiple constituencies when forging deals—be it with the Taliban or the old Soviet Union.) There are often opportunities to change a deal’s scope and achieve better results. For example, a customer might perceive itself to be at a disadvantage in a negotiation with an important supplier because it represents only a small piece of that supplier’s overall business. A closer look, however, might reveal that it accounts for a fairly large percentage of the business at one of that supplier’s plants or in a specific geographic market for a particular unit. Though the supplier’s corporate leaders might view the customer as insignificant, the plant manager or unit head who depends on it would see it as critical. A corporation isn’t one uniform organization; it’s a federation of businesses. Most often, profits and losses are assessed not only at the enterprise level but by unit, geography, product, and plant. The authority to negotiate contracts is usually (though not always) delegated accordingly. Carefully parsing a counterpart’s constituencies is essential to understanding negotiation leverage. The supply chain team at a large hospitality and entertainment company took that lesson to heart in negotiations with major beverage suppliers. The team members recognized that bargaining with their sales counterparts over volume discounts would achieve limited value. It was only by broadening the discussion well beyond discounts and the purview of sales that they learned that other stakeholders within their suppliers had much more value to contribute. There were also opportunities to discuss promotional sponsorships at the entertainment company’s venues and events, the strong relationships the beverage suppliers had with performers who could fill those venues, marketing events that the suppliers could host at the entertainment company’s hospitality properties, and more. The vast majority of negotiators take the fundamental scope of a deal as a given. They may consider a limited set of choices—for instance, shorter- versus longer-term deals—but by and large their tactics are guided by a comparison between their BATNA and how close to some preferred outcome they think they can get. As the entertainment company’s example illustrates, however, there are often significant opportunities to change the scope of negotiations and achieve much better results. Jeff Minton Consider a health care firm that was seeking to renegotiate the terms of a major supply contract with a pharmaceutical company. The health care firm needed much more manufacturing capacity from a major plant owned and operated by the pharma company. The pharma company was loath to offer more capacity than the original contract specified, because it anticipated needing to make more of its own products at the same facility in the future. Many creative options were explored, including shared capital investments to increase the plant’s efficiency and output, altered financial terms, and the possibility of a “plant within a plant” operating model. Nonetheless, no solution appeared to meet both sides’ needs. However, when the scope of the negotiation was increased beyond altering the existing agreement, and both sides stepped back to reevaluate (and share information on) their respective global operations (including plans for building new plants) and growth objectives (and associated capital investment needs), they were able to reach an agreement. The new contract rebalanced production and supply across multiple plants and delivered substantially more value to both parties. The negotiators didn’t expand just the pie; they expanded the entire menu. Or take the financial services firm that was seeking to renew a contract with a company that owned proprietary data assets and was demanding a hefty price increase. An analysis of the annual report and earnings calls of the data company showed that it was focused on increasing revenue from other products and services—ones the financial services firm was purchasing from several other suppliers. While some of those current suppliers were highly valued partners, and it didn’t make sense to contemplate shifting business away from them, in other cases the financial firm could give the data provider an increase in business in the areas it wanted to build. The firm’s negotiating team offered to do that—but only if the provider agreed to more-reasonable terms on the data it enjoyed a de facto monopoly on. It’s worth noting how counterintuitive this approach is. When confronted with opposing parties who seem to have more leverage, the natural tendency is to look for ways to weaken that leverage—to find walkaway alternatives and issue threats. Such attempts often come up short or undermine deal success. The lesson here is to offer the other side new opportunities instead of focusing just on the needs that only it can meet for you. Think about how precedents a deal sets may create anchors in future negotiations. Sometimes the right strategy is even to reduce the scope of the deal. A classic piece of negotiation advice is to carefully evaluate (and seek to improve) your BATNA. The problem is, in most high-stakes negotiations, there’s really no viable alternative to some deal with the other party. Digging deeper into BATNA analysis is vital in such scenarios. The key is not to simply consider wholesale alternatives to any agreement with a powerful counterpart but rather to explore alternatives to some elements of what you’re seeking through that deal. Here’s how that approach worked for a medical device company that felt powerless in its negotiations with a distributor that dominated an important regional market. No other distributor had comparable coverage in the region. After considering expanding the scope of the deal, the device maker instead opted to narrow it. It identified alternative distribution channels for some of its products in some segments of the regional market. Bringing its products to market with a portfolio of smaller distributors would have been prohibitively complex and would have increased costs and reduced revenue. But once the device maker had defined a strategy to narrow the scope of the deal with the incumbent distributor, the negotiations moved to a considerably more even footing. In fact, the distributor stopped making demands and threats and became willing to engage in a collaborative process. The two sides jointly evaluated where it was especially costly for the distributor to service the device maker (business the distributor was actually happy to give up) and where it would have been most difficult for the device maker to move to alternative distributors. The narrower scope made the distributor willing to reduce some of its requirements (meant to cover the costs of distributing low-margin products in expensive-to-service segments). For the device maker, the cost of agreeing to much of what the distributor was requesting dropped significantly. All too often dealmakers conflate negotiation power with a strong BATNA and the concomitant ability to hurt the other party. Essentially, the message they send is: We don’t need a deal with you, and you need a deal with us, so we get to dictate the terms. Such a mindset leads to pressure tactics. It also makes negotiators who lack attractive walkaway alternatives conclude that they have no power, which in turn causes miscalculations and unwarranted concessions. Moreover, their sense of powerlessness can breed fear and resentment—negative emotions that hamper creative thinking about potential avenues to an optimal outcome. The solution is think beyond walkaway alternatives and consider multiple sources of not only coercive leverage but also positive leverage. By positive leverage, we mean things negotiators can uniquely offer to make the other side desire a deal rather than fear the absence of one. Many technology firms have IP teams that seek to persuade consumer electronics companies such as Apple, Sony, and LG to pay for licenses. The negotiation of IP rights in this market is dauntingly complex. Patent infringement is pervasive—though often unintentional. Legitimate efforts to collect royalties are vastly complicated by the well-known phenomenon of patent trolls. As a result, most IP licensing teams struggle to “move up in the queue” for simple consideration by underresourced in-licensing teams, who feel besieged by all the parties claiming the right to royalties—and offering little in return except an agreement not to sue. The IP licensing team at one well-known tech firm had a strong claims portfolio and compelling market data about the rights that other companies were infringing. The team tried to be creative and flexible, offering to blend payments for past infringement, ongoing royalties, and cross-licenses. However, its BATNA—filing lawsuits against infringers that ignored it—wasn’t strong, because the ability to enforce patent rights and collect damages had been hampered in recent years in many jurisdictions around the world. The firm didn’t have a particularly good track record in court, either. To various consumer electronics companies, it made sense to rebuff the team’s demands. And so they did. Thinking in binary terms is almost always counterproductive. By researching the business models and strategies of the electronics companies, the team was able to pinpoint which of its firm’s patented technologies were complementary to important initiatives at each target licensee. Working with the firm’s tech and sales departments, the team then defined value propositions showing each target licensee how it could use the firm’s IP to generate new products or revenue streams. One electronics company, for example, could leverage the tech firm’s sound and imaging IP in elder-care offerings, and another could enhance its device with the firm’s virtual reality expertise. Those opportunities made it worthwhile for the electronics companies to engage in meaningful negotiations with the team. Though this strategy required a lot of time and effort, the payoff was worth it. Most negotiators focus exclusively on maximizing the value of the deal at hand. In doing so, they often undermine the success of future negotiations—their own and those of their colleagues. A strategic approach requires considering success beyond the current deal and, in particular, how the precedents it sets will create anchors and shape dynamics in future negotiations. After all, except with pure sales and purchases of assets, most high-stakes business negotiations are repeat transactions undertaken in the context of long-term relationships. Analyzing links across multiple negotiations can unearth hidden forms of leverage. Consider the case of a global semiconductor company that felt continually squeezed by unreasonable price increases from OEM component suppliers. A major problem was that negotiations over initial licensing or codevelopment of technology for new products were conducted by one group, whereas subsequent contract negotiations (with the same suppliers, but occurring years later) were handled by another group, with relatively little coordination between the two. Meanwhile, negotiations with those suppliers and other third parties for maintenance and repair services and spare parts were handled by yet another group, and all three kinds of negotiations occurred on different timetables. One key to negotiation strategy is putting yourself in the shoes of your counterparts and truly understanding their motivations and likely actions. The best approach is to formally charter a team to analyze the negotiation from the other party’s point of view—a so-called Red Team. (During the Cold War, Red Teams played the role of the Soviet Union in war-gaming simulations.) Of course, most negotiation planning involves analyzing the goals and likely actions of the other side. In our experience, however, failures of imagination and inevitable human bias tend to limit and distort such efforts. Especially when the stakes are high and power imbalances create fear and resentment, strong emotions stunt thinking and warp rational analysis. We’ve also found that unless the Red Team includes senior or highly respected and influential members, the insights that can be drawn from war-gaming are often discounted. In some cases, simulations might be done as part of strategy development and negotiation planning. But it’s even more effective to do them throughout the negotiation process, having the Red Team revise its strategy as events unfold and using ongoing simulations to anticipate actions by the other side. By looking at these separate but related negotiations holistically, the semiconductor company was able to alter the power dynamics. Teams negotiating supply agreements acknowledged that they had little choice but to accept an incumbent supplier’s pricing and terms but were able to point to upcoming product introductions and warn that unreasonable positions held now would most likely exclude suppliers from being considered for next-generation products—and all associated downstream revenue. They also shared data about maintenance and repair revenue streams and their growing ability to redirect such business to partners who demonstrated reasonableness and good faith. Threats and promises about future business had been made in the past by the company’s negotiators, but they weren’t specific and lacked credibility. Now the benefits of increased cooperation and the potential loss of opportunities were tangible to suppliers—and hence persuasive. Many people seek to speed up or slow down negotiations to put pressure on the other side and extract concessions. But pressure tactics often backfire. Careful consideration of how the other side is likely to respond should guide when to accelerate, slow down, or pause a negotiation. Several years ago a small technology company was in negotiations to renew a critical deal with an internet behemoth. The small company depended a lot on the revenue the deal produced, and the thought of going without it for even a short time was frightening. Seeking to pressure the small firm, the behemoth showed little urgency to complete the deal and signaled that it wasn’t sure the contract was worth renewing. That turned out to be a major miscalculation. Recognizing that it could do little to get the other side to go faster, the small company’s negotiation team decided to make use of the time to build support within the firm’s ecosystem of customers and business partners for the possibility of partnering with one of the behemoth’s giant competitors instead. That time was well spent. As such an alternative went from unimaginable to conceivable to plausible, the smaller firm’s leverage grew. In the end the contract with the behemoth was renewed for a nine-figure value that represented a nearly five-fold increase over the expiring deal. While the passage of time did make the small firm nervous about its dwindling cash reserves, it also gave it the opportunity to substantially alter the landscape in which the negotiation took place. Choreographing the sequence in which you address issues or engage different players is also important. Resolving some issues may reset the stakes or reframe the remainder of the negotiation. A good example of strategically rethinking sequence in a negotiation comes from the oil and gas industry. As part of a joint venture deal with a national oil company, one large multinational had agreed that if a particular competitor wanted to add itself to the deal later, it could do so by paying its share of the capital plus interest for the time it hadn’t participated. A few years later that second multinational indeed triggered its option and sought to open negotiations on the rate of interest. Instead of discussing how many points above or below LIBOR would be appropriate, the multinational decided to go back to the oil company and negotiate what further terms should apply to the revised deal. The multinational proposed the principle that a later entrant shouldn’t earn a higher rate of return than the original partners, who had taken a greater risk before the project had proved its value. The oil company readily agreed. With that matter settled, the multinational turned to the new partner-to-be and demonstrated, using the recently audited books for the joint venture, that the interest owed by an incoming partner would have to be 60% a year, not anything like LIBOR. After some initial shock, the incoming partner agreed. Five questions can help negotiators strategically manage timing and sequencing: When approaching a high-stakes deal with a powerful counterpart, many negotiators debate whether to start by issuing their own proposal or by asking the other side to do so. They also often wonder whether they should pro​ject strength by asking for aggressive terms in their first offer or counteroffer, or signal a desire for a win-win outcome through more-balanced and reasonable terms. But such binary thinking blinds us to the many ways we might shape the negotiation process to reduce risk and increase the likelihood of a great outcome. Let’s look at a global health care company that depended on a single supplier to make one of its biggest revenue-generating products. The supplier held numerous patents essential to the manufacturing process, so switching to a different one would have taken years and major investments in redesign. But for many years the supplier had been unwilling to collaborate on improving quality and manufacturing efficiency. As the contract with it neared expiration, the health care company pondered how to open the negotiation for a renewal. Should it demand big price reductions and other improvements? Or should it begin with more-reasonable terms and hope that the supplier responded in kind? After much debate about the trade-offs, the health care company developed a third approach. Rather than beginning by sending an initial term sheet, it invited the supplier to a prenegotiation summit—a joint discussion of what had worked well, and what hadn’t, for each side under the prior contract and of how the market and each side’s business objectives had changed. This was deemed a low-risk move. The supplier might well decline the offer, but so what? The health care company’s negotiation team would then simply revert to sending an opening term sheet. To the surprise of some on the team, the supplier accepted the invitation. During the summit the health care company’s team shared an analysis of the economics and evolving market position of the company’s product. It showed that unless the product’s price fell significantly, new competitive offerings would take substantial market share away from it. That would reduce not only the health care company’s revenue but also the supplier’s. The analysis triggered an animated discussion focused not on bargaining but on joint problem-solving. That in turn led to thinking about how to creatively restructure the way the companies worked together and to a set of principles for negotiating commercial terms in the new contract, including a framework for sharing risks and rewards. The ultimate deal saved the manufacturer tens of millions of dollars but was viewed by the supplier as more favorable than the earlier contract. Both sides agreed that a traditional “offer-counteroffer” negotiation process would at best have yielded a significantly less valuable deal for both—and could easily have resulted in no deal at all.  High-stakes negotiations tend to produce a lot of anxiety. This leads dealmakers to focus on (perceived) threats rather than identify all possible forms of leverage and think expansively about options. When that happens, negotiators are more likely to make poor tactical choices, either giving in to pressure from the other side or inadvertently causing their own worst fears to come to pass. A strategic negotiation approach involves more than choosing a cooperative or competitive posture, and thinking in such binary terms is almost always counterproductive. Assessing connections between one negotiation and others with the same party over time (and even with other parties), taking a hard look at whether they’re negotiating about the right things, and focusing on when and how to most effectively engage with the other side will unlock far more value for dealmakers.

Most of these efforts to transform will fail. And, in most cases, they miss the mark not because the new strategy is flawed, but because the organization can’t carry it out. To survive this pandemic, leaders must confront the reality of their competitive environment and the hidden barriers that make their organization ineffective. If your strategy is failing and you don’t know why, look for these hidden barriers in your organization: unclear values, ineffective senior team, ineffective leadership style, poor coordination, inadequate leadership development, and inadequate vertical communication. Nearly every organization is grappling with huge strategic challenges, often with a need to reimagine its very purpose, identity, strategy, business model, and structure. Most of these efforts to transform will fail. And, in most cases, they will miss the mark not because the new strategy is flawed, but because the organization can’t carry it out. The Covid-19 pandemic undoubtedly presents the biggest challenge institutions of all types have faced in over a century. Leaders will have to reimagine their strategy and values in the context of the “new normal” we are entering, requiring organizations to fundamentally transform their systems of organizing, managing, and leading to enable effective execution of the new direction — and do it quickly. In this crisis speed is essential. My experience in working and studying corporate transformations points to the six common interrelated reasons for failures — I call these hidden barriers. Leaders often don’t know — and sometimes do not want to know — about hidden barriers that stand in the way of their institution’s transformation. People do not speak up about these barriers, fearing career derailment and even firing (think Boeing, Wells Fargo, Volkswagen, and many others). That in turn makes it impossible for senior teams to learn about barriers and change them. To survive this pandemic, leaders must confront the reality of their competitive environment and the hidden barriers that make their organization ineffective. Let’s look at the six barriers: Often, the underlying problem is not this or that strategy, but rather the process by which the strategy was formed — or the lack of any such process. In these cases, strategy is often developed by the leader along with the chief strategy or marketing executive and only then communicated to the rest of the senior team for discussion. If the whole team is not involved clarity and commitment are not possible. Your organization is suffering from this barrier if you notice any of these signs: Top-team ineffectiveness was reported by lower levels in almost all the organizations we studied. Most of the time, this ineffectiveness comes from the top team not speaking with a common voice about strategy and value. The organization-wide consequences of this were low trust, low commitment to strategic decisions, and different and sometimes conflicting understandings of what the strategy even was. In all these cases, the leaders and their senior teams had not solved the fundamental problem of getting everyone on the senior team in the room to talk about the right things in the right way — honestly and constructively. Your organization is suffering from this barrier if you notice any of these signs among the senior team: When it comes to individual leadership, there are two ineffective styles: a top-down approach that does not involve team members sufficiently and a laissez-faire, nonconfrontational style. We’ve found you can attribute either style to the leader’s personal aversion to conflict or to the lack of a clearly defined process for opening a constructive debate and carrying it through to a decision (in other words, a decision-making process). As a result, the leader doesn’t learn about what members of the senior team or lower levels really think about what’s not working and why. Your organization is suffering from this barrier if you notice any of these signs: Coordination across silos — functions and business units or geographic regions at the corporate level critical to effective execution of strategy  — is always a challenge. Ineffective senior teams whose members defend their fiefdoms are unable to agree on how to reorganize and reshape the culture to overcome naturally occurring obstacles to coordination and collaboration. If there’s friction, then the cross-boundary team structure for integrating value-creating activities either does not exist or is flawed and the lack of honest, collective, and public conversation prevents the organization from recognizing and correcting those flaws. Your organization is suffering from this barrier if you notice any of these signs: Research has shown that leaders usually develop not through training, but by carrying out challenging new assignments. This requires managers to sacrifice for the larger good by giving up their high potential leaders to other parts of the organization for their development. When this doesn’t occur naturally and regularly it is tied to three hidden barriers already discussed: An ineffective senior team (#2) in a siloed organization with “fiefdoms” (#4) that does not have the perspective or capability to define collaborative organizational values and behaviors it expects of leaders (#1), nor to design a talent-management system that enables the cross-boundary developmental assignments required to develop general management ability. Your organization is suffering from this barrier if you notice any of these signs: Inadequate honest vertical communication is like a bad game of Telephone. The necessary information about an organization’s strategic direction and values does not circulate from the senior team to the lower levels and the necessary information about the barriers to that direction and those values is not recirculated from the lower levels to the senior team. Rather than productive conversation, there is increased confusion. Your organization is suffering from this barrier if you notice any of these signs: The inability to confront the first five hidden barriers, and to foster an honest conversation about them between the top team and lower levels, makes it impossible to transform the hidden barriers into the strengths your organization needs to survive the Covid-19 crisis. Start with an assessment. If you recognized your organization in each or most of the six hidden barriers described above, your organization is probably having a hard time transforming itself in some important way. If most of the items in any given hidden barrier category are true, that particular barrier is playing a strong role in undermining the effectiveness and agility of your organization.

"129",129,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/growth-after-trauma","strategy.txt","“At some point we will be able to reflect on the long-term consequences of this terrible time,” the author writes. “Almost certainly [they] will include some good along with the bad.” Negative experiences can bring a recognition of personal strength, the exploration of new possibilities, improved relationships with others, a greater appreciation for life, and spiritual growth. Post-traumatic growth often happens naturally, Tedeschi says, but it can be facilitated in five ways: through education (rethinking ourselves, our world, and our future), emotional regulation (managing our negative emotions and reflecting on successes and possibilities), disclosure (articulating what is happening and its effects), narrative development (shaping the story of a trauma and deriving hope from famous stories of crucible leadership), and service (finding work that benefits others). What good can come of this? In times of stress, crisis, or trauma, people often ask that question. This year we’ve been hit by a pandemic that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, unprecedented unemployment, and a global economic downturn. In the face of such a tragedy—personal and collective—it might appear that the answer is “Nothing.”   However, at some point we will be able to reflect on the long-term consequences of this terrible time and what it has wrought for each of us as individuals and for our organizations, communities, and nations. Almost certainly those outcomes will include some good along with the bad. Over the past 25 years psychologists like me have been studying this phenomenon. We refer to it as posttraumatic growth. We’ve learned that negative experiences can spur positive change, including a recognition of personal strength, the exploration of new possibilities, improved relationships, a greater appreciation for life, and spiritual growth. We see this in people who have endured war, natural disasters, bereavement, job loss and economic stress, serious illnesses and injuries. So despite the misery resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, many of us can expect to develop in beneficial ways in its aftermath. And leaders can help others to do so. Although posttraumatic growth often happens naturally, without psychotherapy or other formal intervention, it can be facilitated in five ways: through education, emotional regulation, disclosure, narrative development, and service. As a researcher and a practicing psychotherapist, I (and my colleagues) have helped hundreds of people emerge stronger from suffering in these ways. You can emerge stronger yourself. And you can serve as what we call an expert companion for others, encouraging introspection and curiosity, actively listening, and offering compassionate feedback. Here are the five ways in more detail: To move through trauma to growth, one must first get educated about what the former is: a disruption of core belief systems. For example, before the pandemic, many of us thought we were safe from the types of diseases that endangered people in the past; that bad things happened in other parts of the world but not ours; and that our social and economic systems were resilient enough to weather all storms. None of that was true. So now we need to figure out what to believe instead. When our assumptions are challenged, it is confusing and frightening and tends to produce anxious, repetitive thinking: Why did this happen? Who’s in control? What should I do now? We are forced to rethink who we are, what kind of people surround us, what world we live in, and what future we will have. It can be extremely painful. But as research shows, it can also usher in change that will be of value. We must begin by learning and understanding that truth. I once counseled a woman who, in her thirties, was disabled by a stroke and initially struggled to cope. But she soon understood that her changed circumstances would require her to reevaluate her identity: “Now I have to figure out what is next in this life I never thought I would be living. Part of me doesn’t want to think I have to do this, but I know I do.” That was the first step in her becoming a person with more compassion for herself who could accept limitations without being limited by them. As we move through the current health and economic crisis, consider how you can reinforce—to yourself and others—the recognition that it may have a positive as well as a negative impact. Remember that you and others in your team and organization can reimagine how you operate and innovate in new circumstances. That may already be evident in the emergency measures taken to keep things going. For example, I know an IT employee of a food service company that laid off most of its workers earlier this year. As one of the few to remain, she was forced to work in functions and areas she’d never touched before, which was a struggle. But she soon realized that unencumbered by the usual bureaucracy and turf battles, she could ferret out inefficiencies and find ways to improve on old procedures. To do any learning, one must be in the right frame of mind. That starts with managing negative emotions such as anxiety, guilt, and anger, which can be done by shifting the kind of thinking that leads to those feelings. Instead of focusing on losses, failures, uncertainties, and worst-case scenarios, try to recall successes, consider best-case possibilities, reflect on your own or your organization’s resources and preparation, and think reasonably about what you—personally and as a group—can do. For the founder of one dining chain, emotional regulation was crucial after his board ousted him from the CEO role. As he wrote in HBR (“Crucible: Losing the Top Job—and Winning It Back,” October 2010), the news came as a complete shock, and he was furious at first. But when his father, also an investor, told him to “get [his] head around being supportive,” he did. Instead of focusing on his anger and the feeling that he’d been betrayed, he started thinking about how he could stay calm and professional and help the business going forward. He eventually returned to lead the company. You can regulate emotions directly by observing them as they are experienced. Physical exercise and meditative practices such as breathing also help. Employ these techniques yourself and share them to help others. Acknowledge that circumstances continue to be both challenging and frightening; then demonstrate poise under that pressure. And encourage more-frequent communication so that people feel less isolated and see their collective emotional strength more clearly. This is the part of the process in which you talk about what has happened and is happening: its effects—both small and broad, short- and long-term, personal and professional, individual and organizational—and what you are struggling with in its wake. Articulating these things helps us to make sense of the trauma and turn debilitating thoughts into more-productive reflections. If you’re helping someone talk about what it’s been like to experience this crisis, asking a lot of questions can seem like an intrusive interrogation spurred by curiosity rather than concern. It’s best to focus on how the impact feels and which of your counterpart’s concerns are most important. Negative experiences can spur a greater appreciation for life. A case study comes from a former client. A talented developer getting established in a new company, he created a program that had great promise. But then his bosses hired someone from the outside to run it, asking my client to report to him. Led by this manager, the program underperformed, and the developer was being blamed, damaging his reputation and career prospects. Finally he went to HR. “I wasn’t sure if this was the right move,” he told me, “but I needed to get some advice.” Talking to the HR representative was cathartic, and he ended up telling her more than he’d planned to, because she asked questions such as “What did it feel like to have this project taken from you and essentially messed up?” She then worked to help him recover from that big professional setback. It is important for you as a colleague and a leader to understand the varying impacts the pandemic and the ensuing market volatility, layoffs, and recession have had and continue to have on the lives of those around you. Start by speaking openly about your own struggles and how you are managing the uncertainty. You can then invite others to tell their stories, and listen attentively as they locate their difficulties and come to terms with how their challenges and losses compare with those of others. The next step is to produce an authentic narrative about the trauma and our lives afterward so that we can accept the chapters already written and imagine crafting the next ones in a meaningful way. Your story—and the stories of people you’re helping—can and should be about a traumatic past that leads to a better future.  Consider a nonprofit executive who had been fired from two previous positions over sexual harassment allegations. One night, as he and his wife were driving on the interstate, they were involved in a horrific crash, plowing into a stopped vehicle that didn’t have its lights on. His wife’s injuries were minor, but he was left comatose for a month and needed a year of rehabilitation to walk and talk again. His new narrative went something like this: “Many would think it was this accident that put my life in jeopardy. But I was already in great danger. I was causing pain to others, ruining my career, and heading for a life without my wife or children. The accident forced me to stop, created time for reflection, and showed me what love really is.” When you’re ready, start to shape the narrative of this year’s trauma for yourself and your organization. How has it caused you to recalibrate your priorities? What new paths or opportunities have emerged from it? Look to famous stories of crucible leadership involving people such as Oprah Winfrey and Nelson Mandela, and companies such as Chrysler and Johnson & Johnson, that have emerged from crisis stronger. They are examples of posttraumatic growth. Study and derive hope from them and remind those connected to you to do the same. People do better in the aftermath of trauma if they find work that benefits others—helping people close to them or their broader community or victims of events similar to the ones they have endured. Two mothers I know who’d each lost a child started a nonprofit to help bereaved families connect with others who understood their grief. Forty years later the organization thrives under the leadership of people who have faced similar losses and want to share the strength they’ve gained. Another great example of service comes from Ken Falke, who was a bomb-disposal specialist in the U.S. Navy for more than 20 years. Having seen the wounds of war firsthand, he wanted to help others recover. He and his wife, Julia, began by visiting hospitalized combat veterans, but they felt that wasn’t enough. So they founded the organization where I now work: the Boulder Crest Institute, which has based its Retreat for Military and Veteran Wellness programs on the posttraumatic growth model. Of course, you don’t need to start a nonprofit or a foundation to be of service. Focusing on how you can help provide relief during the continuing crisis—whether by sewing masks or producing content, stocking shelves or retraining teammates, supporting small businesses or agreeing to a temporary pay cut—can lead to growth. So can simply expressing gratitude and showing compassion and empathy to others. How you and your group turn to service will determine whether you see the pandemic and its fallout as an unmitigated tragedy or as an opportunity to find new and better ways to live and operate. Maybe you can see how to ensure that similar emergencies are handled better in the future. Perhaps you can help those most seriously affected. Look for personal and shared missions that energize you and help you find meaning. Hopefully, through this process, you and your teammates or organization will experience growth in one or more of these areas: People are often surprised by how well they have handled trauma. They are left better equipped to tackle future challenges. That can apply to teams and organizations, too. Groups often come through such trials with a clearer picture of their collective knowledge, skills, resilience, and growth potential. Take, for example, a restaurant owner who opened up his new place this past January. By March social distancing policies meant that his entire plan needed reconfiguring. He thought about laying off his staff, waiting for the pandemic to pass, and starting over. But he surprised himself by instead recommitting to the venture and engaging all his employees—from the kitchen and wait staff to his business team—to see if together they could find a way to proceed. When new realities prevent the resumption of old habits, roles, and strategies, we must adapt and innovate. Leaders must have the courage and enthusiasm to test these new paths and show their people that change is to be embraced rather than feared. The restaurant owner encouraged his group to invent a business that would draw on the resources they had—both personal and material—and allow the enterprise to survive. They began taking inventory of one another’s skills and experiences and rose to the challenge of redesigning their work. These are often born of the need to give and receive support through trying times. Trauma can help forge new relationships and make people more grateful for the ones they already have. Coming through a crisis together is a bonding experience. This happened quickly with the restaurant employees. They began to fully appreciate the value that each one of them brought to the table. People who had hardly known one another three months earlier became closer and began functioning as a tight and flexible team. When confronted with fear and loss, we often become better at noticing what we still have but may have previously overlooked. Leaders can model this by acknowledging that fundamental things about living and working are to be valued. We have a great team. Our customers appreciate the work we do. We’ve kept the business alive for the benefit of all who still work in it. Our organization strives toward a higher purpose. Even something as mundane as remarking that your morning coffee tastes good counts. Trauma can make people more grateful for the relationships they already have. Aware that most others in their industry were losing jobs, everyone at the restaurant agreed to stay on for less pay so that no one would be let go. All felt grateful to still be employed, no matter what role they might play in the revamped business. None seemed to consider any job beneath them. They appreciated having an opportunity to keep doing something worthwhile. This comes from reflection on the “big questions” that are often ignored in the routine of daily life. The challenges to core beliefs that we encounter in trauma often force people to become amateur theologians or philosophers to design a life worth continuing to live. Organizations, too, can be confronted with existential questions: Are we conducting our business ethically? Do we practice the principles we preach? Should we be doing something else with our valuable time and resources? What is our contribution to the betterment of society? What is the primary motive for our ongoing existence? It takes courage and foresight for leaders to open up such issues to scrutiny. The restaurant team decided that the business should be a hybrid: part grocery store, part food prep and takeout or delivery service, and part warehouse and distribution point for donations to the local food pantry. The owner and employees wanted to serve the community and knew they would build goodwill as a by-product. They were positioning themselves for short-term survival and long-term success. Any person, team, or organization can do the same. If you’re thinking this is all too optimistic or naive, you may still be too close to the tragedy of this pandemic. That may also be true of others around you. So be patient as you work through and facilitate the process of posttraumatic growth. Those of us practicing in this field know that timing is crucial. Growth can’t be forced, and it can’t be rushed. However, when you and others are ready, it is worth the effort. Let’s make sure that we derive something positive from this time of struggle. The possibilities for personal and collective growth should not be squandered. Richard G. Tedeschi is a professor of psychology emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte; the distinguished chair of the Boulder Crest Institute; and a coauthor of Posttraumatic Growth (2018)."

As new regulations are set to go into force in the United States, the stakes for getting this pivot right are higher than ever before. The Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating digital transformations, and companies should consider implementing these four privacy-focused measures: 1) Check how your vendors and partners use customer data, 2) Perform impact assessments to monitor risk, 3) Strive for clarity in your privacy policy, and 4) Designate a data protection officer. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. For companies everywhere, Covid-19 has expedited digital transformation at almost unimaginable speed. In an effort to survive and get back to business safely, companies have rapidly adopted services such as contactless payment, click-and-collect applications, and enhanced customer relationship management. These transitions are vital for business to continue, but each also introduces new risks. For every business that shifts operations online, there are potential privacy pitfalls that will prove very damaging if mismanaged, and as new regulations are set to go into force in the United States, the stakes for getting this pivot right are higher than ever before. Across industries, teams with expertise in real-world spaces are rushing into digital ones where they’re novices and pumping huge amounts of user data into new systems. In the restaurant industry, establishments are scrambling to build new online ordering and delivery infrastructure or to partner with companies who already offer those services. In higher education, institutions faced with missing out on a year’s tuition fees are rapidly migrating their entire curriculum online, and rushing to digitize everything from online teaching to student health records. In the live events space, production veterans are being asked to migrate their well-established processes online and into new cloud technologies. In each case, these changes carry the risk that reams of personal data will be mismanaged and vulnerable to exposure. This situation raises two major challenges for many businesses: First, they need to make quick decisions on procuring new technology: building online storefronts, implementing communications platforms that process customers’ personal data, and more. Second, they lack experience with data processing infrastructure, or even technology in general. That adds up to teams making quick decisions on the use of technology systems they don’t know much about. There might be an understandable temptation to treat privacy concerns as a secondary issue — one that can be addressed after the immediate crisis — but that would be a mistake, and one which would place companies at elevated risk of monetary fines, class-action lawsuits, and PR headaches. There’s been growing regulatory pressure on both sides of the Atlantic. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which was implemented in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States, which becomes enforceable by law on July 1 (impacting any company with a presence in California and over $25 million in annual revenue), contain stringent protocols for the management of user data, and both threaten steep fines for businesses that get data wrong. Particularly in the United States, there’s little reason to think that regulators will meaningfully relax standards because of the pandemic. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has been unambiguous in his intent to press forward on implementing CCPA, stating: “We’re committed to enforcing the law starting July 1. We encourage businesses to be particularly mindful of data security in this time of emergency.” The good news is that managing privacy concerns doesn’t have to be yet another daunting task on top of the already Herculean feat of moving large parts of your business online. There are a number of simple, meaningful steps you can take to minimize the risk of a privacy breach. To make your rapid digital transformation as safe as reasonably possible in the coming months, consider implementing these privacy-focused measures. Each can be done independently, but if your business can tick all four of these boxes, you’ll greatly mitigate privacy risk: Businesses may be tempted to rush into contracts with third-party vendors who promise “plug-and-play” solutions to a number of digital transformation challenges. And while companies may be aware that they must review any Data Processing Agreements (DPA) during procurement, there is a tendency to underestimate the consequences of skipping this step. Under CCPA and GDPR, a business can be held financially liable for failure to perform due diligence on third parties that process customer data — in fact, this was the scenario that led to Marriott Hotel Group being fined $123 million by ICO in 2019. Your key focus when reviewing vendor DPAs should be ensuring they’re privacy compliant and that their data policies align with your business’s stated data policies — otherwise a business runs the risk of violating their own privacy policy. Additionally, check the language about subcontractors in any vendor DPA. There should be assurance that vendors won’t subcontract to another processor unless explicitly instructed by your business to do so. This ensures your business is legally protected if a vendor unilaterally offloads data duties to a non-compliant third party. Impact assessments for data processing are required in many cases by GDPR, but not required by the CCPA. However in times of frenetic change, implementing basic risk assessments for data activities — however tedious — forces businesses to think critically before making a potentially damaging decision on issues like data storage, subcontracting, and more. Furthermore, in the event of being charged with a privacy violation, a paper trail demonstrating proactive steps to mitigate risk reads favorably to regulators. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office provides a free data protection impact assessment template that will set your business on the right track to accurately assessing privacy risk, whether you’re based there or not. As key stakeholders reevaluate privacy policies ahead of CCPA enforcement, consider how the document reads. Your goal is to make this policy accessible to all of your customers — not just those fluent in legalese. You might think you’re covering yourself by including phrases wide open to interpretation to prepare for any future regulatory requirement, but your priority should be to help your increasingly privacy-savvy customers understand your policy and trust your company. Slack’s privacy policy shows that thoroughness doesn’t have to come at the expense of clarity for readers. No matter a business’s size, centralizing responsibility for data decisions is preferable to diffusing responsibility across multiple departments. That is truer than ever during times of rapid change. DPOs serve as a focal point for privacy concerns within an organization and a vital liaison to regulatory bodies while the character of privacy law enforcement remains ambiguous. Even if the person lacks privacy experience, empowering a single set of eyes to focus on privacy is a quick, cost-conscious way to de-risk. As stated at the outset, managing rapid digital transformation well can require taking risky action. But in the current climate, depending on regulatory largesse is an unnecessary risk for businesses when they can take simple, process-driven steps to shore up privacy. Data privacy implementation exhibits many features of the economist’s “time inconsistency” dilemma – it’s too soon to do it until it’s too late. And as we’ve seen in the last few weeks, “too late” can mean a serious stumble at a critical business juncture.

"131",131,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/a-new-prescription-for-power","strategy.txt","Leaders often view power as a purely personal quality, derived from their formal roles and titles, accreditations, skills, and experience; from the information they control and the reputation they’ve built; and from their charisma, resilience, and energy. But as most discover, effectively wielding power is rarely straightforward. Simply exercising control over others—the traditional concept of power—is often not the best strategy; it may not even be an option. Indeed, the most potent uses of power often involve no direct influence tactics at all. The authors have developed an approach to power that goes beyond exerting control and mobilizes others’ energy and commitment. It focuses on three core dimensions: Situational power rests on the ability to align objectives, the environment, and bases of power. Relational power is about connections and coalitions: They can be a major source of support, advice, information, and resources—but if neglected or ignored, they can loom as potential points of resistance. Dynamic power involves continually adapting influence strategies to changes in organizational and social systems. The degree to which leaders draw on all three dimensions of power determines how effectively they get things done. Simply exercising control over others—the traditional concept of power—is often not the best strategy. When the path ahead or the very need for change is in dispute, when looking to seize an opportunity rather than put out a fire, when working across silos where claims to authority may be ambiguous, leaders should take a different approach. A new model of power focuses on its three core dimensions: situational, relational, and dynamic. The degree to which leaders draw on all three determines how effectively they get things done. Tara, the chief strategy officer of a  software firm, was the newest member of the C-suite. Except for the CEO, the other officers had joined the executive team from the technology side in the course of acquisitions. Tara, the only MBA, had come from the business side and been recommended by the board. She was excited about her mandate: to drive a coherent strategy across the firm’s fragmented divisions.   Several months in, however, Tara had accomplished little. She’d been blocked by her fellow officers at every turn. In frustration, she asked her supporters on the board to back her up with the CEO. She was stunned when they not only declined but said they might have erred in recommending her for the position. What had gone wrong? As most leaders discover sooner or later, effectively wielding power is rarely straightforward. Simply exercising control over others—the traditional concept of power—is often not the best strategy; it may not even be an option. When the path ahead or the very need for change is in dispute, when looking to seize an opportunity rather than put out a fire, when working across silos where claims to authority may be ambiguous and contested, leaders should take a different approach. The most potent uses of power often involve no direct influence tactics at all. On the basis of decades of research and consulting with executives and managers, we have developed an approach to power that goes beyond exerting control and mobilizes others’ energy and commitment. Our model of power focuses on its three core dimensions: situational, relational, and dynamic. The degree to which you draw on all three will determine how effectively you get things done. Leaders often view power as a purely personal quality, derived from their formal roles and titles, accreditations, skills, and experience; from the information they control and the reputation they’ve built; and from their charisma, resilience, and energy. But power also arises from and depends on situational factors such as your objectives, the environment, and bases of power. Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeffer has observed that one of the primary ways leaders limit their own power is by failing to search for and cultivate sources of influence beyond formal authority and personal charisma. We suggest several steps to help you identify and deploy situational sources of power. Begin by considering the nature of your goal. For example, are you advancing structural change or refining an existing process? Are you managing a crisis or championing a new initiative? Then think about how you might engage others’ energy and commitment to achieve that goal. Ask yourself not just why the goal is important to you but also why it might be important to your colleagues, your company, and society. By drilling down into these questions, you can capture the emotions needed to win the hearts and minds of others while accumulating resilience and energy for the work ahead. Power is often most potent when it mobilizes passion—your own and others’—and when personal objectives and the demands of the situation align. Consider Chief, the private network for connecting and supporting executive women. At critical junctures in their careers, founders Carolyn Childers and Lindsay Kaplan had each wished for advice from other female executives only to realize that like many women, they lacked the deep networks men had built. Inspired by the YPO model, which connects young business leaders around the world, they saw an opportunity to link women executives. Leaving high-profile roles at other companies, they called on funders and power brokers inside and outside their personal networks to help realize their vision. Chief’s first “clubhouse” opened its doors in New York in 2019. It was soon fully subscribed, with members paying hefty fees to belong and committing themselves to growing the organization. In pursuing their personal and professional goals, Childers and Kaplan tapped into a need and desire for community among female leaders and crafted an offering that resonated deeply with them. Most people believe in a just world—one in which credit and rewards accrue in accordance with performance. But that conviction can become an obstacle to the effective development and use of power. In fact, MIT professor Emilio Castilla’s research on the so-called meritocracy paradox finds that bias is higher in contexts that focus exclusively on who is most deserving. Situational power, then, starts with the recognition that working harder and smarter often fails to achieve the “earned” outcome. To get results, leaders should instead work with trusted colleagues and stakeholders to assess the lay of the land and identify blind spots. How does your goal fit within the existing landscape? Why hasn’t the problem you’re addressing already been remedied, or the innovation you’re promoting been realized? What obstacles stand in your way? Steven, a rising executive at a century-old insurance company, saw an opportunity to apply a user-centered design approach to drive strategic innovation, but he lacked the status to advance such a major initiative himself. Despite his best efforts, he was unable to get his colleagues on board. As he thought about why he was deadlocked, he realized that they saw design thinking as a fad and didn’t want to commit employees or other resources to it. Yet as he considered the “why” behind his proposal, he recognized that a user-centered approach not only reflected his values but also resonated with the firm’s origin story and mission: taking care of customers in times of need. He realized that reframing his proposal as an articulation of the organization’s core values would yield power he could leverage, especially with his skeptical colleagues. Acting on that insight, he successfully pushed his initiative through. In a study of successful corporate leaders and entrepreneurs, one of us (Kathleen) and colleagues looked at ways in which formal positions and status markers helped leaders advance their goals. One executive described her motivation for going to business school at age 40 this way: “To get in the room with the guys, you need to be able to talk their language and…have the credibility of knowing that you went to one of the best schools and did very well.” Titles and credentials can secure a place at the table—but they are not always sufficient for the effective exercise of power. Another executive in Kathleen’s study was a banker we’ll call Meghan, who, having led several successful IPOs, was hired for a corporate leadership role at a big-box retailer. “The board wanted someone with my skill set, but many in the company reacted violently, like ‘We don’t know you, and we don’t know why you’re here,’” she told us. “I had to work really, really hard to gain authority.” To her surprise, her new colleagues didn’t seem to care about her IPO credentials. “It wasn’t about the deal anymore. I had to put on an apron and work in the store. To gain authority, I had to learn the business from the ground up.” When considering a new position, leaders should think not only about what titles and resources the job confers but also about whether the culture is one in which they can thrive. One newly minted MBA turned down an offer that would have required rotations in multiple cities, choosing instead a small, growing firm based in her hometown, where she understood the values needed for success. That intuitive understanding, she felt, would allow her to cultivate a stronger base of power than would the constant adaptation associated with moving from one unfamiliar city to another. “It was a company with a lot of integrity, and it was headquartered in the city my spouse and I were from,” she recalled. “All the stars were aligned.” Your job title and personal charisma will take you only so far. Your power strategy should be informed by your objectives, the environment, and bases of power. Ask yourself: Beyond your personal attributes and the situational factors in your organization, your power is also enabled and constrained by your interactions with others. The relationships and coalitions you forge can be a major source of support, advice, information, and resources; those you overlook or ignore can loom as potential points of resistance. The COO of an international manufacturing firm we worked with builds and leverages relationships with plant leaders with an unusual frequency and intensity. “The division heads and sales leaders have my cell phone number, and I have theirs. I can call them anytime,” she told us. “They tell me things I need to know, and I tell them things they need to know—things that will help them or are hot buttons for them.” And she is keenly aware of the value of nurturing relationships over time. “I’m working on a project that requires a change in manufacturing and distribution,” she said. “The marketing element of the initiative is huge. Because I worked closely with the marketing team five years ago, anytime I call them, their response is, ‘Yeah, we can do that.’” To cultivate and exercise relational power, take the following steps. Consider who could help you advance your ideas and then map the array of allies, resisters, and others who might affect your efforts. This will help you understand people’s positions and priorities, actual and possible points of resistance, and potential blocking and supporting coalitions. Then ask yourself, What sources of influence can I deploy to engage others? How will I be able to tell whether those efforts are enough? Another executive in Kathleen’s study recounted a time when, as a newly promoted manager, she was working on a potentially transformative idea. The local vice president expressed interest in the idea but felt it would be impossible to forge a partnership with a key outside company. Undeterred, the manager focused on expanding her knowledge of that firm. “I never stopped talking to people,” she recalled. “Before hanging up, I would say, ‘Can you give me the name of someone else to talk to?’ I learned everything I could about the company—where its business was, where it was trying to make inroads, what its needs were.” Within a few months this relationship building yielded a connection to the company’s founder, who agreed to give the idea a trial. It proved so successful that the manager ended up leaving the company to found her own firm, built around the new partnership. Tara, the CSO who was struggling to implement a unified strategy in her software firm, is another case in point. Assessing her company’s relational landscape, she recognized that shared values were established in the divisions and then traveled to the center, not the reverse. As she was considering how to get her plans on track, a divisional general manager left the firm. Seeing the potential benefits to working side by side with other GMs, Tara asked to lead the division during the search for a permanent head while retaining her role as chief strategy officer. This brought her into the fold in a way she could never have achieved solely as CSO, and she gained the other GMs’ buy-in on a strategy that was ultimately backed by her peers in the C-suite. A pediatrician at a large New England hospital learned the value of this approach. “Usually I would develop what I thought was a good idea and then worry about getting others to adopt it,” she says. “But nothing would happen: People resisted, either openly or passively. Finally, I began to take time up front—engaging in empathic inquiry and inviting others to co-create a solution with me—and the results have been incredible. By the time we pitched to secure resources for a radically new process for onboarding doctors and nurses, I already had the buy-in of the other key doctors and the heads of nursing. The hospital couldn’t say no.” One of us (Elizabeth) has found in her work with executives and entrepreneurs that this pitfall—putting ideas first and people second—is common. By taking the opposite tack, leaders may discover that they no longer have to rely solely on personal influence tactics. When assessing their power, Pfeffer says, leaders need to map their dependencies. Who relies on you? On whom do you rely? Who controls the resources in your firm, and why? Your position in the flow of resources may be as important as your formal title; you can accrue power by controlling and creating resources that others need. The fewer substitutes for the resources you command, the more power you have. But there will inevitably be times when you are more dependent on others than they are on you. The goal then is to find ways to create value for them and thus increase their reliance on you. Pat Fili-Krushel, who started as a secretary at ABC Sports and rose to become president of the network, realized at the start that her initial role could limit her unless she developed sponsors who recognized what she brought to the organization. In each new position she found ways to help her bosses succeed. “I was a learning machine,” she says. “Each boss knew I would always get him the information and results he needed.” Fili-Krushel’s bosses quickly came to rely on her, and in return they recommended her for successively bigger roles. As the sociologist Ron Burt has noted, relational power often comes from brokering connections among others—which may require some finesse. While leaders can often extract information and value by keeping people strategically isolated, that approach may undermine trust and commitment. Instead, as Elizabeth discovered in a multiyear ethnography of leaders in the global music industry, a strategic understanding of when and how to bring people together is also needed to develop and implement good ideas. Jesse, a highly successful Nashville producer, carefully choreographs how he brings together various parties—artists, studio musicians, label personnel, and others—at the outset of a project. He makes a point of publicly praising specific people’s expertise and highlighting what each member contributes to the team; this has real implications for the ultimate performance, he finds. Later in the process, strategic separation might be in order. A producer named Sarah uses the structure and technology of the recording studio to keep lead artists and session players from commenting on one another’s performances and possibly inciting counterproductive conflict. “I’ve got the talk-back button—I’m the only one who can use it,” she says. “I let the artist tell me things in between takes, but I never pass along negative comments to the guitarist. And I don’t let the artist know if the musicians think something’s not great.” Because relationships require investment and nurturing, you need to make choices about whom you will interact with, how often, and on what terms. London Business School’s Herminia Ibarra has found that successful professionals need two types of connections: instrumental relationships, which provide professional information, sponsorship, and resources; and supportive relationships, which are built on personal trust and offer socioemotional buttressing along with dependable, high-quality feedback. Balancing the two types is particularly critical in times of uncertainty or stress, such as when you’re in line for a promotion or launching a new venture. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain that balance as you pro​gress in your career and add connections to your network; you will need to make trade-offs between breadth and depth. Heidi Roizen, a venture capitalist known for her extensive network, became much more strategic about how she spent her time and energy as she advanced. She grew more selective about whom she interacted with on a personal level and made sure that new professional ties were with people she genuinely enjoyed. Your ability to exert influence comes in part from your interactions with others—enlisting and mobilizing supporters and identifying and overcoming potential resisters. As you map your relational landscape in pursuit of a particular goal, ask yourself: Many leaders have a static view of power: Once they’ve established their influence, they assume it’s always there for the using. However, our research suggests that to maintain power, leaders must continually adapt to changes in organizational and social systems. Influence strategies that work today may fail tomorrow. Here’s how to keep up. As entrepreneurs and innovators well know, bringing a product or service to market is rarely a linear process. Offerings must be revised to reflect new perspectives, feedback, and changes in technology or competition. The same is true of the exercise of power: At points it is best to defer decisions, reflect on new information or how your efforts fit within a changing context, and revise the path ahead. Other times it is wise to step away and recharge. In such instances it’s important to think creatively about new ways to engage your target. Working with Harvard’s Lakshmi Ramarajan and Simmons’s Deborah Kolb, Kathleen studied how a professional services firm’s diversity and inclusion initiative played out over 20 years. Internal documents from the initiative revealed cycles of analysis and action—the organizational equivalent of pausing and pivoting. During periods of analysis, undertaken when results had stalled, leaders of the initiative would gather information about its challenges and ask outside experts for their interpretation of the situation. That would lead to a new phase of action. The process was continual: Because the organization, the marketplace for talent, and the diversity challenges were dynamic, each set of actions, no matter how successful at the outset, would gradually lose traction as the context evolved, necessitating a new phase of analysis. Pausing and pivoting may also be necessary on an individual level. Although Steven, the rising insurance executive described earlier, succeeded in launching his user-centered design initiative, there was a catch. Instead of appointing him to direct the project, senior leadership hired an outsider. Steven was disappointed, but he remained supportive of the effort as he turned to other tasks. His strategy of pivoting while staying engaged panned out. The new director, who lacked a deep understanding of the firm’s culture, soon departed, and Steven was offered the position. In our research we have found many instances of leaders who were passed over for promotion but pivoted while remaining engaged and visible and were eventually tapped for the desired role. Leaders must continually adapt. Influence strategies that work today may fail tomorrow. As these examples suggest, there is a meaningful distinction between pausing to pivot and avoidance. The first allows you to reconsider and reconstitute your influence attempt; the second, often arising from discomfort or an inability to effectively exercise power, means giving up your opportunity to gain influence. Each new stage in a career, each new assignment, brings a new power landscape and the opportunity to design a new influence approach. Many of the successful leaders we’ve studied engage in formal and informal experimentation, trying different approaches in similar settings and observing others’ approaches. Although you may ultimately set your sights on driving major change, the best way to begin harnessing your power is by “just doing it.” Look for small wins and share your accomplishments. Experiments are also invaluable for overcoming resistance to new ideas, as a midlevel executive at a consumer electronics company realized. He saw a strategic business opportunity: Could the firm capitalize on promising technologies that for one reason or another had not been given a green light for development? He identified several potential partners who were interested in collaborations to that end, but his firm was not equipped to set the arrangements up, and colleagues and senior executives expressed reluctance. So he decided to pilot the development model with one partner and one audio-engineering technology. This gave him evidence he could share about successes, potential pitfalls, and other lessons. With rich details from this experiment, he was able to engage colleagues, address the obstacles—real and imagined—that they had cited, and springboard a corporatewide effort to systematize strategic partnerships. People grow accustomed to the way power is distributed in their organizations, and they are more comfortable lending energy and commitment to those they know. Those dynamics can fuel resistance to new leaders. When that happens, all the lessons we’ve discussed come into play. It can help to examine how others before you have fared. Why was the previous person effective or ineffective? Are your power bases similar or different? Who are the critical brokers in your organization, and how can you establish and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with them? New leaders should understand that it may take time for people to transfer their allegiance. At a transition point in her career, Fili-Krushel, the ABC Sports executive, was seeking a new challenge. Her boss suggested she throw her hat into the ring for VP of business affairs. The executive overseeing that role didn’t know Fili-Krushel and was concerned that she wasn’t up to the job; he told her she didn’t have what it takes to negotiate big deals and proposed a different role. “I told him, ‘I don’t negotiate like you,’” she recalls. “‘There are other ways to negotiate that are more my style. Give me six months, and if you don’t think I’m doing a good job, I’ll move into the other role.’ He agreed, and that was the last I heard of the other role.” As the organizational systems and relationships around you change, you must continually reassess and modify your influence strategies. Ask yourself: The psychologist Herb Kelman identified three kinds of social influence: compliance, identification, and internalization. Power aimed at compliance affects people’s behavior in a given situation at a given time and depends on formal instruments such as policies, practices, and guidelines. Power aimed at identification is more durable and rests not on rules but on belief in the leader, who earns trust by communicating a vision, articulating goals, and tying the vision and goals to followers’ desired outcomes. It stems from leaders’ stories about themselves. Power aimed at internalization stems from stories about the organization. It may involve changing long-held language, norms, cultures, and beliefs. This is one of the most subtle and effective forms of power; people may not even realize they are being influenced. When fostering internalization, symbolism and imagery are key. They can shape the way information and events are understood and acted on, as storytellers from Homer to Steve Jobs well knew. Childers and Kaplan deftly used symbolism and storytelling when creating Chief. They invoked the metaphor of time travel to conjure a world in which C-suites are fully diverse and organizations are truly inclusive. They shared with potential funders and members their vision of an organization that would attract the energy and commitment of powerful women—one far removed from stale networking events replete with “name tags, awkward mingling in a nondescript conference room, and plastic cups of warm wine and picked-over cheese plates,” as they put it. They paid particular attention to symbolic elements of the space in which members would gather: Co-opting the idea of an “old boys club,” they opened their first clubhouse in the vibrant Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca in rooms designed to exude camaraderie and power, with hunter-green walls and classic leather armchairs. Executive women readily internalized Childers and Kaplan’s vision, not only filling membership to capacity but generating a lengthy waiting list to join.  Power is elusive and coveted, enabling and despised. It speaks to the best and the worst of human nature, evoking strong visceral feelings in those who hold it and in those under its sway. The appropriate use of power is one of the most fundamental and contentious questions of the human condition. Leaders can mobilize energy for personal gain or for collective interests; to enhance potential or destroy it. A thoughtful approach to power requires a nuanced analysis of the intended and unintended effects of influence and close attention to the means as well as the ends."
"132",132,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/data-trusts-could-be-the-key-to-better-ai","technology.txt","One of the challenges in developing AI applications is obtaining the vast amount of data that’s required. Making matters worse, regulations and privacy issues pose obstacles to firms’ sharing their data. A possible solution is for firms to form a “data trust.” that serves as a fiduciary for the data providers and governs their data’s proper use. Willis Towers Watson recently piloted a data trust together with several of its clients. This article shared what they learned about how to create such a trust. One of the greatest barriers to adopting and scaling AI applications is the scarcity of varied, high-quality raw data. To overcome it, firms need to share their data. But the many regulatory restrictions and ethical issues surrounding data privacy pose a major obstacle to doing this. A novel solution that my firm is piloting that could solve this problem is a data trust: an independent organization that serves as a fiduciary for the data providers and governs their data’s proper use. Research shows that companies are becoming increasingly aware of the value of sharing data and are exploring ways to do so with other players in their industry or across industries. Typical use cases for data sharing are fraud detection in financial services, getting greater speed and visibility across supply chains, improving product development and customer experience, and combining genetics, insurance data, and patient data to develop new digital health solutions and insights. Indeed, the research has shown that 66% of companies across all industries are willing to share data. Nevertheless, sharing sensitive company data, particularly personal customer data, is subject to strict regulatory oversight and prone to significant financial and reputational risks. A data trust that is set up as a fiduciary for the data providers could make it much easier for firms to safely share data by instituting a new way for governing the collection, processing, access, and utilization of the data. That legal and governance setup obliges the data trust administrators (the “fiduciaries”) to represent and prioritize the rights and benefits of the data providers when negotiating and contracting access to their data for use by data consumers, such as other private companies and organizations. Data trusts also can encourage data interoperability as well as the ethical and compliant governance of data — for example, by ensuring that individuals have consented to the various uses of their data (as required by regulation in several jurisdictions around the world), removing data bias, and de-identifying personal data. Moreover, by adopting a new cohort of cutting-edge technologies such as federated machine learning, homomorphic encryption, and distributed ledger technology, a data trust can guarantee transparency in data sharing as well as auditing of who is using the data at any time and for what purpose (i.e. tracking chain of custody for data), thus removing the considerable legal and technological friction that currently exists in data sharing. Data consumers who sign contracts with the trust to gain access to its data can then focus on the utility that can be derived from analyzing the data or using it to train AI algorithms without undertaking the compliance and reputational risk. They can do so either on their own (i.e., as direct data consumers) or — perhaps more powerfully — by forming “minimal viable consortia” (MVC) where data providers and data consumers share data resources and talent to focus on a specific business case. How to set up a data trust. My firm, Willis Towers Watson, recently piloted a data trust together with several of its clients. Our purpose was to test the concept and understand how to apply it in a business scenario. The three key objectives were: (1) how to identity a business case and form a successful MVC; (2) what should be the legal and ethical governance framework or frameworks to enable data sharing; and (3) understand what technologies we needed to assemble or develop in order to promote transparency and trust in the MVC. Here are some of the lessons we learned during the pilot: Develop an ethical and legal framework for data sharing. We found that it was important at the outset to set up foundational principles and aspirations to which everyone agreed. For instance, the members of the pilot MVC decided they would commit themselves to ensuring privacy of all the individuals’ data it held and delivering not only business but also social value. We worked closely with legal and privacy experts to formulate a legal framework that would ensure compliance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). And the members also decided that for the MVC to go beyond the pilot stage and be commercialized, it would need to be audited by an independent “ethics council” that would explore the ethical and other implications of the use of data and the resulting AI algorithms. Employ a federated/distributed architecture. Organizations are generally not comfortable with the idea of transferring sensitive data from their infrastructure to an external environment. We therefore looked into a federated approach, whereby data remained where it is and algorithms are distributed to the data. We investigated several privacy-preserving technologies, including differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. To ensure transparency in data governance, as well as trusted auditing and chain of custody, we also explored the application of distributed ledger technology (e.g., blockchain) as part of the technology stack. We architected the data trust as a cloud-native peer-to-peer application that would achieve data interoperability, share computational resources, and provide data scientists with a common workspace to train and test AI algorithms. The way forward. The journey to becoming a data-driven organization fit for the emerging AI economy is long and arduous. Data trusts are an opportunity for collaboration between organizations to make that journey faster, less costly, and less risky. And they can make data-monetization rewards more handsome by co-developing marketable AI applications and giving third parties controlled access to members’ data. Moreover, as we discovered during our pilot, a data trust can also help inspire creativity, cross-functional collaboration, and innovation, and can attract digital talent. As wearables, smart appliances, and 5G networks proliferate and combine into the “Intelligent Internet of Things,” data sharing and collaboration will become the norm. Data trusts can help companies make the leap to this new era. George Zarkadakis is the digital lead at Willis Towers Watson and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.

"133",133,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/ethical-frameworks-for-ai-arent-enough","technology.txt","Many organizations have adopted a set of high-level principles to ensure that their AI makes decisions in an ethical fashion and causes no harm. But to give the principles teeth, organizations need to have an implementation strategy that includes concrete metrics that can be measured and monitored by engineers, data scientists, and legal personnel. Because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to quantifying potential harms created by AI, metrics are likely to vary across organizations, use cases, and regulatory jurisdictions. But that need not discourage organizations; they can draw from a combination of existing research, legal precedents, and technical best practices. Environmental well-being. Human agency. Transparency. These are just a few of the ill-defined principles commonly listed in ethical frameworks for artificial intelligence (AI), hundreds of which have now been released by organizations ranging from Google to the government of Canada to BMW. As organizations embrace AI with increasing speed, adopting these principles is widely viewed as one of the best ways to ensure AI does not cause unintended harms. The problem? Many AI ethical frameworks cannot be clearly implemented in practice, as researchers have consistently demonstrated. Without a dramatic increase in the specificity of existing AI frameworks, there’s simply not much technical personnel can do to clearly uphold such high-level guidance. And this, in turn, means that while AI ethics frameworks may make for good marketing campaigns, they all too frequently fail to stop AI from causing the very harms they are meant to prevent. In that sense, ethics guidelines can actually pose serious risks for the companies that adopt them — creating the false sense that organizations have made their AI free of risk when its dangers are in fact rampant. If organizations think that the act of drafting AI ethical principles is enough to ensure their AI is safe, they should think again. So what can companies do to keep their AI from causing harm? The answer does not lie in abandoning ethical AI efforts altogether. Instead, organizations should ensure these frameworks are also developed in tandem with a broader strategy for ethical AI that is focused directly on implementation, with concrete metrics at the center. Every AI principle an organization adopts, in other words, should also have clear metrics that can be measured and monitored by engineers, data scientists, and legal personnel. Organizations can start with an admission: Getting serious about ethical AI is no easy task. Applying the principles of ethical AI to real-world deployment environments requires significant time and resources that span legal, data science, and risk departments and, in some cases, requires outside expertise. Indeed, because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to quantifying potential harms created by AI, metrics for ethical AI are likely to vary across organizations, use cases, and regulatory jurisdictions. There is simply no single best way to measure a principle like AI transparency or well-being. But that need not discourage organizations that are serious about ethical AI, which can draw from a combination of existing research, legal precedents, and technical best practices. In the realm of fairness, for example, there are years of case law in credit, housing, and employment law in the United States that can serve as a guide to measuring algorithmic discrimination — a topic I’ve previously addressed. Organizations may want to adopt or modify measures like adverse impact ratio, marginal effect, or standardized mean difference, which are widely used to quantify discrimination in highly-regulated fair-lending environments. Using these or similar metrics for fairness will allow data scientists to understand when and how their AI is creating discriminatory harms and to act quickly when it does. In the world of privacy, there are a host of metrics that organizations can adopt to quantify potential privacy violations as well. While there are numerous examples of research on the subject (this study is one of my favorites), a set of techniques called “privacy enhancing technologies” may be one of the best places to start for operationalizing principles related to privacy. Methods like differential privacy, which have open source packages that data scientists can adopt out of the box, are based upon the explicit notion that privacy can be quantified in large data sets and have been deployed by many tech giants for years. Similar research exists in the world of AI interpretability and security as well, which can be paired with a host of commonly espoused AI principles like transparency, robustness, and more. All of which means that as organizations engage in the difficult work of applying ethics-related metrics to their AI, they need not start from scratch. With clear metrics attached to their ethics frameworks, organizations can more easily understand when ethical failures are occurring in their AI. Are there downsides to an increased emphasis on the role of metrics in ethical AI? Surely. There are some facets of algorithmic decision-making that are hard, if not impossible, to quantify. This means that many AI deployments are likely to have intangible risks that require careful and critical review. Overemphasizing metrics can, in some circumstances, lead to overlooked risk in these areas. Additionally, it takes far more than clear metrics to ensure that AI is not generating serious harms. Mechanisms for accountability, documentation, model inventories, and more must also form major components of any efforts to deploy AI responsibly. But failing to provide clear metrics for AI harms, as is all too often the case in organizations deploying AI, breeds confusion for frontline technical and legal personnel, who require measurable indicators to understand if their AI is misbehaving and to know how to respond when it does. And while the task of translating AI principles into concrete metrics is both intellectually challenging and resource intensive, organizations adopting AI should not be daunted. Indeed, they cannot afford to be. The alternative to the challenge they face — namely, of waiting to measure the harms of AI until after they occur — will be far more difficult and costly to their consumers, their reputations, and their bottom lines. Ultimately the question is not if AI harms need to be measured but when. If organizations wait too long to quantify the damages their AI can cause, the courts will start doing it for them."
"134",134,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/ai-can-make-bank-loans-more-fair","technology.txt","Many financial institutions are turning to AI reverse past discrimination in lending, and to foster a more inclusive economy. But many lenders find that artificial-intelligence-based engines exhibit many of the same biases as humans. How can they address the issue to ensure that biases of the past are not baked into algorithms and credit decisions going forward? The key lies in building AI-driven systems designed to encourage less historic accuracy, but greater equity. That means training and testing AI systems not merely on loans or mortgages issued in the past, but instead on how the money should have been lent in a more equitable world. Armed with a deeper awareness of bias lurking in the data and with objectives that reflect both financial and social goals, we can develop AI models that do well and that do good. As banks increasingly deploy artificial intelligence tools to make credit decisions, they are having to revisit an unwelcome fact about the practice of lending: Historically, it has been riddled with biases against protected characteristics, such as race, gender, and sexual orientation. Such biases are evident in institutions’ choices in terms of who gets credit and on what terms. In this context, relying on algorithms to make credit decisions instead of deferring to human judgment seems like an obvious fix. What machines lack in warmth, they surely make up for in objectivity, right? Sadly, what’s true in theory has not been borne out in practice. Lenders often find that artificial-intelligence-based engines exhibit many of the same biases as humans. They’ve often been fed on a diet of biased credit decision data, drawn from decades of inequities in housing and lending markets. Left unchecked, they threaten to perpetuate prejudice in financial decisions and extend the world’s wealth gaps. The problem of bias is an endemic one, affecting financial services start-ups and incumbents alike. A landmark 2018 study conducted at UC Berkeley found that even though fintech algorithms charge minority borrowers 40% less on average than face-to-face lenders, they still assign extra mortgage interest to borrowers who are members of protected classes. Recently, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and some European countries issued guidelines requiring firms to promote fairness in their use of AI, including in lending. Many aspects of fairness in lending are legally regulated in the United States, but banks still have to make some choices in terms of which metrics for fairness should be prioritized or de-prioritized and how they should approach it. So how can financial institutions turning to AI reverse past discrimination and, instead, foster a more inclusive economy? In our work with financial services companies, we find the key lies in building AI-driven systems designed to encourage less historic accuracy but greater equity. That means training and testing them not merely on the loans or mortgages issued in the past, but instead on how the money should have been lent in a more equitable world. The trouble is that humans often cannot detect the unfairness that exists in the massive data sets that machine-learning systems analyze. So lenders increasingly rely on AI to identify, predict, and remove the biases against protected classes that are inadvertently baked into algorithms. Here’s how: An intuitive way to remove bias from a credit decision is to strip discrimination from the data before the model is created. But this requires more adjustment than simply removing data variables that clearly suggest gender or ethnicity, as previous bias has effects that ripple throughout. For example, samples of loan data for women are usually smaller because, proportionally, financial institutions have approved fewer and smaller loans to women in decades past than to men with equivalent credit scores and income. This leads to more frequent errors and false inferences for the under-represented and differentially treated female applicants. Manual interventions to attempt to correct the bias in data can also end up in self-fulfilling prophecies, as mistakes or assumptions made may be repeated and amplified. To avoid this, banks can now use AI to spot and correct patterns of historic discrimination against women in raw data, compensating for changes over time by deliberately altering this data to give an artificial, more equitable probability of approval. For example, by using AI, one lender discovered that, historically, women would need to earn 30% more than men on average for equivalent-sized loans to be approved. It used AI to retroactively balance the data that went into developing and testing its AI-driven credit decision model by shifting the female distribution, moving the proportion of loans previously made to women to be closer to the same amount as for men with an equivalent risk profile, while retaining the relative ranking. As a result of the fairer representation of how loan decisions should have been made, the algorithm developed was able to approve loans more in line with how the bank wished to extend credit more equitably in the future. Yet even after data is adjusted, banks can often need an extra layer of defense to prevent bias, or remaining traces of its effects, from creeping in. To achieve this, they “regularize” an algorithm so that it aims not just to fit historical data, but also to score well on some measure of fairness. They do this by including an extra parameter that penalizes the model if it treats protected classes differently. For example, one bank discovered by applying AI that very young and very old applicants were not getting equal access to credit. To encourage fairer credit decisions, the bank designed a model that required its algorithm to minimize an unfairness score. The score was based on the gap between outcomes for people in different age brackets with the same risk profile, including intersections between subgroups, such as older women. By taking this approach, the final AI-driven model could close the mathematical gap between how similar people from different groups are treated by 20%. Even after correcting the data and regularizing the model, it is still possible to have an apparently neutral model which continues to have a disparate impact on protected and non-protected classes. So many financial institutions go one more step and build an additional, so-called “adversarial” AI-driven model to see if it can predict protected-class bias in decisions made by the first model. If the adversarial challenger successfully detects any protected characteristic such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, marital status or age, from the way the first credit model treats an applicant, then the original model is corrected. For example, adversarial AI-driven models can often detect ethnic minority zip codes from the outputs of a proposed credit model. This can often be due to a confounding interaction with lower salaries being associated with overlapping zip codes. Indeed, we have seen adversarial models show that an original model is likely to offer lower limits to applications from zip codes associated with an ethnic minority, even if the original model or data available did not have race or ethnicity as an input to check against. In the past, these issues would have been dealt with by attempting to manually change the original model’s parameters. But now we can use AI as an automated approach to re-tune the model to increase the influence of variables which contribute to equity and reduce those that contribute to bias, partially by aggregating segments, until the challenger model is no longer able to predict ethnicity by using zip codes as a proxy. In one instance, this resulted in a model that still differentiated between zip codes but reduced the mortgage approval rate gap for some ethnicities by as much as 70%. To be sure, financial institutions should lend wisely, based on whether people are willing and able to pay debt. But lenders must not treat people differently if they have similar risk profiles, whether that decision is made by artificial neural networks or by human brains. Reducing bias is not just a socially responsible pursuit — it also makes for more profitable business. The early movers in reducing bias through AI will have a real competitive advantage on top of doing their moral duty. Algorithms can’t tell us which definitions of fairness to use or which groups to protect. Left to their own devices, machine-learning systems may cement the very biases we want them to eliminate. But AI need not go unchecked. Armed with a deeper awareness of bias lurking in the data and with objectives that reflect both financial and social goals, we can develop models that do well and that do good. There is measurable evidence that lending decisions based on machine-learning systems vetted and adjusted by the steps outlined above are fairer than those made previously by people. One decision at a time, these systems are forging a more financially equitable world."
"135",135,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-ibm-is-working-toward-a-fairer-ai","technology.txt","It’s difficult to keep human biases from creeping into AI. But there are steps that companies can take address this growing challenge. This article focuses on what IBM has done to advance fairer, more transparent, and more accurate AI, and what other companies can learn from them. First, create an effective AI ethics board. Then, clearly define the company’s policies around AI. Work with trusted partners to advance ethics in AI. And contribute open-source toolkits that allow developers to share and receive state-of-the-art codes and datasets related to AI bias detection and mitigation. This allows the developer community to collaborate with one another and discuss various notions of bias. Beyond that, ensure that you have a diverse team, and that you’re devoting resources to education and awareness initiatives for designers, developers, and managers. Be sure to include consultations with relevant social organizations and the impacted communities to identify the most appropriate definition of fairness for your AI.  And build transparency and explainability tools to recognize the presence of bias and its impact on your AI system’s decisions. Humans have many kinds of biases. To name just a few, we suffer from confirmation bias, which means that we tend to focus on information that confirms our preconceptions about a topic; from anchoring bias, where we make decisions mostly relying on the first piece of information we receive on that subject; and from gender bias, where we tend to associate women with certain traits, activities, or professions, and men with others. When we make decisions, these types of biases often creep in unconsciously, resulting in decisions that are ultimately unfair and unobjective. These same types of bias can show up in artificial intelligence (AI), especially when using machine learning techniques to program an AI system. A commonly-used technique called “supervised machine learning” requires that AI systems be trained with a large number of examples of problems and solutions. For example, if we want to build an AI system that can decide when to accept or reject a loan application, we would train it with many examples of loan applications, and for each application, we would give it the correct decision (either accept or reject the application). The AI system would find useful correlations in such examples and use them to make (hopefully correct) decisions on new loan applications. After the training phase, a test phase on another set of examples checks that the system is accurate enough and ready for deployment. However, if the training dataset is not balanced, inclusive, or representative enough of the dimensions of the problem we want to solve, the AI system may become biased. For example, if all accepted loan applications in the training dataset are related to men and all rejected ones are related to women, then the system will pick up the correlation between gender and acceptability as a form of bias and will use this bias when making decisions on new applications going forward. Another example of how bias creeps into AI training datasets happens when we include many more data points for one group compared to another. In this case, the AI system’s accuracy will probably be different for the two groups, since the AI could learn better (by exploiting more information) for one of the two groups. In domains with high-stakes decisions — such as in the financial sector, healthcare, or the judicial domain — using an AI system with bias can lead to decisions that favor one group of people over another one. This is not acceptable, especially when the decisions may significantly impact lives. Currently, there are algorithms that can detect and mitigate bias in AI systems. However, the AI bias space is incredibly complex, and different data types (images, text, speech, structured data) require different techniques for detecting bias in the training dataset. Bias can also be injected in other phases of the AI development pipeline, not just in the training dataset. For example, consider an AI system that’s supposed to identify the main reason for a loan request — such as buying a house, paying for schools fees, and paying for legal fees — with the goal being to prioritize some of those categories above others, as determined by the developers. If the developers omit one of the reasons why people apply for a loan, people with that motivation would be penalized. So, what can we do to fix this growing challenge? Here’s what we’ve done at IBM to advance fairer, more transparent, and more accurate AI: These efforts, born at IBM Research, have also led to innovative business solutions for IBM clients. In 2018, IBM released Watson OpenScale, a commercial offering designed to build AI-based solutions for enterprises and helps them detect, manage, and mitigate AI bias. While solutions like these help, they alone are not enough to assure that deployed AI systems do not have unwanted bias built into them. Often, developers are not even aware of the kind of bias their models have, and they may not have the knowledge to identify what’s fair and appropriate for a certain scenario. To tackle this, there are multiple initiatives businesses can and should focus on: Overall, only a multi-dimensional and multi-stakeholder approach can truly address AI bias by defining a values-driven approach, where values such as fairness, transparency, and trust are the center of creation and decision-making around AI. By doing so, not only can we avoid creating AI that replicates or amplifies our own biases, but we can also use AI to help humans themselves be more fair. The ultimate goal, of course, is not to advance AI, per se, but to advance human beings and our values through the use of technologies including AI."
"136",136,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/a-simple-tactic-that-could-help-reduce-bias-in-ai","technology.txt","It’s been well-established that AI-driven systems are subject to the biases of their human creators — we unwittingly “bake” biases into systems by training them on biased data or with “rules” created by experts with implicit biases. But it doesn’t have to be this way. The good news is that more strategic use of AI systems — through “blind taste tests” — can give us a fresh chance to identify and remove decision biases from the underlying algorithms even if we can’t remove them completely from our own habits of mind. That is, we can simply deny the algorithm the information suspected of biasing the outcome to ensure it makes predictions blind to that variable. Breaking the cycle of bias in this way has the potential to promote greater equality across contexts — from business to science to the arts — on dimensions including gender, race, socioeconomic status, and others. It’s easier to program bias out of a machine than out of a mind. That’s an emerging conclusion of research-based findings — including my own — that could lead to AI-enabled decision-making systems being less subject to bias and better able to promote equality. This is a critical possibility, given our growing reliance on AI-based systems to render evaluations and decisions in high-stakes human contexts, in everything from court decisions, to hiring, to access to credit, and more. It’s been well-established that AI-driven systems are subject to the biases of their human creators — we unwittingly “bake” biases into systems by training them on biased data or with “rules” created by experts with implicit biases. Consider the Allegheny Family Screening Tool (AFST), an AI-based system predicting the likelihood a child is in an abusive situation using data from the same-named Pennsylvania county’s Department of Human Services — including records from public agencies related to child welfare, drug and alcohol services, housing, and others. Caseworkers use reports of potential abuse from the community, along with whatever publicly-available data they can find for the family involved, to run the model, which predicts a risk score from 1 to 20; a sufficiently high score triggers an investigation. Predictive variables include factors such as receiving mental health treatment, accessing cash welfare assistance, and others. Sounds logical enough, but there’s a problem — a big one. By multiple accounts, the AFST has built-in human biases. One of the largest is that the system heavily weights past calls about families, such as from healthcare-providers, to the community hotline — and evidence suggests such calls are over three times more likely to involve Black and biracial families than white ones. Though multiple such calls are ultimately screened out, the AFST relies on them in assigning a risk score, resulting in potentially racially-biased investigations if callers to the hotline are more likely to report Black families than non-Black families, all else being equal. This can result in an ongoing, self-fulfilling, and self-perpetuating prophecy where the training data of an AI system can reinforce its misguided predictions, influencing future decisions and institutionalizing the bias. It doesn’t have to be this way. More strategic use of AI systems — through what I call “blind taste tests” — can give us a fresh chance to identify and remove decision biases from the underlying algorithms even if we can’t remove them completely from our own habits of mind. Breaking the cycle of bias in this way has the potential to promote greater equality across contexts — from business to science to the arts — on dimensions including gender, race, socioeconomic status, and others. Blind taste tests have been around for decades. Remember the famous Pepsi Challenge from the mid-1970s? When people tried Coca-Cola and Pepsi “blind” — no labels on the cans — the majority preferred Pepsi over its better-selling rival. In real life, though, simply knowing it was Coke created a bias in favor of the product; removing the identifying information — the Coke label — removed the bias so people could rely on taste alone. In a similar blind test from the same time period, wine experts preferred California wines over their French counterparts, in what became known as the “Judgment of Paris.” Again, when the label is visible, the results are very different, as experts ascribe more sophistication and subtlety to the French wines — simply because they’re French — indicating the presence of bias yet again. So it’s easy to see how these blind taste tests can diminish bias in humans by removing key identifying information from the evaluation process. But a similar approach can work with machines. That is, we can simply deny the algorithm the information suspected of biasing the outcome, just as they did in the Pepsi Challenge, to ensure that it makes predictions blind to that variable. In the AFST example, the “blind taste test” could work like this: train the model on all data, including referral calls from the community. Then re-train the model on all the data except that one. If the model’s predictions are equally good without referral-call information, it means the model makes predictions that are blind to that factor. But if the predictions are different when those calls are included, it indicates that either the calls represent a valid explanatory variable in the model, or there may be potential bias in the data (as has been argued for the AFST) that should be examined further before relying on the algorithm. This process breaks the self-perpetuating, self-fulfilling prophecy that existed in the human system without AI, and keeps it out of the AI system. My research with Kellogg collaborators Yang Yang and Youyou Wu demonstrated a similar anti-bias effect in a different domain: the replicability of scientific papers. What separates science from superstition is that a scientific fact that is found in the lab or a clinical trial replicates out in the real world again and again. When it comes to evaluating the replicability — or reproducibility — of published scientific results, we humans struggle. Some replication failure is expected or even desirable because science involves experimentation of unknowns. However, an estimated 68% of studies published in medicine, biology, and social science papers do not replicate. Replication failures continue to be unknowingly cited in the literature, driving up R&D costs by an estimated $28 billion annually and slowing discoveries of vaccines and therapies for Covid-19 and other conditions. The problem is related to bias: when scientists and researchers review a manuscript for publication, they focus on a paper’s statistical and other quantitative results in judging replicability. That is, they use the numbers in a scientific paper much more than the paper’s narrative, which describes the numbers, in making this assessment. Human reviewers are also influenced by institutional labels (e.g., Cambridge University), scientific discipline labels (physicists are smart), journal names, and other status biases. To address this issue, we trained a machine-learning model to estimate a paper’s replicability using only the paper’s reported statistics (typically used by human reviewers), narrative text (not typically used), or a combination of these. We studied 2 million abstracts from scientific papers and over 400 manually-replicated studies from 80 journals. The AI model using only the narrative predicted replicability better than the statistics. It also predicted replicability better than the base rate of individual reviewers, and as well as “prediction markets,” where collective intelligence of hundreds of researchers is used to assess a paper’s replicability, a very costly approach. Importantly, we then used the blind taste test approach and showed that our model’s predictions weren’t biased by factors including topic, scientific discipline, journal prestige, or persuasion words like “unexpected” or “remarkable.” The AI model provided predictions of replicability at scale and without known human biases. In a subsequent extension of this work (in progress), we again used an AI system to reexamine the scientific papers in the study that had inadvertently published numbers and statistics that contained mistakes that the reviewers hadn’t caught during the review process, likely due to our general tendency to believe figures we are shown. Again, a system blind to variables that can promote bias when over-weighted in the review process — quantitative evidence, in this case — was able to render a more objective evaluation than humans alone could, catching mistakes missed due to bias. Together, the findings provide strong evidence for the value of creating blind taste tests for AI systems, to reduce or remove bias and promote fairer decisions and outcomes across contexts. The blind-taste-test concept can be applied effectively to reduce bias in multiple domains well beyond the world of science. Consider earnings calls led by business C-suite teams to explain recent and projected financial performance to analysts, shareholders, and others. Audience members use the content of these calls to predict future company performance, which can have large, swift impact on share prices and other key outcomes. But again, human listeners are biased to use the numbers presented — just as in judging scientific replicability — and to pay excessive attention to who is sharing the information (a well-known CEO like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk versus someone else). Moreover, companies have an incentive to spin the information to create more favorable impressions. An AI system can look beyond potential bias-inducing information to factors including the “text” of the call (words rather than numbers) and others such as the emotional tone detected, to render more objective inputs for decision-making. We are currently examining earnings-call data with this hypothesis in mind, along with studying specific issues such as whether the alignment between numbers presented and the verbal description of those numbers has an equal effect on analysts’ evaluations if the speaker is male or female. Will human evaluators give men more of a pass in the case of misalignment? If we find evidence of bias, it will indicate that denying gender information to an AI system can yield more equality-promoting judgments and decisions related to earnings calls. We are also applying the ideas here to the patents domain, where patent applications involve a large investment and rejection rates are as high as 50%. Here, current models used to predict a patent application’s success or a patent’s expected value don’t perform much better than chance, and tend to use factors like whether an individual or team filed the application, again suggesting potential bias. We are studying the value of using AI systems to examine patent text, to yield more effective, fairer judgments. There are many more potential applications of the blind-taste-test approach. What if interviews for jobs or assessments for promotions or tenure took place with some kind of blinding mechanism in place, preventing the biased use of gender, race, or other variables in decisions? What about decisions for which startup founders receive funding, where gender bias has been evident? What if judgments about who received experimental medical treatments were stripped of potential bias-inducing variables? To be clear, I’m not suggesting that we use machines as our sole decision-making mechanisms. After all, humans can also intentionally program decision-making AI systems to manipulate information. Still, our involvement is critical to form hypotheses about where bias may enter in the first place, and to create the right blind taste tests to avoid it. Thus, an integration of human and AI systems is the optimal approach. In sum, it’s fair to conclude that the human condition inherently includes the presence of bias. But increasing evidence suggests we can minimize or overcome that by programming bias out of the machine-based systems we use to make critical decisions, creating a more equal playing field for all."
"137",137,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/4-things-to-consider-before-you-start-using-ai-in-personnel-decisions","technology.txt","Which candidate should we hire? Who should be promoted? How should we choose which people get which shifts? In the hope of making better and fairer decisions about personnel matters such as these, companies have increasingly adopted AI tools only to discover that they may have biases as well. How can we decide whether to keep human managers or go with AI? This article offers four considerations. The initial promise of artificial intelligence as a broad-based tool for solving business problems has given way to something much more limited but still quite useful: algorithms from data science that make predictions better than we have been able to do so far. In contrast to standard statistical models that focus on one or two factors already known to be associated with an outcome like job performance, machine-learning algorithms are agnostic about which variables have worked before or why they work. The more the merrier: It throws them all together and produces one model to predict some outcome like who will be a good hire, giving each applicant a single, easy-to-interpret score as to how likely it is that they will perform well in a job. No doubt because the promise of these algorithms was so great, the recognition of their limitations has also gotten a lot of attention, especially given the fact that if the initial data used to build the model is biased, then the algorithm generated from that data will perpetuate that bias. The best-known examples have been in organizations that discriminated against women in the past where job performance data is also biased, and that means algorithms based on that data will also be biased. So how should employers proceed as they contemplate adopting AI to make personnel decisions? Here are four considerations: 1. The algorithm may be less biased than the existing practices that generate the data in the first place. Let’s not romanticize how poor human judgment is and how disorganized most of our people management practices are now. When we delegate hiring to individual supervisors, for example, it is quite likely that they may each have lots of biases in favor of and against candidates based on attributes that have nothing to do with good performance: Supervisor A may favor candidates who graduated from a particular college because she went there, while Supervisor B may do the reverse because he had a bad experience with some of its graduates. At least algorithms treat everyone with the same attributes equally, albeit not necessarily fairly. 2. We may not have good measures of all of the outcomes we would like to predict, and we may not know how to weight the various factors in making final decisions. For example, what makes for a “good employee”? They have to accomplish their tasks well, they also should get along with colleagues well, fit in with the “culture,” stay with us and not quit, and so forth. Focusing on just one aspect where we have measures will lead to a hiring algorithm that selects on that one aspect, often when it does not relate closely to other aspects, such as a salesperson who is great with customers but miserable with co-workers. Here again, it isn’t clear that what we are doing now is any better: An individual supervisor making a promotion decision may be able in theory to consider all those criteria, but each assessment is loaded with bias, and the way they are weighted is arbitrary. We know from rigorous research that the more hiring managers use their own judgment in these matters, the worse their decisions are. 3. The data that AI uses may raise moral issues. Algorithms that predict turnover, for example, now often rely on data from social media sites, such as Facebook postings. We may decide that it is an invasion of privacy to gather such data about our employees, but not using it comes at the price of models that will predict less well. It may also be the case that an algorithm does a good job overall in predicting something for the average employee but does a poor job for some subset of employees. It might not be surprising, for example, to find that the hiring models that pick new salespeople do not work well at picking engineers. Simply having separate models for each would seem to be the solution. But what if the different groups are men and women or whites and African Americans, as appears to be the case? In those cases, legal constraints prevent us from using different practices and different hiring models for different demographic groups. 4. It is often hard, if not impossible, to explain and justify the criteria behind algorithmic decisions. In most workplaces now, we at least have some accepted criteria for making employment decisions: He got the opportunity because he has been here longer; she was off this weekend because she had that shift last weekend; this is the way we have treated people before. If I don’t get the promotion or the shift I want, I can complain to the person who made the decision. He or she has a chance to explain the criterion and may even help me out next time around if the decision did not seem perfectly fair. When we use algorithms to drive those decisions, we lose the ability to explain to employees how those decisions were made. The algorithm simply pulls together all the available information to construct extremely complicated models that predict past outcomes. It would be highly unlikely if those outcomes corresponded to any principle that we could observe or explain other than to say, “The overall model says this will work best.” The supervisor can’t help explain or address fairness concerns. Especially where such models do not perform much better than what we are already doing, it is worth asking whether the irritation they will cause employees is worth the benefit. The advantage, say, of just letting the most senior employee get first choice in picking his or her schedule is that this criterion is easily understood, it corresponds with at least some accepted notions of fairness, it is simple to apply, and it may have some longer-term benefits, such as increasing the rewards for sticking around. There may be some point where algorithms will be able to factor in issues like this, but we are nowhere close to that now. Algorithmic models are arguably no worse than what we are doing now. But their fairness problems are easier to spot because they happen at scale. The way to solve them is to get more and better measures — data that is not biased. Doing that would help even if we were not using machine-learning algorithms to make personnel decisions. Peter Cappelli is the George W. Taylor Professor of Management at the Wharton School and a director of its Center for Human Resources. He is the author of several books, including Will College Pay Off?

"138",138,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/do-algorithms-make-better-and-fairer-investments-than-angel-investors","technology.txt","Can an algorithm outperform the average angel investor? And if it can, does that also mean it will make less biased investments? Researchers put these questions to the test: They built an investing algorithm and put it head to head with 255 angel investors in a simulation, asking it to select the most promising investment opportunities among 623 deals from one of the largest European angel networks. The results? The algorithm significantly outperformed the average novice investor and even experienced investors who fell prey to cognitive biases, but was bested by the top tier of experienced investors, who could control for their own biases. While the algorithm may have made less biased choices when it came to the race and gender of the founders it picked, it also reflected systemic inequalities, and illustrated the limits of how algorithmic investing can be used to address deep social inequalities. Even so, the experiment offers a vision for how — and when — investors might deploy similar algorithmic aids in their investing, and how it might lead to better and fairer decisions. Many large venture capital funds use artificial intelligence (AI) to support their investment decisions. Bill Maris, former managing partner at Google Ventures, once said that when you “have access to the world’s largest data sets … it would be foolish to just go out and make gut investments.” Most startup investors, however, do not have access to Google-esque resources and still do things the old-fashioned way. Angel investors, for instance, rely heavily on gut feeling to make investments. But as technology advances and the cost of building powerful algorithms through machine learning decreases, these investors will need to decide whether to incorporate AI. Can it outperform human judgment in making early stage investment decisions? And how should angel investors use it? To answer these questions, we built an investment algorithm and compared its performance with the returns of 255 angel investors. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we trained the algorithm to select the most promising investment opportunities among 623 deals from one of the largest European angel networks. The algorithm’s decisions were based on the same data that was available to the angel investors at the time, which included pitch material, social media profiles, websites, and so on. We used this data to predict a startup’s survival prospects — instead of measures such as valuation, which investors often favor — because it allowed us to train the algorithm with a much larger and more reliable dataset. For our test, we used this prediction model to simulate investments and to compare the returns of the angel investors’ portfolios against the ones that were created by the algorithm. We further investigated how angel investors of varying experience — novices with fewer than 10 investments vs. expert investors with at least 10 investments — faired relative to the algorithm’s performance. Expert angel investors in our sample, on average, made about twice as many investments as novices (12.2 vs. 5.2) and invested double the amount per startup (€10,530 vs. €4,548). The results were striking, and offer significant insight into how — and when — algorithmic investing tools might be used to maximum advantage. According to our research, novice investors are easily outperformed by the algorithm — with their limited investment experience, they showed much higher signs of cognitive biases in their decision making. Experienced investors, however, faired far better. As such, our research shows how biases shape the decisions of human investors — and how working with algorithms might help produce better and fairer investment returns. It has been well documented that cognitive biases — meaning systematic deviations from rational behavior — lead to inferior investment performance. We measured five biases: 1) local bias, which describes angel investors’ tendency to make investments that are in close geographic proximity to themselves; 2) loss aversion, meaning angel investors’ tendency to be more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains; 3) overconfidence, when investors “overcommitted” and spent significantly more money on one startup that they usually would; 4) gender bias; and 5) racial bias. Our data shows that all biases were present among the angel investors with overconfidence — which 91% fell prey to at least once — being the most frequent and strongest bias to affect investment returns. Because cognitive biases cause investors to make irrational investment decisions, it is not surprising that our investment algorithm outperformed the human average. While the algorithm achieved an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 7.26%, the 255 angel investors — on average — yielded IRRs of 2.56%. Put another way, the algorithm produced an increase of more than 184% over the human average. Not all investors are equally susceptible to their biases, however. For instance, angel investors with lower signs of irrational behavior in their portfolios performed significantly better than their rather irrational counterparts: the less biased novice group averaged 3.51%, whereas the novice group with higher biases, on average, lost money at -20.52% IRR. Intrigued by these results, we investigated whether the algorithm would win even when the investors were highly experienced. What we found is that experienced angel investors showed far fewer signs of cognitive biases and therefore achieved significantly better investment returns. This elite group of experienced angel investors achieved an average IRR of 22.75%. Experience alone, however, does not do the trick: Investors who had a good deal of experience but also showed high levels of cognitive biases achieved, on average, only 2.87% IRR. Our results thus show that only experienced investors who can suppress their cognitive biases effectively outperform machine learning algorithms in making early stage investment decisions. There was one other factor we found to be at play, which may give algorithms an edge. Achieving higher portfolio returns in venture investing has two sides – protecting the downside and increasing the upside. A central thesis and the main focus of venture investing has always been to find statistical outliers (i.e., “unicorns”); our study, however, gives reason to rethink this central investment hypothesis in angel investing. By predicting survival probabilities, the algorithm was able to pick much better portfolios than the large majority of the 255 angel investors. As such, our data suggests that in the greater scheme of things, it might actually be more important to avoid a bad investment than to try to hit a home run. Given their limited funds, angels only invest in a finite amount of ventures and must, therefore, take great care with each investment. Therefore, asking “is this a viable business with very high chances of survival?” might be more valuable in achieving higher portfolio returns than searching for the needle in the haystack. There has been ample discussion about whether algorithms are biased by their creators. In our case, the outcomes in the training data were not classified by humans directly (compared, say, to hiring algorithms, where humans decide who has been a good hire in the past). The algorithm was trained on actual survival and performance data of hundreds of ventures. Given this high degree of objectivity, we see that compared to the average investor, the algorithm’s portfolio selection was less influenced by classical investment biases such as loss aversion or overconfidence. That doesn’t mean it didn’t show bias, however. We were surprised to see that the algorithm did tend towards picking white entrepreneurs rather than entrepreneurs of color and preferred investing in startups with male founders. Given these specific results, we can say that the current controversial discussion around biased algorithms that are being blamed for making unfair decisions is overly simplistic and misses the underlying problem of inflated expectations. Machine learning models are frequently trained to discriminate between different decision alternatives, e.g., good or bad early stage investments. AI itself is, per default, not irrational or biased; it just extrapolates patterns that exist in the real world data that we give it to learn and to exploit these patterns in order to distinguish between the potential decision alternatives. Thus, AI may be able to counter the flawed decision-making processes of individual investors with low investment experience, e.g., it may help correct investors that overestimate their ability to assess the risk of a given investment. However, using AI as a means for fighting societal inequalities is more challenging. Although all data sources were objective and free of human judgement in our case — and the algorithm was not fed race and gender data — it still came to biased decisions. But the algorithm itself did not make biased decisions; it reproduced societal inequalities that were inherent in our training data. For example, one of the most important factors on which the algorithm based its predictions was prior funding that the startup had received. Recent research shows that women are disadvantaged in the funding process and ultimately raise less venture capital which may lead to their startups not being as successful. In other words, the societal mechanisms that make ventures of female and non-white founders die at an earlier stage are just projected by the AI into a vicious cycle of future discrimination. Importantly, our results indicate that consciously debiasing decisions for race and gender might increase not only fairness, but also performance of early stage investment decisions. For instance, we found that experienced investors that invest in ventures of non-white founders systematically outperformed our algorithm. Thus, these experienced investors made successful investment decisions that were free of the implicit patterns of discrimination that undermined the results of our algorithm. In general, there is always a tradeoff between fairness and efficiency in resource allocation. This tradeoff is also apparent in algorithmic decision making. We can never expect AI to have a built-in solution to automatically solve societal problems that are inherent in the data that we feed it. Our research underscores the advantages of using AI in early stage investing. It can process large amounts of data, correct individual investment biases, and, on average, outperform its human counterpart. At the same time, the most successful individuals — experienced investors able to correct for their cognitive biases — outperform the algorithm in terms of both efficiency and fairness. Of course, this doesn’t have to be a binary choice between gut feeling and algorithmic decisions. Managers and investors should consider that algorithms produce predictions about potential future outcomes rather than decisions. Depending on how predictions are intended to be used, they are based on human judgement that may (or may not) result in improved decision making and action. In complex and uncertain decision environments, the central question is, thus, not whether human decision making should be replaced, but rather how it should be augmented by combining the strengths of human and artificial intelligence — an idea that has been referred to as hybrid intelligence. Artificial intelligence in the loop. Our research shows that algorithms could help novice investors in making early-stage investment decisions. To start angel investing with the help of an algorithm enables novice investors to avoid decision caveats and thus to achieve higher returns early in their investment career, which encourages them to continue investing. Angels who keep investing provide important resources to an ecosystem that fosters job creation and innovation. Therefore, we see lots of potential in investment algorithms to train novice investors in making expert-like decisions that result in improved financial returns. Human intelligence in the loop. For more experienced angel investors who have learned to manage their cognitive biases, our findings show that their intuition should still be considered the gold standard of early-stage investing. So, algorithms should not only be trained on “objective” past performance data that easily reproduce societal biases, but also on the decisions and actions of these selected decision makers. Therefore, at same time, we see potential in experienced investors to train investment algorithms to make better and fairer investment decisions. In the end, despite AI is rapidly entering the financial markets, best-in-class early-stage investments are still dominated by experienced angel investors. The key to building an investment algorithm that can ultimately replace even the most experienced angel investors in making their investment decisions does not only lie in counteracting human biases but also in mimicking experts’ intuition in finding the most promising investment opportunities.

"139",139,"https://hbr.org/2020/11/rethinking-the-on-demand-workforce","technology.txt","As companies struggle with chronic skills shortages and changing labor demographics, a new generation of talent platforms, offering on-demand access to highly trained workers, has begun to help. These platforms include marketplaces for premium expertise (such as Toptal and Catalant), for freelance workers (Upwork and 99designs), and for crowdsourcing innovation (Kaggle and InnoCentive). Almost all Fortune 500 firms use such platforms. But most do so in an ad hoc, inefficient way, according to a Harvard Business School/BCG study. Companies need to get much more strategic about their engagement with talent platforms and fully embrace their ability to increase labor force flexibility, speed time to market, and facilitate business model innovation. That will require rewiring policies and processes and redefining working norms. Most important, leaders must inspire the cultural shift needed to realize the platforms’ transformative potential. Thanks to rapid automation, digital transformation, and demographic change, it’s harder than ever for companies to find people with the right skills at the right time. Digital talent platforms now offer companies on-demand access to highly skilled workers. Almost all Fortune 500 companies make use of these platforms, but mainly on an ad hoc basis. The process is costly, inefficient, and decidedly not strategic. In newly strategic ways, companies need to embrace the full potential of digital talent platforms and the on-demand workforce. Doing so will allow them to create new business models and unlock new sources of value. In this era of chronic skills shortages,  rapid automation, and digital transformation, companies are confronting a growing talent problem, one that has the potential to become a strategic bottleneck. How can they find people with the right skills to do the right work at just the right time? The half-life of skills is shrinking fast, and many jobs now come and go in a matter of years. Not only that, but major demographic changes are under way: Boomers are aging out of the workforce, and Millennials and Gen Z are taking over, bringing with them very different priorities about who should do what work—and where, when, and how it should get done.   To help companies address these challenges, a new generation of talent platforms—such as Catalant, InnoCentive, Kaggle, Toptal, and Upwork—has emerged. In contrast to Uber, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and TaskRabbit, these platforms offer on-demand access to highly skilled workers, and our research shows that their number has risen substantially since 2009, from roughly 80 to more than 330. Much of that growth took place during the past five years alone. Today almost all Fortune 500 companies use one or more of them. Platforms that provide workers who have four-year college degrees or advanced degrees represent an increasingly important but understudied element of the emerging gig economy. To better understand this phenomenon, we undertook a survey of nearly 700 U.S. businesses that use them. We then conducted in-depth interviews with many corporate leaders whose companies are relying on the platforms and with platform founders and executives. That companies are leveraging high-skills platforms in large numbers came as no surprise to us, because in recent years we’ve seen how they can increase labor force flexibility, accelerate time to market, and enable innovation. We were impressed, however, by the variety of engagements that companies are making with the platforms. They’re seeking help with projects that are short- and long-term, tactical and strategic, specialized and general. What’s more, 90% of the leaders we surveyed—C-suite and frontline—believe these platforms will be core to their ability to compete in the future. But here’s what did surprise us: Despite the extent to which companies are now turning to such platforms, very few firms have developed a cohesive organization-wide approach to their use. Instead, operational frontline leaders who are desperate to get things done have been reaching out to them on an ad hoc basis, often without any central guidance. This approach is costly, inefficient, and opaque. To compete in the years ahead, companies must do better. They’ll have to acknowledge and embrace the full potential of digital talent platforms—which is to say, figure out how to engage strategically with what you might call the on-demand workforce. Though millions of workers were laid off this past spring, in the coming months employers will begin to rehire—and when they do, they’ll need to be more purposeful about their approach to talent. How can they access hard-to-find expertise? Which positions or roles have changed, and what new capabilities are required? What work can be done more successfully and efficiently by skilled freelancers? In an environment of ongoing uncertainty, employers will be even more attracted to the freelance route for a variety of reasons: It makes hiring easier for hard-to-fill jobs, offers access to a wider set of skills, reduces head count, and allows more flexibility during times of change. In this article we’ll take stock of where most companies now stand on this front. We’ll show how some pioneers are speeding ahead to take advantage of what the new talent platforms have to offer, and we’ll explain how you and your management team can do the same. As the gig economy has grown, three kinds of platforms have emerged: These platforms, which include Toptal and Catalant, allow companies to easily source high-end niche experts—anybody from big-data scientists to strategic project managers and even interim CEOs and CFOs. Toptal, for example, claims it culls the “top 3%” of freelancers from across the globe. Experts might be hired for strategic initiatives or embedded in teams, and the projects they’re assigned to can range in length from a few hours to more than a year. The Covid-19 crisis is increasingly turning companies toward this kind of platform: Consider that this past spring Catalant reported a 250% increase in demand for supply chain expertise. (Full disclosure: Coauthor Joseph Fuller is an adviser to Catalant’s board of directors.) These platforms, which include Upwork, Freelancer, and 99designs, match individuals with companies for discrete task-oriented projects—designing a logo, say, or translating a legal document. For example, when Amazon wanted to explore creating custom social-media content for its new TV shows, it tested the waters with Tongal, which connects companies to individuals with media know-how. Many freelance platforms offer access to workers from around the world with a wide variety of skills, and payment is often per completed task. Covid-19 is accelerating the move toward these platforms, too: As large swaths of society began working remotely, Upwork saw a spike in demand for digital marketing expertise from companies trying to reach consumers in their homes. These platforms, which include InnoCentive and Kaggle, allow companies to post problems among large communities of technically sophisticated users—and reach a far broader base of them than could ever be found or developed in-house. The challenges run the gamut from simple coding projects to complex engineering dilemmas. Working with the platforms, companies often create competitions and offer prizes for the best solutions. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration, for example, ran a $1.5 million competition on Kaggle to help improve the algorithms that predict threats using images from airport scanning equipment. Enel, the Italian multinational energy company, uses multiple crowdsourcing platforms to generate ideas for a host of issues: how to improve recruiting and even what to do with defunct thermal plants. And the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has turned to InnoCentive’s “solvers” to develop molecules used in genetic research and testing. Millions of well-qualified Americans today are attracted to contract work. Freelancers are now estimated to make up roughly a third of the U.S. workforce, and those who are highly skilled represent a small but growing slice of it. And for the first time since 2014, the number of freelancers who say they consider gig work to be a long-term career choice is the same as the number who consider it a temporary way to make money. Early signs suggest that Covid-19 will also speed up this shift. Much of the shift is the result of demographic changes that have been under way for four or five decades but that traditional organizations have done little to recognize or address. There are at least four key trends: Single-parent and sandwich-generation families are on the rise. Burdened with childcare and eldercare, many employees are dropping out of the workforce or struggling to manage full-time jobs. Gigs allow them the flexibility to handle their family obligations while delivering quality work. Women’s participation in the U.S. labor force has been declining steadily since 2000. Highly skilled, experienced women who take time off to have children and for other life events are finding it difficult to restart their careers or are seeing themselves get sidetracked in traditional organizations. According to a 2009 Center for Work-Life Policy survey, more than two-thirds of “highly qualified” women—that is, those with advanced degrees or high-honors BAs—who drop out of the workforce would not have done so if they’d had access to more-flexible job arrangements. Online talent platforms allow them to more smoothly reenter the workforce and advance their careers. The number of freelancers who say they consider gig work to be a long-term career choice is the same as the number who consider it a temporary way to make money. Workers who are laid off or edged out of traditional firms once they hit their fifties often find that talent platforms offer them a way to continue to use their skills and experience—while maintaining satisfying work/life balance. Given that by 2030 one in five Americans will be older than 65, talent platforms expect that experienced workers with hard-to-find skills will flock to their fold. Millennials, who are already the largest generational cohort in the workforce, tend to be tech-savvy and to prefer to work for themselves rather than for traditional organizations. They want more autonomy and control over their job security than previous generations had. In studying how talent platforms are being used, we’ve identified three areas where companies have consistently found platforms most useful: When the head of technology at the PGA, Kevin Scott, found himself frustrated by the need to constantly improve and upgrade the organization’s digital capabilities and offerings despite a lack of in-house digital talent, he partnered with Upwork to quickly engage software engineers to generate and develop promising ideas. Using Upwork, the PGA was able to get projects started and finished considerably faster than before. Many managers have turned to talent platforms to fast-track processes, meet deliverables, and ensure outcomes. When Anheuser-Busch InBev wanted to quickly expand into new, disruptive products, it realized that despite having a workforce of 150,000, it needed outside help. By tapping into Catalant, the company was able to rapidly get consumer data analyzed and find experts to help roll out products like kombucha tea and spiked seltzer. Similarly, when Matt Collier, a senior director at Prudential PLC, was on a tight deadline to overhaul the training given to insurance agents in Singapore, he turned to Toptal to find designers and other talent that could help him create course materials quickly—and ended up getting the job done for less than it would have cost with traditional vendors. Digital talent platforms can also help companies reinvent the way they deliver value. In 2015, when Enel made the strategic choice to embrace the United Nations’ 2030 sustainable development goals and build new businesses around them, it engaged the services of several crowdsourcing platforms, among them InnoCentive, which alone gave Enel access to more than 400,000 of its highly skilled problem-solvers worldwide. In our survey, C-suite executives in particular seemed to envision a future reliance on talent platforms: Half thought it “highly possible” that their core workforce (permanent full-time employees) would be much smaller in the years to come, and two-thirds told us they expected to increasingly “rent,” “borrow,” or “share” talent to meet specialized needs. Why, then, have so few companies designed strategic approaches to working with talent platforms? Because the structures and processes that most organizations have in place have been designed expressly to protect them from external vendors, much as white blood cells protect our bodies from pathogens. If companies want to work successfully with digital platforms, they need new structures and processes that function as immunosuppressants. That’s a major change, and many vice presidents and directors are worried about the practical implications of embracing it. Integrating an on-demand workforce into a firm’s strategic core, they recognize, means questioning and redesigning every aspect of the organization. For managers already in the throes of a digital transformation, the prospect of taking on another massive project is hardly appealing. To get the most out of talent platforms, companies need to break work down into rigorously defined components that can be easily handed over to outsiders. Managers can’t be vague. But a digital transformation requires a talent transformation. The two go hand in hand. Company leaders understand this. Nearly two-thirds of our survey respondents reported that “understanding the digital skills needed for the future” had been a top priority for them in the previous three years. The very nature of work changes with more technology and automation, as does a company’s ability to find the skills needed to do that work. Online talent platforms provide a way to develop that ability rapidly and with much less effort. To engage with the on-demand workforce at a strategic level, companies will need to focus on five main challenges: When a company decides to turn core functions over to freelance workers, permanent employees often feel threatened. They struggle with sharing information, raise doubts about the values and work habits of outsiders, and assume the worst. That’s what happened when NASA began using crowdsourcing platforms to generate innovative ideas: The organization’s engineers began to worry about their job security and question their professional identities. As one employee put it, his colleagues were not used to saying, “Hey, we have a problem and we don’t know how to solve it. Can you help?” Often, the strongest opposition comes from employees who have the least exposure to high-skills talent platforms. The members of Enel’s leadership team saw this when they decided to seek external innovation help. Pushback came not just from the rank and file but also from senior leaders who were nervous about the message this approach would send. Was turning to freelancers a sign of weakness? Did it signal that the leadership team lacked confidence in the permanent staff? But with some careful attention to cultural change, the company managed to overcome that resistance. Instead of allowing employees to fear the unknown, Enel focused on educating employees about how they could benefit from an on-demand workforce. According to Ernesto Ciorra, the company’s chief “innovability” officer, the first step was to help all full-timers understand that they could use talent platforms to tap a powerful new source of strength. (“Innovability” is Enel’s term for innovation plus sustainability.) “We had to become humbler,” Ciorra told us, noting how important it was to recognize that at times “the best ideas lay outside the company.” Companies need to get employees to see how they personally can benefit from talent platforms. That’s what one private equity firm did when it rolled out plans to collaborate with Upwork. According to Hayden Brown, Upwork’s CEO, the message the firm sent its employees was “This is a way to help you. There are a lot of things that you may be doing in your day-to-day work that you can offload so that you can do even higher-order work or free yourself up to do more strategic thinking.” Paul Wearing However, as more teams include full-time and gig employees, working norms will have to change. Full-time employees will often need to step into coach and “connector” roles—asking questions of outside colleagues, identifying discrete pieces of work for external partners, and making it possible for gig workers to tap institutional knowledge. Full-time and gig employees will also have to learn how to work productively across dispersed, often remote teams. They’ll have to become adept at collaborating with a revolving set of teammates, articulating previously tacit team norms, and making progress easy for everybody to track. Companies will have to base promotion incentives for managers on outcomes attained rather than full-time employees overseen. Some talent platforms have already created tools—available through their enterprise agreements—that can help companies with these sorts of transitions. One of the biggest predictors of whether a company will get the most out of a talent-platform partnership is how well it can break work down into rigorously defined components that can be easily handed over to outsiders. Most companies haven’t focused on this, because in traditional workplaces, managers can afford to be vague when making assignments. They know that everybody on the project team will be interacting so frequently that they’ll be able to clarify goals and make course corrections over time. But when companies use talent platforms, they have to provide much more up-front definition. Enel learned this lesson quickly when it adopted its open-innovation approach. As Ciorra told us, “You can’t just say, ‘I need something useful for my renewable-energy problem.’ Instead, you have to be specific: ‘I need to reduce the usage of X when I do Y in Z context.’” Only after employees started providing this kind of clarity in crowdsourcing appeals did the company begin getting the help it needed. To engage strategically with talent platforms, companies need to develop a portfolio approach to skills. The first step is to understand which capabilities they have in-house, of course. Unilever uses the services of a company called Degreed, which allows employees to develop and certify their expertise in specific areas with so-called microcredentials. The employees get recognition for their know-how and understand exactly which skills they need to acquire to advance; the company benefits because it can now identify which skills the organization already has and who possesses them. Once the company has mapped internal capabilities, it can prepare for step two: striking the right balance when dividing work up internally and externally. That’s something Royal Dutch Shell tackled after identifying an urgent need to generate new revenue through digital and services growth. Using a cloud-based platform called Opportunity Hub that it already had in place, Shell was quickly able to assess the areas where it had the talent to speed toward its strategic goals and where it lacked the right skills. Soon it realized that it had shortfalls in key areas such as digitization and the internet of things—and that it didn’t have the time to find and hire the right people. To get working immediately on projects in these areas, Shell partnered with Catalant. This can be surprisingly difficult, as Collier discovered when he tried to bring in Toptal to help Prudential revamp thousands of training slides. A new mindset and a different way of working were necessary. “To adapt our initial contract for freelancers,” Collier told us, “we had to navigate a number of necessary processes, including due diligence, intellectual property, technology risk, antibribery, even anti-money-laundering.” To get the talent he urgently needed, Collier positioned working with Toptal as an experiment and persuaded stakeholders to give it a try. That paid off. Today, Prudential has a standard service agreement with the platform, and Collier readily leverages it for design and other types of skilled work. A major challenge for companies that want to harness the on-demand workforce is that they’re still subject to regulations and practices that evolved in the predigital era. At Unilever, for example, one struggle was figuring out how to pay freelancers from digital platforms. According to Adfer Muzaffar, a former Unilever senior manager for talent and learning, “Freelancers are accustomed to immediate payment on the platforms via a credit card. But we had longer payment terms, and credit card payment was not an option. We wanted to be able to track who we paid, what we were paying for, what was the quality of work, whether the rates offered were competitive compared to our local costs. So we had to find solutions so that our internal mechanisms and processes could support this new way of working.” Talent transformations are often easier than they might seem. That’s because many companies have people on staff who already have a wealth of experience with talent platforms—the managers who have used them on an ad hoc basis. These people can provide valuable guidance. Ultimately, however, to bring about change on the scale needed to innovate new business models, companies will have to appoint a leader to explore how online workforce platforms can unlock new sources of value. This has to be somebody from the C-suite. It might be the CTO, the CMO, the CFO, or the CHRO—we’ve seen successful examples of each. In the end, of course, it’s not titles that matter. It’s finding leaders who understand their companies’ strategic positioning, who recognize the revolutionary potential of engaging with the on-demand workforce, and who can inspire a cultural shift in their organizations that will make a genuine transformation possible."

Each offers a unique opportunity to reduce underlying bias and create a technology that is honest and fair to all. Leaders must make it a priority to take a closer look at the models and techniques for addressing bias in each of these stages to identify how best to implement the models across their technology. Ultimately, there is no way to completely eliminate AI bias, but it’s the industry’s responsibility to collaborate and help mitigate its presence in future technology. With AI playing an increasing important role in our lives, and with so much promise for future innovation, it is necessary that we acknowledge and address prejudice in our technology, as well as in our society. AI has long been enabling innovation, with both big and small impacts. From AI-generated music, to enhancing the remote fan experience at the U.S. Open, to managing coronavirus patients in hospitals, it seems like the future is limitless. But, in the last few months, organizations from all sectors have been met with the realities of both Covid-19 and increasing anxiety over social justice issues, which has led to a reckoning within companies about the areas where more innovation and better processes are required. In the AI industry, specifically, organizations need to embrace their role in ensuring a fairer and less-biased world. It’s been well-established that machine learning models and AI systems can be inherently biased, some more than others — a result most commonly attributed to the data being used to train and develop them. In fact, researchers have been working on ways to address and mitigate bias for years. And as the industry looks forward, it’s vital to shine a light on the various approaches and techniques that will help create more just and accurate models. Bias mitigation is a fairly technical process, where certain techniques can be deployed depending on the stage in the machine learning pipeline: pre-processing  (preparing the data before building and training models), in-processing (modifications to algorithms during the training phase), and post-processing (applying techniques after training data has been processed). Each offers a unique opportunity to reduce underlying bias and create a technology that is honest and fair to all. Leaders must make it a priority to take a closer look at the models and techniques for addressing bias in each of these stages to identify how best to implement the models across their technology. First, we need to address the training data. This data is used to develop machine learning models, and is often where the underlying bias seeps in. Bias can be introduced by the selection or sampling of the training data itself. This may involve unintentionally excluding certain groups, so that when the resulting model gets applied to these groups, the accuracy is inevitably lower than it is for the groups that were included in the training data. Additionally, training data usually requires labels used to “teach” the machine learning model during training. These labels often come from humans, which of course risks the introduction of bias. For label data in particular, it is crucial to ensure that there is a diversity of demographics in the human labelers to ensure that unconscious biases don’t creep in. Counterfactual fairness is one technique scientists use to ensure that outcomes are the same in both the actual world and in a “counterfactual world,” where individuals belong to a completely different demographic. A great example of where this is of value is in university admissions — let’s say William from Los Angeles, who is white, and Barack from Chicago, who is African American, have similar GPAs and test scores. Does the model process the data the same if demographic information is swapped? When predicting outcomes or making decisions, such as who gets the final university acceptance letter of the year, the training data and resulting models should be carefully vetted and tested before being fully implemented. It is especially important to assess variance in performance across sensitive factors like race and gender. When training a machine learning model, in-processing models offer unique opportunities to encourage fairness and use regularization to tackle bias. Adversarial training techniques can be applied to mitigate bias, where the machine learning model is jointly trained to simultaneously minimize errors in the primary objective (e.g., confirming or rejecting university admissions) while also penalizing the ability of another part of the model to predict some sensitive category (e.g., race). My company recently conducted research on de-biasing approaches for examining gender bias in speech emotion recognition. Our research found that fairer, more consistent model accuracy can be achieved by applying a simple de-biasing training technique — here we compared a state-of-the-art approach on adversarial training to an approach with no de-biasing. Without any de-biasing, we found that emotional activation model accuracy is consistently lower for females compared to male audio samples. However, by applying a simple modification to the error term during the model training, we were able to effectively mitigate this bias while maintaining good overall model accuracy. Post-processing is a final safeguard that can be used to protect against bias. One technique, in particular, has gained popularity: Reject Option-Based Classification. This process assumes that discrimination happens when models are least certain of a prediction. The technique exploits the “low confidence region” and rejects those predictions to reduce bias in the end game. This allows you to avoid making potentially problematic predictions. Also, by monitoring the volume of rejected inferences, engineers and scientists can be alerted to changes in the characteristics of the data seen in production and new bias risks. It is imperative that modern machine learning technology is developed in a manner that deliberately mitigates bias. Doing this effectively won’t happen overnight, but raising awareness of the presence of bias, being honest about the issues at hand, and striving for better results will be fundamental to growing the technology. As I wrote a year ago, the causes and solutions of AI bias are not black and white. Even “fairness” itself must be quantified to help mitigate the effects of unwanted bias. As we navigate the lasting effects of the pandemic and social unrest, mitigating AI bias will continue to become more important. Here are several ways to get your own organization to focus on creating fairer AI: Ultimately, there is no way to completely eliminate AI bias, but it’s the industry’s responsibility to collaborate and help mitigate its presence in future technology. With AI playing an increasing important role in our lives, and with so much promise for future innovation, it is necessary that we acknowledge and address prejudice in our technology, as well as in our society.

"141",141,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/ai-engineers-need-to-think-beyond-engineering","technology.txt","It is very, very easy for a well-intentioned AI practitioner to inadvertently do harm when they set out to do good — AI has the power to amplify unfair biases, making innate biases exponentially more harmful. Because AI often interacts with complex social systems, where correlation and causation might not be immediately clear — or even easily discernible — AI practitioners need to build partnerships with community members, stakeholders, and experts to help them better understand the world they’re interacting with and the implications of making mistakes. Community-based system dynamics (CBSD) is a promising participatory approach to understanding complex social systems that does just that. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the biggest drivers of technological change, impacting industries and creating entirely new opportunities. From an engineering standpoint, AI is just a more advanced form of data engineering. Most good AI projects function more like muddy pickup trucks than spotless race cars — they are a workhorse technology that humbly makes a production line 5% safer or movie recommendations a little more on point. However, more so than many other technologies, it is very, very easy for a well-intentioned AI practitioner to inadvertently do harm when they set out to do good. AI has the power to amplify unfair biases, making innate biases exponentially more harmful. As Google AI practitioners, we understand that how AI technology is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come. As such, it’s crucial to formulate best practices. This starts with the responsible development of the technology and mitigating any potential unfair bias which may exist, both of which require technologists to look more than one step ahead: not “Will this delivery automation save 15% on the delivery cost?” but “How will this change affect the cities where we operate and the people — at-risk populations in particular — who live there?” This has to be done the old-fashioned way: by human data scientists understanding the process that generates the variables that end up in datasets and models. What’s more, that understanding can only be achieved in partnership with the people represented by and impacted by these variables — community members and stakeholders, such as experts who understand the complex systems that AI will ultimately interact with. How do we actually implement this goal of building fairness into these new technologies — especially when they often work in ways we might not expect? As a first step, computer scientists need to do more to understand the contexts in which their technologies are being developed and deployed. Despite our advances in measuring and detecting unfair bias, causation mistakes can still lead to harmful outcomes for marginalized communities. What’s a causation mistake? Take, for example, the observation during the Middle Ages that sick people attracted fewer lice, which led to an assumption that lice were good for you. In actual fact, lice don’t like living on people with fevers. Causation mistakes like this, where a correlation is wrongly thought to signal a cause and effect, can be extremely harmful in high-stakes domains such as health care and criminal justice. AI system developers — who usually do not have social science backgrounds — typically do not understand the underlying societal systems and structures that generate the problems their systems are intended to solve. This lack of understanding can lead to designs based on oversimplified, incorrect causal assumptions that exclude critical societal factors and can lead to unintended and harmful outcomes. For instance, the researchers who discovered that a medical algorithm widely used in the U.S. health care was racially biased against Black patients identified that the root cause was the mistaken causal assumption, made by the algorithm designers, that people with more complex health needs will have spent more money on health care. This assumption ignores critical factors — such as lack of trust in the health care system and lack of access to affordable health care — that tend to decrease spending on health care by Black patients regardless of the complexity of their health care needs. Researchers make this kind of causation/correlation mistake all the time. But things are worse for a deep learning computer, which searches billions of possible correlations in order to find the most accurate way to predict data, and thus has billions of opportunities to make causal mistakes. Complicating the issue further, it is very hard, even with modern tools, such as Shapely analysis, to understand why such a mistake was made — a human data scientist sitting in a lab with their supercomputer can never deduce from the data itself what the causation mistakes may be. This is why, among scientists, it is never acceptable to claim to have found a causal relationship in nature just by passively looking at data. You must formulate the hypothesis and then conduct an experiment in order to tease out the causation. Addressing these causal mistakes requires taking a step back. Computer scientists need to do more to understand and account for the underlying societal contexts in which these technologies are developed and deployed. Here at Google, we started to lay the foundations for what this approach might look like. In a recent paper co-written by DeepMind, Google AI, and our Trust & Safety team, we argue that considering these societal contexts requires embracing the fact that they are dynamic, complex, non-linear, adaptive systems governed by hard-to-see feedback mechanisms. We all participate in these systems, but no individual person or algorithm can see them in their entirety or fully understand them. So, to account for these inevitable blindspots and innovate responsibly, technologists must collaborate with stakeholders — representatives from sociology, behavioral science, and the humanities, as well as from vulnerable communities — to form a shared hypothesis of how they work. This process should happen at the earliest stages of product development — even before product design starts — and be done in full partnership with communities most vulnerable to algorithmic bias. This participatory approach to understanding complex social systems — called community-based system dynamics (CBSD) — requires building new networks to bring these stakeholders into the process. CBSD is grounded in systems thinking and incorporates rigorous qualitative and quantitative methods for collaboratively describing and understanding complex problem domains, and we’ve identified it as a promising practice in our research. Building the capacity to partner with communities in fair and ethical ways that provide benefits to all participants needs to be a top priority. It won’t be easy. But the societal insights gained from a deep understanding of the problems that matter most to the most vulnerable in society can lead to technological innovations that are safer and more beneficial for everyone. When communities are underrepresented in the product development design process, they are underserved by the products that result. Right now, we’re designing what the future of AI will look like. Will it be inclusive and equitable? Or will it reflect the most unfair and unjust elements of our society? The more just option isn’t a foregone conclusion — we have to work towards it. Our vision for the technology is one where a full range of perspectives, experiences and structural inequities are accounted for. We work to seek out and include these perspectives in a range of ways, including human rights diligence processes, research sprints, direct input from vulnerable communities and organizations focused on inclusion, diversity, and equity such as WiML (Women in ML) and Latinx in AI; many of these organizations are also co-founded and co-led by Googler researchers, such as Black in AI and Queer in AI. If we, as a field, want this technology to live up to our ideals, then we need to change how we think about what we’re building — to shift to our mindset from “building because we can” to “building what we should.” This means fundamentally shifting our focus to understanding deep problems and working to ethically partner and collaborate with marginalized communities. This will give us a more reliable view of both the data that fuels our algorithms and the problems we seek to solve. This deeper understanding could allow organizations in every sector to unlock new possibilities of what they have to offer while being inclusive, equitable and socially beneficial."
"142",142,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/marketers-underuse-ad-experiments-thats-a-big-mistake","technology.txt","Business experimentation is—rightfully—framed as a gold standard by scholars and leading practitioners, but the practice has yet to find its way into most firms’ day-to-day advertising strategy. That’s a big mistake. E-commerce companies that conduct ad experiments see two to three percent better performance per experiment run (as measured by purchases achieved per advertising dollar spent).  In this study, an advertiser that ran 15 experiments (versus none) in a given year sees about a 30% higher ad performance that year; those that ran 15 experiments in the prior year see about a 45% increase in performance. Recently, I gave a talk to 30 senior digital growth managers on how to use business experimentation effectively. I started the session with a brief survey: Who had run experiments with their website and app — for example, testing different layouts, colors, designs, or onboarding experiences? Close to 90% of hands rose in response. Then I asked who had run experiments with their digital advertising, such as evaluating different audience targeting, frequency, or optimization regimes for their campaigns? Only about a third of those same hands went up. This result did not surprise me; rather, it confirmed what I had seen during a year-long investigation of firm behavior on Facebook’s advertising platform: While business experimentation is — rightfully — framed as a gold standard by scholars and leading practitioners, the practice has yet to find its way into most firms’ day-to-day advertising strategy. Many firms are used to non-experimental approaches to advertising measurement, such as marketing mix models, and hesitate to adopt experimentation-based measurement in part because they overestimate its complexity. Most digital advertising platforms offer “experimentation-as-a-service” tools and, while some of the testing parameters are indeed more advanced than what  has long been commonly available in advertising, a digital team can help sort through optimization strategies, frequency regimes, or audience targeting strategies. Many firms simply start off by testing their current digital approach against a control population called a “holdout group” which receives no messaging; this allows them to gauge how their existing ads work relative to no advertising. More sophisticated experimentation can then follow. To quantify companies’ use of experiments, my colleagues and I at Facebook Marketing Science Research conducted an observational survey of leading firms’ use of randomized control trials (RCTs) to gauge the impact of a given ad campaign on various business outcomes relative to a control. Though we suspected that only a minority of firms used the practice, we were surprised by just how few: Only 12.6% of the 6,777 companies we looked at had conducted a recent RCT (see our academic paper here). As you might expect, companies’ use of experimentation varies by industry. Factors such as the pace of consumer consideration and purchase cycles or (as will be discussed) the presence of organizational-culture barriers can influence adoption. At the top of the scale, somewhat more than 20% of e-commerce, telecommunications, and retail advertisers conducted experiments; however, only 6.7% of consumer package goods companies and 4.2% of automotive businesses did so. Firms that do experiment tend to run more than one experiment in a year, averaging 15 experiments per firm in e-commerce and close to 50 in the travel sector, and typically invest about 10% of their overall advertising budget in experimentally measured campaigns. This investment seems to pay off: E-commerce companies that conduct ad experiments see two to three percent better performance per experiment run (as measured by purchases achieved per advertising dollar spent).  In our sample, an advertiser that ran 15 experiments (versus none) in a given year sees about a 30% higher ad performance that year; those that ran 15 experiments in the prior year see about a 45% increase in performance, highlighting the positive longer-term impact of this strategy. Given the powerful impact of ad experiments, why are they so underused? Through conversations with internal and external domain experts and scholars, I’ve identified several common organizational obstacles that may account for this. Organizational inertia: The “Mad Men” days of advertising are (largely) over, but creativity continues to be an essential ingredient for lasting success in advertising. You may remember Donald Draper’s tantrums when he faced research that challenged his preconceptions. Because marketing creatives can be skeptical about data-analytic approaches, empiricism and data-driven decision making need to be carefully introduced to — and ultimately combined with — creative and intuitive advertising operations. This process takes time. Holdout aversion: Randomized controlled trials require a control group; as noted, in ad experimentation the control is often a holdout group that is not exposed to any advertising. This of course lowers the number of potential customers that the campaign will reach. This does not sit well with many marketers who may feel that the cost associated with excluding potential customer from a campaign outweighs the benefits of experimentation. But as noted, our study shows that advertisers who run experiments experience better performance than those who do not. While we cannot be certain that experimentation caused this outperformance, it is highly unlikely that using holdouts as a control is a net negative. Requirement of inter-company alignment: Managers are used to regularly changing, adapting, and evaluating the firm’s websites and apps, tapping inside talent. Experimentation with advertising, on the other hand, commonly requires collaboration between companies and the use of tools provided by other firms. Additionally, many firms may lack the required culture of collaboration between marketing and other functions needed to execute ad experimentation. Entrenched legacy decision support tools: Marketing mix models are well established and trusted decision-support tools that are seen as less technologically complex and costly than setting up RCTs. But in fact, launching RCTs on digital channels doesn’t require unusually complicated technology, can be done at near zero cost, and can actually help optimize existing marketing mix models. My colleagues and I at Facebook worked with the Boston Consulting Group to understand how leading firms successfully integrate experimentation into advertising operations. While there is no “one size fits all” solution, we identified the following four organizational characteristics among high-performing firms. Executive endorsement: Successful experimentation initiatives need an executive sponsor who can align stakeholders and create the urgency required to change existing behavior and convictions. Advertising experiments can reveal new approaches that may require major marketing budget reallocations across channels. If, for example, an experiment identifies a strategy that would increase ROI five-fold but would require shifting millions of dollars in the budget against some executives’ will,  an “intervention from the entire C-suite, with the CEO as the ultimate advocate,” may be needed “to break down broader business silos,” according to BCG’s recent  report “Marketing Measurement Done Right.” Culture: Leadership needs to foster a culture where robust empirical evidence can overrule preconceptions and opinions. This culture needs to be set (and lived!) at the top. Installing cross-functional committees and “forced mingling” in cross-departmental workshops can catalyze the required culture shift. The BCG report describes the case of a large automaker: “Management initiated a program of cross-functional conversations involving business units and functional departments. These sessions used multiunit data first to define profitability and then to determine how it would be measured across the company and what success would look like for the manufacturer as a whole.” While such initiatives benefit the firm more widely, they help establish a crucial basis for companies to be able to leverage the insights generated in large-scale advertising experiments. Talent: The talent required to produce and understand complex data and experimental results needs to be acquired and trusted by senior stakeholders. A marketing data science team reporting to an executive function can take on this role. In the words of a digital leader in the telecommunications space quoted in the BCG report: “Our priority became hiring the best talent for our digital team…With the right people in place, we achieved 40% year-over-year sales growth with the same marketing spend.” Persistence: Experimentation is a continuous iterative process that is never completed and that shapes other internal processes. To reap its full benefits, firms need to view it not as a tactical task but a strategic pillar of decision making and ideation. Rallying the troops behind it may take a long time. As the vice president of marketing for an automotive OEM that BCG surveyed reports: “It takes a year of everyone questioning a new model until we have enough history to believe in it.” A heuristic approach to get advertising experimentation off the ground can be to hire a dedicated digital marketing team and earmark a portion of the advertising budget for experimentation; as noted, 10% is typical among companies with a successful experimentation program. Then, in collaboration with other company functions such as finance, marketing leadership can identify a key performance indicator that advertising is to drive. Examples are return on marketing investment or a composite of brand and direct response metrics. The marketing team can then develop new advertising approaches to influence the defined metric. The right culture can catalyze the team to rigorously adopt better-performing advertising approaches and abandon poorly performing ones — ultimately ensuring that existing and potential customers see better and more relevant ads."

These are human augmentation, sensory AI, and geographic AI. Variously described as biohacking or Human 2.0, human augmentation technologies have the potential to enhance human performance for good or ill. Some of the most promising developments aim to improve the lives of people with disabilities. AI-powered exoskeletons can enable disabled individuals or older workers to accomplish physical tasks that were previously impossible. Chinese startup CloudMinds has developed a smart helmet called Meta, which uses a combination of smart sensors, visual recognition, and AI to help visually-impaired people safely navigate urban environments. Using technology similar to autonomous driving, sensors beam data on location and obstacles to a central cloud system, analyze it, and then relay vocal directions and other information back to the user. The system could be used to read road signs and notices, or potentially even translate Braille notices printed in foreign languages. For sign-language users, a major challenge is how to communicate with the majority of people who do not know sign language. A promising development here is the sign-language glove developed by researchers at Cornell University. Users wear a right-hand glove stitched with sensors that measure the orientation of the hand and flex of the fingers during signing. These electrical signals are then encoded as data and analyzed by an algorithm that learns to read the user’s signing patterns and convert these to spoken words. In trials, the system achieved 98% accuracy in translation. Scientists have already shown how brain implants can help paralyzed individuals operate robotic arms and exoskeleton suits. Elon Musk’s NeuraLink aims to go one step further, implanting flexible hair-thin threads to connect the human brain to AI systems that can operate phones and computers. The MIT Media Lab is pioneering a voiceless communications technology — dubbed Alter Ego — that allows users to communicate with computers and AI systems without opening their mouths, offering hope to millions of people afflicted by speech disorders. Transcranial stimulation — an experimental technology still in its infancy — is being used by sports teams and students to build muscle memory and greater concentrative power. Despite these tremendous breakthroughs, the potential for new biases and inequalities remains. Apart from the obvious concerns about privacy associated with invasive technologies, cognitive or physical data could be misused — for example in recruiting or promotion decisions, in the administration of justice, or in granting (or denying) access to public services. Moreover, access to basic digital technology remains a significant barrier, with almost half the world’s population still excluded from the internet. The sociologist Christoph Lutz observes that traditionally disadvantaged citizens are similarly disadvantaged on the internet, for example by having limited access to technology, restricted use opportunities, and by lacking important digital skills. In fact, many fear that the affluent will be better able to afford costly performance-enhancing technology, perpetuating existing disparities in education and the job market. Educational performance may come to depend less and less on how hard you study in college, and more and more on what kind of technology you can afford. Yuval Harari, the author of Homo Deus, has argued that AI technologies could eventually splinter humanity into two classes he labels “the Gods and the Useless” — those who can avail themselves of performance-augmenting AI and those who cannot. The human senses — sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste — represent a rich territory for the next generation of AI technologies and applications. Take our voices, for example. The pitch, tone, timbre, and vocabulary used can provide important clues to our physical and mental well-being. The journal Nature recently reported how voice analysis algorithms are being developed to spot signs of depression (where the frequency and amplitude of speech decline) and Alzheimer’s Disease (where sufferers use more pronouns than nouns as they forget common terms). Advances in digital olfaction — the use of digital technologies that mimic the sense of smell — may soon be used to detect cancer and other diseases before the symptoms become apparent. Given increasing concern around access to healthcare in the U.S. and other economies, these developments offer the potential for early, low-cost detection of major chronic diseases: imagine just talking into your iPhone for a daily check-up. Yet, the potential for bias is also there: users’ data could be screened without their knowledge and could ultimately be used to cherry-pick lower-risk or healthier individuals for jobs, healthcare coverage, and life insurance, for example. The European Commission has warned that AI may perpetuate historical imbalances or inequality in society, particularly where there are data gaps along gender, racial, or ethnic lines. In healthcare, for example, disease symptoms often vary between males and females, creating the risk of bias or misdiagnosis in AI-based systems of disease detection and monitoring that are trained on gendered datasets. For example, while AI systems have been shown to be as accurate as dermatologists in detecting melanomas, these datasets are often not representative of the population at large with different skin types. The lack of representation of racial minorities in AI training data has been investigated by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru, who found that several major facial recognition datasets were “overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects,” with significantly lower accuracy rates for females and darker-skinned subjects. Imagine being able to look at images of a city and identify patterns of inequality and urban deprivation. This vision is now a step closer thanks to a team of scientists from Imperial College London, who developed an algorithm that uses Google Street View images of cities to identify patterns of inequality in incomes, quality of life, and health outcomes. I interviewed Dr. Esra Suel, an expert in transport planning who led the pilot project, who observed: “We wanted to understand how real people experience cities — their homes, neighborhoods, green spaces, environment, and access to urban services such as shops, schools, and sanitation. Yet, existing measures do not capture the complexity of their experiences in their entirety.” Dr. Suel see three major benefits as visual AI systems evolve in the future. “First, they can complement official statistics such as the census in providing timelier measures of inequality, so that governments can direct resources to areas based on changing needs. Second, they can uncover pockets of poverty that may be concealed by high average incomes — the poor neighborhood located side-by-side with a more plush city area, for example. Third, the use of visual AI could be a game changer for developing countries, which often lack the resources to collect official data on inequality.” The element of speed becomes even more critical in tracking and controlling infectious diseases, which are a major source of health and educational inequality in the developing world. Canadian startup BlueDot used airport flight data and population grids to model the spread of the Zika virus from its origin in Brazil. More recently, BlueDot sounded an early alarm around the spread of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan, using a combination of news reports, animal disease tracking, and airline ticketing data. Yet this increased ability to digitally map and analyze our environs carries risks. One concern is that geographic AI systems could lead to a new era of “digital redlining” — a reprise of the practice of government-backed mortgage providers denying loans to residents of minority neighborhoods regardless of their creditworthiness, which emerged in the U.S. in the 1930s, on the justification that those loans were “high risk.” Digital red-lining could lead businesses to eschew lower-income areas, for example by denying access to insurance coverage or imposing higher premiums. Even worse, geographic algorithms could make it easier for unscrupulous operators to target areas and households with high degrees of a dependency, for example to gambling or alcohol, and to target them with predatory loans. Moreover, the predominant use of such systems in poorer areas could itself be deemed unfair or discriminatory, to the extent that they target particular areas or socio-economic groups. To take one example, more and more governments are using AI systems in their welfare and criminal justice systems. In the Netherlands, a court recently ordered the government to stop using an AI-based welfare surveillance system to screen applications for fraud on the grounds that it violated human rights and was being used predominantly in poorer immigrant neighborhoods. How can these frontier AI technologies be harnessed as a force for greater equality while minimizing the potential for misuse and bias? While inequality is a complex problem with many dimensions, three actions can set policymakers and business leaders moving in the right direction. Get the basics right. The simple truth is that much of the world’s population, especially in poorer countries, stands to lose out from the benefits of AI for one reason: lack of access to basic digital infrastructure. And here the statistics make sobering reading: less than half the population in developing countries has access to the internet, a figure that falls to 19% for the very poorest countries. There is a growing gender imbalance in internet usage, with 58% of men globally using the internet compared to 48% of women. A first priority must be to accelerate the roll-out of broadband infrastructure, particularly in the developing world, which could benefit from low-cost AI applications in healthcare and education. Public-private partnerships, the use of low-cost sensor technology, and innovative pricing models can also help to increase access. Spread the benefits. To guard against the use of AI for cherry-picking profitable customers, or conversely, digital redlining, regulators can borrow from some of the tools of trade policy and utility regulation. One option would be a kind of “most-favored customer” rule, where operators would need to offer similarly advantageous terms to all within a defined group or area. Such requirements would provide reassurance to customers that they are not being treated inequitably. Another option, from utilities regulation, would be some kind of universal service fund where businesses collectively fund services in poorer areas in return for the right to provide profitable services elsewhere. Businesses can also look to new forms of social enterprise, working collaboratively with governments and private investors to provide low-cost services to groups at particular risk. Select for unbiasedness. Most real-world datasets are not statistically representative by definition — they represent the outcome of various societal and institutional biases. A healthcare database, for example, reflects a series of filters around which people get the disease, who gets treated, and whose data gets recorded in the database. So we need to correct for built-in biases at every turn. In using AI-based systems, a first step for businesses, governments, and regulators must be to carefully scrutinize the process by which their training datasets are created. Greater openness around the broad structure and parameters of datasets can help organizations spot gaps and biases, as well as provide extra reassurance around the integrity of such data. Will AI prove to be the great leveler or a new divider? The answer lies in our own hands. By taking action now to address biases and risks, businesses and governments can start to make AI a true force for social progress and economic prosperity."

After all, if none of the researchers building facial recognition systems are people of color, ensuring that non-white faces are properly distinguished may be a far lower priority. The problem is that human resume screening is itself inherently biased. Discrimination is so prevalent that minorities often actively whiten resumes (and are subsequently more successful in the job market). Scanning resumes, whether by computer or human, is an archaic practice best relegated to the dustbin of history. At best, it measures a candidate’s ability to tactfully boast about their accomplishments and, at worse, provides all the right ingredients for either intentional or unintentional discrimination. One way that companies can overcome this challenge is to embrace more objective interviewing techniques, such as project-based assessments, which ask candidates to demonstrate their own abilities, rather than just claim them. Companies still focusing on resume screenings while foregoing more objective assessments need to understand the negative repercussions on workplace diversity — and that it may be perpetuating, not diminishing, the bias in their AI and analytics. We’ve seen no shortage of scandals when it comes to AI. In 2016, Microsoft Tay, an AI bot built to learn in real time from social media content turned into a misogynist, racist troll within 24 hours of launch. A ProPublica report claimed that an algorithm — built by a private contractor — was more likely to rate black parole candidates as higher risk. A landmark U.S. government study reported that more than 200 facial recognition algorithms — comprising a majority in the industry — had a harder time distinguishing non-white faces. The bias in our human-built AI likely owes something to the lack of diversity in the humans who built them. After all, if none of the researchers building facial recognition systems are people of color, ensuring that non-white faces are properly distinguished may be a far lower priority. Technology has a remarkably non-diverse workforce. A 2019 study found that under 5.7% of Google employees were Latinx, and 3.3% were Black. Similarly low rates exist across the tech industry. And those numbers are hardly better outside the tech industry, with Latinx and Black employees making up just 7% and 9%, respectively, of STEM workers in the general economy. (They comprise 18.5% and 13.4%, respectively, of the U.S. population.) Data science is a special standout — by one estimate, it underrepresents women, Hispanics, and Blacks more than any other role in the tech industry. It may come as no surprise that a 2019 study by the non-profit Female Founders Faster Forward (F4) found that 95% of surveyed candidates reported facing discrimination in the workplace. With such a biased workforce, how can we expect our AI to fare any better? Sources of bias in hiring abound. Some of this comes from AI. Amazon famously had to scrap its AI recruiting bot when the company discovered it was biased against women. And it’s not just tech titans: LinkedIn’s 2018 Global Recruiting Trends survey found that 64% of employers use AI and data in recruiting, including top employers like Target, Hilton, Cisco, PepsiCo, and Ikea. But we cannot entirely blame AI —­ there is a much deeper and more systemic source of hiring bias. An established field of academic research suggests that human resume screening is inherently biased. Using innovative field experiments, university researchers have shown that resume screeners discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, and age. Discrimination is so prevalent that minorities often actively whiten resumes (and are subsequently more successful in the job market). Scanning resumes, whether by computer or human, is an archaic practice best relegated to the dustbin of history. At best, it measures a candidate’s ability to tactfully boast about their accomplishments and, at worse, provides all the right ingredients for either intentional or unintentional discrimination. So how are companies overcoming this challenge? An unlikely parallel exists in — of all places — the field of classical music. In the 1970s and 1980s, historically male-dominated orchestras began changing their procedures for hiring. Auditions were conducted blind — placing a screen between the candidate and their judging committee so that the identity of the auditioner could not be discerned — only their music was being judged. The effects of this change were astounding: Harvard researchers found that women were passing 1.6 times more in blind auditions than in non-blind ones, and the number of female players in the orchestras increased by 20 to 30 percentage points. By focusing on the candidate’s performance (rather than irrelevant discriminatory attributes) companies can increase both diversity and quality of their new hires. Here’s how. Like symphony orchestras, smart companies are starting to embrace more objective interviewing techniques. Chief among these are project-based assessments. While the exact parameters vary, project-based assessments in AI and data science typically ask a candidate to clean and analyze some real-world data and write a short report of their findings. Some are more directed assessments, while others are more open-ended. Some are take-home, while others are administered during an interview onsite. Regardless of their style, they ask candidates to demonstrate their own abilities, rather than just claim them. Project-based assessments have a number of benefits. First, they provide a lot more information about a candidate than any resume possibly could. In a recent interview, Hugo Bowne-Anderson, Head of Data Science Evangelism and Marketing at data science company Coiled, told me that “having a process that mimics workplace data science communications adds a whole new level to the assessment that gives loads of signals to the interviewers.” Second, the substance of these assessments is more realistic than what can be gleaned from resume scanning. Project-based assessments provide “an on-the-job sneak-peak at a candidate’s work and abilities,” according to Jesse Anderson, an industry veteran and author of “Data Teams.” He’s not alone. In a recent interview, Sean Gerrish, an engineering manager and author of “How Smart Machines Think” noted that “take-home challenges give employers a chance to simulate how the candidate will perform on the job more realistically than with puzzle interview questions.” Finally, AI and data science are not just about number crunching — a lot of it comes down to putting data science into a business context. One of the hardest questions comes from figuring out what question to ask of the data that is both business-relevant and rigorously addressable by science. Another major under-appreciated challenge is communicating those results to a business manager. As Bowne-Anderson puts it, these assessments have candidates “actually answering a business question or framing a data science answer in a way that it’s useful for a decision-maker.” These subtle qualities come across in a project-based assessment but are difficult to deduce from resume screening. To combat bias in AI, companies need more diverse AI talent. Sophisticated, innovative companies are increasingly abandoning prejudicially-fraught resume screening for project-based assessment. At The Data Incubator (where we run a data science fellowship responsible for producing hundreds of Ph.D. data scientists each year), we found that over 60% of firms now provide take-home data assessments for their candidates. Another roughly 20% require onsite interview data projects, where candidates analyze datasets as a part of the interview process. Of the remaining employers, most are the larger, more established enterprises that are usually slower to adapt to change. Companies still focusing on resume screenings and foregoing more objective assessments need to understand the negative repercussions on workplace diversity — and that it may be perpetuating, not diminishing, the bias in their AI and analytics."

To fight Covid-19, the United States must be open to ideas from everywhere, including developing countries. Sometimes less-wealthy countries can offer simple, low-tech solutions that are highly effective at containing infectious diseases. In an earlier article, I discussed how U.S. health care organizations are borrowing lessons from Asia and Africa to fight Covid-19. Looking further, a team at Northeastern University’s Center for Emerging Markets spent two months scouring the internet for other ideas that less-wealthy countries have used to address the pandemic in areas including prevention, testing, isolation, quarantining, treatment, and reopening. We’ve organized more than 50 ideas across these categories on a website maintained by Jorja Kahn: Reverse Innovation to Fight Covid-19.  We invite health care leaders and policy makers to adapt these ideas and contribute to them. Global crowdsourcing could help all countries fight the pandemic more effectively. Here are three takeaways from our explorations. 1. The United States needs a comprehensive strategy. Places including Hong Kong, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam rapidly developed nationally coordinated strategies for fighting Covid-19. Their goal, almost from the outset, was to crush the pandemic, not merely “flatten the curve” to a medically manageable level. Many of these countries created high-level command centers to develop and implement their strategies. They’ve used everything in the toolbox — not just lockdowns and treatments. They moved quickly, sometimes preemptively, knowing that delays could be costly when an infection can spread exponentially. For the same reason, they didn’t wait for flare-ups to reach serious levels before responding. Poor countries such as Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Vietnam that have a paucity of medical staff and facilities were especially under pressure to nip the infection in the bud. By comparison, the initial U.S. response was slow and disjointed. With experience, several U.S. states are developing more-comprehensive strategies, but more can be done, particularly at the federal level. For examples of poorer countries’ effective national strategies, look at the cases of Vietnam, Rwanda, and Taiwan 2. Simple solutions can make a difference. Many ideas that other countries have used to fight Covid-19 are simple and low-tech, but they have worked. The classic example is masks, which studies have shown are an inexpensive way to slow the spread of infection and allow economies to reopen. Several countries have created public campaigns that encourage mask wearing, social distancing, and handwashing. Their national leaders often set an example and made the pitch themselves, in televised and online addresses. A Taiwanese team instructed citizens on the proper way to make, wear, and dispose of masks. A catchy infection-prevention video collaboration between musicians and Vietnam’s health ministry went viral in the country. In China and elsewhere, temperatures are checked regularly in public places. Singapore’s government has hired laid-off airline employees as “ambassadors” to disseminate information on Covid-19 and encourage safe practices. Countries have sometimes augmented these simple practices with additional technologies. Some have used drones and robots to monitor public places and blare messages if people were getting too close to one another, or to disinfect offices and malls. Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan complement human contact tracing with digital contact tracing. Hong Kong and Taiwan are using “electronic fencing” to ensure compliance with quarantining and isolation requirements. Some countries have produced Covid-19 maps locating hotspots and dashboards showing how many ICU beds and ventilators are available in various hospitals. China initially used artificial intelligence to support nonintrusive thermal scanning of crowds in public venues, but with the number of new cases now down in the teens, it continues to do so primarily at international airports and border control points. These countries have also used vintage practices that have atrophied from disuse in the United States. A case in point is pooled testing: combining samples from several people into a single test and then testing those people individually only if the pooled result is positive. The United States once used the technique to monitor syphilis, and it is still widely used in poor countries, where tests are in short supply and cost is paramount. Manoj Jain, a Memphis-based  infectious disease physician and epidemiologist, learned about pooled testing used for tuberculosis screening in India (Jain was a World Health Organization consultant) and wondered why the United States wasn’t doing the same for Covid-19. “Having seen it work well in India gave me the confidence to push for it in the United States,” he says. Working with his city’s mayor, Jain helped Memphis become one of the first cities to get FDA approval for pooled testing in private labs. As Covid-19 persists and millions need to be tested in schools and workplaces, pooled testing is getting a second look in the United States. “The FDA should mandate it nationally,” Jain says. Home isolation of Covid-19 patients is another practice that countries including India have used effectively. In China and Vietnam, anyone testing positive is isolated in an institutional facility, away from family. Delhi has shown that home-based isolation of mild or even moderate cases, with proper medical screening and supervision, can be safe and cheap and can reduce the strain on hospitals. It is strongly preferred by citizens, who fear being whisked away from their families by the authorities. Delhi’s approach, supported by instructional videos, public health protocols, and an all-in-one telemedicine and contact-tracing app, has become a model for the rest of India. While government-mandated quarantine in an institutional facility would probably meet resistance in most democracies, home-based isolation is now being considered in the United States even for advanced cases, and it may help when hospitals are packed or hard to get to, as in remote rural areas. 3. Learn from global experiments. All countries, including the United States, can learn from the innovative responses to Covid-19 around the globe. (See, for instance, this site on Covid-19-related innovations in Latin America). Recently, convalescent plasma therapy made headlines in the United States, but it had been tried with Ebola patients and has been used by countries including Argentina and India to treat Covid-19 patients. Dr. Nimmi Rastogi, an adviser to the Delhi government, notes that “it doesn’t require fancy equipment and is a cost-effective treatment.” She adds that although it’s not always effective, the risk of serious side effects is low. Developing countries also have some advantages in new product development, such as lower costs, significant talent pools, large patient populations, and fewer regulatory barriers to innovation. In countries including South Africa, local organizations have rushed to produce ultra-low-cost ventilators to meet Covid-19 needs. India’s InnAccel has developed an FDA-approved device to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia that is also safer for caregivers and a helmet-based noninvasive oxygen therapy for which it has sought FDA emergency-use authorization. Similarly, U.S. efforts to develop rapid tests for Covid-19 are being complemented by projects overseas. The Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi has developed a highly reliable paper-based Covid-19 test that can provide results in an hour and costs less than U.S. $7 per use. Paul Davis, who invented the home pregnancy test, is involved with the 120-year old L’Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal in developing a Covid-19 rapid-test that is expected to cost a dollar per test. Vaccine development is another important front for international partnership, because countries can benefit by collaborating in the research, clinical testing, and manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines at a global scale. Chinese vaccines are being tested in Brazil, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. Russian vaccines will be manufactured in China. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be bulk-produced in India — and so on. Yet Russia and the United States are not part of COVAX, the 184-nation alliance that aims to produce and distribute vaccines quickly and equitably, and China joined only this month. Vaccine nationalism, the head of the WHO warns, “will not end the crisis but perpetuate it.” The Promise of Crowdsourcing Given the high stakes, the nations of the world must cooperate to fight Covid-19. The United States must turn outward, not inward, and embrace ideas from everywhere, including developing countries. Our center’s Covid-19 website is a small step in that direction. Looking beyond Covid-19, the same innovation crowdsourcing approach could help improve U.S. health care generally. When faced with a health care problem, U.S. providers tend to go for expensive, high-tech solutions. But crowdsourcing ideas from developing nations could point us toward simple, low-tech, inexpensive solutions that might be just what the doctor ordered.

"146",146,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/a-measured-approach-to-regulating-fast-changing-tech","technology.txt","Innovations driving what many refer to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution are as varied as the enterprises affected. Industries and their supply chains are already being revolutionized by several emerging technologies, including 5G networks, artificial intelligence, and advanced robotics, all of which make possible new products and services that are both better and cheaper than current offerings. Unfortunately, not every application of transformational technology is as obviously beneficial to individuals or society as a whole. But rather than panic, regulators will need to step back, and balance costs and benefits rationally. Amid the economic upheaval caused by Covid-19, technology-driven disruption continues to transform nearly every business at an accelerating pace, from entertainment to shopping to how we work and go to school. Though the crisis may be temporary, many changes in consumer behavior are likely permanent. Well before the pandemic, however, industries and their supply chains were already being revolutionized by several emerging technologies, including 5G networks, artificial intelligence, and advanced robotics, all of which make possible new products and services that are both better and cheaper than current offerings. That kind of “big bang” disruption can quickly and repeatedly rewrite the rules of engagement for incumbents and new entrants alike. But is the world changing too fast? And, if so, are governments capable of regulating the pace and trajectory of disruption? The answers to those questions vary by industry, of course. That’s because the innovations driving what many refer to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution are as varied as the enterprises affected. In my recent book, Pivot to the Future, my co-authors and I identified ten transformative technologies with the greatest potential to generate new value for consumers, which is the only measure of progress that really matters.  They are: extended reality, cloud computing, 3D printing, advanced human-computer interactions, quantum computing, edge and fog computing, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and smart robotics. Some of these disruptors, such as blockchain, robotics, 3D printing and the Internet of things, are already in early commercial use. For others, the potential applications may be even more compelling, though the business cases for reaching them are less obvious. Today, for example, only the least risk-adverse investors are funding development in virtual reality, edge computing, and new user interface technologies that interpret and respond to brainwaves. Complicating both investment and adoption of transformative technologies is the fact that the applications with the biggest potential to change the world will almost certainly be built on unanticipated combinations of several novel and mature innovations. Think of the way ride-sharing services require existing GPS services, mobile networks, and devices, or how video conferencing relies on home broadband networks and high-definition displays. Looking at just a few of the most exciting examples of things to come make clear just how unusual the next generation of disruptive combinations will be, and how widespread their potential impact on business-as-usual: Unfortunately, not every application of transformational technology is as obviously beneficial to individuals or society as a whole. Every one of the emerging technologies we identified (and plenty of those already in mainstream use) come with potential negative side — effects that may, in some cases, outweigh the benefits. Often, these costs are both hard to predict and difficult to measure. As disruption accelerates, so too does anxiety about its unintended consequences, feeding what futurist Alvin Toffler first referred to half a century ago as “Future Shock.” Tech boosters and critics alike are increasingly appealing to governments to intervene, both to promote the most promising innovations and, at the same time, to solve messy social and political conflicts aggravated by the technology revolution. On the plus side, governments continue to support research and development of emerging technologies, serving as trial users of the most novel applications. The White House, for example, recently committed over $1 billion for continued exploration of leading-edge innovation in artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The Federal Communications Commission has just concluded one its most successful auctions yet for mobile radio frequencies, clearing bandwidth once considered useless for commercial use but now seen as central to nationwide 5G deployments. Palantir, a data analytics company that works closely with governments to assess terrorism and other complex risks, has just filed for a public offering that values the start-up at over $40 billion. At the same time, a regulatory backlash against technology continues to gain momentum, with concerns about surveillance, the digital divide, privacy, and disinformation leading lawmakers to consider restricting or even banning some of the most popular applications. And the increasingly strategic importance of continued innovation to global competitiveness and national security has fueled increasingly nasty trade disputes, including some between the U.S., China, and the European Union. Together with on-going antitrust inquiries into the competitive behavior of leading technology providers, these negative reactions underscore what author Adam Thierer sees as the growing prevalence of “techno-panics” — generalized fears about personal autonomy, the fate of democratic government, and perhaps even apocalyptic outcomes from letting some emerging technologies run free. Disruptive innovation is not a panacea, but nor is it a poison. As technology transforms more industries and becomes the dominant driver of the global economy, it is inevitable both that users will grow more ambivalent, and, as a result, that regulators will become more involved. If, as a popular metaphor of the 1990’s had it, the digital economy began as a lawless frontier akin to the American West, it’s no surprise that as settlements grow socially complex and economically powerful, the law will continue to play catch up, likely for better and for worse. But rather than panic, regulators need to step back, and balance costs and benefits rationally. That’s the only way we’ll achieve the exciting promise of today’s transformational technologies, but still avoid the dystopias."
"147",147,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/when-does-predictive-technology-become-unethical","technology.txt","What happens when algorithms can predict sensitive things about you, such as your sexual orientation, whether you’re pregnant, whether you’ll quit your job, and whether you’re likely to die soon? We’re not talking about mishandling, leaking, or stealing data. Rather, this is the generation of new data — the indirect discovery of unvolunteered truths about people. Organizations can predict these powerful insights from existing innocuous data, as if creating them out of thin air. So are we ironically facing a downside when predictive models perform too well? We know there’s a cost when models predict incorrectly, but is there also a cost when they predict correctly? It’s a real challenge to draw the line as to which predictive objectives pursued with machine learning are unethical, let alone which should be legislated against, if any. But, at the very least, it’s important to stay vigilant for when machine learning serves to empower a preexisting unethical practice, and also for when it generates data that must be handled with care. Machine learning can ascertain a lot about you — including some of your most sensitive information. For instance, it can predict your sexual orientation, whether you’re pregnant, whether you’ll quit your job, and whether you’re likely to die soon. Researchers can predict race based on Facebook likes, and officials in China use facial recognition to identify and track the Uighurs, a minority ethnic group. Now, do the machines actually “know” these things about you, or are they only making informed guesses? And, if they’re making an inference about you, just the same as any human you know might do, is there really anything wrong with them being so astute? Let’s look at a few cases: In the U.S., the story of Target predicting who’s pregnant is probably the most famous example of an algorithm making sensitive inferences about people. In 2012, a New York Times story about how companies can leverage their data included an anecdote about a father learning that his teenage daughter was pregnant due to Target sending her coupons for baby items in an apparent act of premonition. Although the story about the teenager may be apocryphal — even if it did happen, it would most likely have been coincidence, not predictive analytics that was responsible for the coupons, according to Target’s process detailed by The New York Times story — there is a real risk to privacy in light of this predictive project. After all, if a company’s marketing department predicts who’s pregnant, they’ve ascertained medically sensitive, unvolunteered data that only healthcare staff are normally trained to appropriately handle and safeguard. Mismanaged access to this kind of information can have huge implications on someone’s life. As one concerned citizen posted online, imagine that a pregnant woman’s “job is shaky, and [her] state disability isn’t set up right yet…to have disclosure could risk the retail cost of a birth (approximately $20,000), disability payments during time off (approximately $10,000 to $50,000), and even her job.” This isn’t a case of mishandling, leaking, or stealing data. Rather, it is the generation of new data — the indirect discovery of unvolunteered truths about people. Organizations can predict these powerful insights from existing innocuous data, as if creating them out of thin air. So are we ironically facing a downside when predictive models perform too well? We know there’s a cost when models predict incorrectly, but is there also a cost when they predict correctly? Even if the model isn’t highly accurate, per se, it may still be confident in its predictions for a certain group of pregnant individuals. Let’s say that 2% of the female customers between age 18 and 40 are pregnant. If the model identifies customers, say, three times more likely than average to be pregnant, only 6% of those identified will actually be pregnant. That’s a lift of three. But if you look at a much smaller, focused group, say the top 0.1% likely to be pregnant, you may have a much higher lift of, say, 46, which would make women in that group 92% likely to be pregnant. In that case, the system would be capable of revealing those women as very likely to be pregnant. The same concept applies when predicting sexual orientation, race, health status, location, and your intentions to leave your job. Even if a model isn’t highly accurate in general, it can still reveal with high confidence — for a limited group — things like sexual orientation, race, or ethnicity. This is because, typically, there is a small portion of the population for whom it is easier to predict. Now, it may only be able to predict confidently for a relatively small group, but even just the top 0.1% of a population of a million would mean 1,000 individuals have been confidently identified. It’s easy to think of reasons why people wouldn’t want someone to know these things. As of 2013, Hewlett-Packard was predictively scoring its more than 300,000 workers with the probability of whether they’d quit their job — HP called this the Flight Risk score, and it was delivered to managers. If you’re planning to leave, your boss would probably be the last person you’d want to find out before it’s official. As another example, facial recognition technologies can serve as a way to track location, decreasing the fundamental freedom to move about without disclosure, since, for example, publicly-positioned security cameras can identify people at specific times and places. I certainly don’t sweepingly condemn face recognition, but know that CEO’s at both Microsoft and Google have come down on it for this reason. In yet another example, a consulting firm was modeling employee loss for an HR department, and noticed that they could actually model employee deaths, since that’s one way you lose an employee. The HR folks responded with, “Don’t show us!” They didn’t want the liability of potentially knowing which employees were at risk of dying soon. Research has shown that predictive models can also discern other personal attributes — such as race and ethnicity — based on, for example, Facebook likes. A concern here is the ways in which marketers may be making use of these sorts of predictions. As Harvard professor of government and technology Latanya Sweeney put it, “At the end of the day, online advertising is about discrimination. You don’t want mothers with newborns getting ads for fishing rods, and you don’t want fishermen getting ads for diapers. The question is when does that discrimination cross the line from targeting customers to negatively impacting an entire group of people?” Indeed, a study by Sweeney showed that Google searches for “black-sounding” names were 25% more likely to show an ad suggesting that the person had an arrest record, even if the advertiser had nobody with that name in their database of arrest records. “If you make a technology that can classify people by an ethnicity, someone will use it to repress that ethnicity,” says Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. Which brings us to China, where the government applies facial recognition to identify and track members of the Uighurs, an ethnic group systematically oppressed by the government. This is the first known case of a government using machine learning to profile by ethnicity. This flagging of individuals by ethnic group is designed specifically to be used as a factor in discriminatory decisions — that is, decisions based at least in part on a protected class. In this case, members of this group, once identified, will be treated or considered differently on the basis of their ethnicity. One Chinese start-up valued at more than $1 billion said its software could recognize “sensitive groups of people.” Its website said, “If originally one Uighur lives in a neighborhood, and within 20 days six Uighurs appear, it immediately sends alarms” to law enforcement. Implementing the differential treatment of an ethic group based on predictive technology takes the risks to a whole new level. Jonathan Frankle, a deep learning researcher at MIT, warns that this potential extends beyond China. “I don’t think it’s overblown to treat this as an existential threat to democracy. Once a country adopts a model in this heavy authoritarian mode, it’s using data to enforce thought and rules in a much more deep-seated fashion… To that extent, this is an urgent crisis we are slowly sleepwalking our way into.” It’s a real challenge to draw the line as to which predictive objectives pursued with machine learning are unethical, let alone which should be legislated against, if any. But, at the very least, it’s important to stay vigilant for when machine learning serves to empower a preexisting unethical practice, and also for when it generates data that must be handled with care. Eric Siegel, Ph.D., is a leading consultant and former Columbia University professor who makes machine learning understandable and captivating. He is the founder of the long-running Predictive Analytics World and the Deep Learning World conference series, and is the instructor of the Coursera specialization Machine Learning for Everyone. He’s a popular speaker who’s been commissioned for more than 100 keynote addresses, and executive editor of The Machine Learning Times.

Instead, they are managed by algorithms. As a result, a global, low-paid, algorithmic workforce is emerging. You will increasingly find a gap between top executives and an outer fringe of transient workers, even within organizations. Whether in retail or financial services, logistics or manufacturing, AI-powered organizations are being run by a small cohort of highly paid employees, supported by sophisticated automation and potentially millions of algorithmically managed, low-paid freelancers at the periphery. Job polarization is only part of the problem. What we should really fear is the algorithmic inequality trap that results from these algorithmic feedback loops. The risks of algorithmic discrimination and bias have received much attention and scrutiny, and rightly so. Yet there is another more insidious side-effect of our increasingly AI-powered society — the systematic inequality created by the changing nature of work itself. We fear a future where robots take our jobs, but what happens when a significant portion of the workforce ends up in algorithmically managed jobs with little future and few possibilities for advancement? One of the classic tropes of self-made success is the leader who comes from humble beginnings, working their way up from the mailroom, the cash register, or the factory floor. And while doing that is considerably tougher than Hollywood might suggest, bottom-up mobility was at least possible in traditional organizations. Charlie Bell, former CEO of McDonalds, started as a crew member flipping burgers. Mary Barra, chairman and CEO of General Motors, started on the assembly line. Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, started in a distribution center. By comparison, how many Uber drivers do you think will ever have the chance to attain a managerial position at the company, let alone run the ride-sharing giant? How many future top Amazon executives will start their careers by delivering packages or stacking shelves? The billionaire founder and CEO of Instacart may have personally delivered the company’s first order, but how many others will follow in his footsteps? Here’s the problem: There’s a “code ceiling” that prevents career advancement — irrespective of gender or race — because, in an AI-powered organization, junior employees and freelancers rarely interact with other human co-workers. Instead, they are managed by algorithms. In this new era of digitally mediated work, there is typically a hierarchical information flow, in which the company decides the information they choose to share with you. Unlike driving a taxi, where there is open radio communication between drivers and the dispatch operator, and among the drivers themselves, when you work for Uber or Lyft, the content of your interactions is the output of an optimization function designed to maximize efficiency and profit. To be managed algorithmically is to be subject to constant monitoring and surveillance. If you are one of the millions of food delivery workers in China working for Meituan or Ele.me, an algorithm determines how long it should take you to drop off an order, reducing your pay if you fail to meet your deadline. Similarly, employees in Amazon distribution centers are also carefully tracked by algorithms; they must work at “Amazon pace” — described as “somewhere between walking and jogging.” When you are a gig economy worker, it is not only your AI bosses that should concern you; your co-workers are often also your competition. For example, Chicago residents who live near Amazon’s distribution points and Whole Foods stores reported the strange appearance of smartphones hanging from trees. The reason? Contract delivery drivers were desperate to trump their rivals for job assignments. They believed that hanging their devices near delivery stations would help them game the work allocation algorithm; a smartphone perched in a tree could be the key to getting a $15 delivery route mere seconds before someone else. Work has been changing over the last few decades. The labor market has grown increasingly polarized, with middle-skill jobs being eroded relative to entry-level, low-skill work, and high-level employment that requires greater skill levels. The Covid-19 crisis has likely accelerated the process. Since 1990, every U.S. recession has been followed by a jobless recovery. This time, as AI, algorithms, and automation reshape the workforce, we may end up with something worse: a K-shaped recovery — where the prospects of those at the top soar, and everyone else sees their fortunes dive. The new digital divide is a widening gap between workers with access to higher education, leadership mentoring, and job experience — and those without. In my recent book, The Algorithmic Leader, I explore one particularly dire scenario: a class-based divide between the masses who work for algorithms, a privileged professional class who have the skills and capabilities to design and train algorithmic systems, and a small, ultra-wealthy aristocracy, who own the algorithmic platforms that run the world. A global, low-paid, algorithmic workforce is already emerging. In Latin America, one of the fastest-growing startups is Rappi, a mix of Uber Eats, Instacart, and TaskRabbit. Customers in cities like Bogotá and Mexico City pay about $1 an order or a flat $7 a month. In return, they can access a vast on-demand network of couriers who deliver food, groceries, and just about anything else you want. Amazon has an informal network of delivery people, called Amazon Flex, ready to drop packages right to your door — and soon even hand them to you in the street, place them in your car trunk, or open the door to your house and store your groceries in your fridge. In his 1930 lecture Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, John Maynard Keynes predicted that by around 2030, the production problem would be solved, and there would be enough of everything for everyone. The catch, however, is that machines would cause technological unemployment. The scenario that Keynes didn’t fully anticipate was our present case of high technological employment, with an accompanying degree of high inequality. The workforce is changing; so too is the workplace. You will increasingly find a gap between top executives and an outer fringe of transient workers, even within organizations. Whether in retail or financial services, logistics or manufacturing, AI-powered organizations are run by a small cohort of highly paid employees, supported by sophisticated automation and potentially millions of algorithmically managed, low-paid freelancers at the periphery. Job polarization is only part of the problem. What we should really fear is the algorithmic inequality trap that results from feedback loops. Once you are a gig economy worker reliant on assignments meted out by your smartphone, not only are there few opportunities for promotion or development, but other algorithms may further compound your situation. Think of it as a digital poorhouse. With their earnings and work assignments held hostage by market fluctuations, the new AI underclass may be penalized by automated systems that determine access to welfare, lending, insurance, or health care, or that set custodial sentences. Nevertheless, it is dangerous to seek quick fixes for a problem that has yet to fully manifest, especially if it means grafting 20th-century worker protections onto 21st-century business models. Already, governments and regulators supported by populist platforms are focused on attacking global digital giants. They seek to prevent them from avoiding tax liabilities and are working to regulate their freelance workforce’s labor conditions, to apply restrictions on their collection of data, and even to tax their robots. Some of these ideas have merit. Others are premature, or worse, just political theater. The longer-term solution to algorithmic inequality will not lie in just taxation and regulation, but rather in our ability to provide an adequate education system for the 21st century. Rebooting education will not be easy. Rather than looking for ways to use AI in teaching, the real question is: How do we teach people to harness machine intelligence in their careers? And how do we teach people to be prepared for a lifetime of constant learning and retraining? Business leaders have a crucial role to play. Not only should they carve out channels of communication, feedback, and advancement for freelancers at the edge of their organizations, they need to get serious about retraining and community engagement. For example, AT&T is retraining half of its workforce, while Cisco, IBM, Caterpillar, McKinsey, and JPMorgan are offering internships to high school students and are working with local schools to upgrade their teaching curriculums. These are all good initiatives, but more will be needed — not just for social cohesion, but also to ensure the diversity and agility of tomorrow’s workforce. We need a better plan for the future. Without one, the algorithmic inequality trap will be a story told not in statistics and wealth ratios, but in distress signals — smartphones hanging from trees, tent cities for the homeless, and human couriers scanning the skies for the delivery drones that spell their impending end."
"149",149,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/when-providing-wait-times-it-pays-to-underpromise-and-overdeliver","technology.txt","Virtual queues, or systems that allow you to hold your place without physically standing in line, have become commonplace in restaurants, call centers, and many other businesses — and how you build those systems can have a major impact on the customer’s experience. In this piece, the author shares key takeaways from over a decade’s worth of research on how companies can optimize their virtual queuing systems. Specifically, she suggests that providing wait time estimates can reduce customers’ average wait time, and that providing pessimistic estimates (i.e., telling customers they will have to wait longer than they actually will) can improve the customer experience. In addition, the research shows that providing more frequent progress updates also improves the customer experience, and that customers who wait for longer than expected will take longer when their turn finally arrives (suggesting that pessimistic estimates can also help businesses to increase throughput). In 1999, Disneyland became a pioneer of the virtual queue. That’s the year the company introduced its FastPass system, which allowed customers to hold their place in line virtually while enjoying attractions elsewhere in the park. Virtual queues have since become common in restaurants, call centers, rideshare platforms, and other businesses — and the Covid-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend. But not all virtual queues are created equal. What can businesses do to optimize the customer experience when implementing a virtual queuing system? Decreasing wait times by increasing capacity is the simplest solution, of course, but that’s often prohibitively expensive. Luckily, it’s possible to reduce wait times without increasing capacity, and to improve the customer experience without actually changing wait times. Over the past decade, I have conducted extensive research on the impact of providing estimated wait times on the customer experience in virtual queues, and I’ve made four findings in that work that represent tactical takeaways for businesses: Our first finding may not be surprising, but it carries significant implications for any business operating a virtual queue. In a study looking at banking call centers, conducted with Gad Allon, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Achal Bassamboo, of Northwestern University, we found that providing wait-time estimates led to lower average wait times for all customers. This is because every time someone decided to give up their spot in line, it shortened the wait time for everyone else. Providing wait-time estimates prompted some customers to abandon the line when wait times were very long, and made them less likely to abandon during non-peak times, thus reducing the average wait time while keeping the total number of customers served constant. Just by providing these estimates, companies can improve the waiting experience for everyone. In addition, for rideshare apps and call centers, where congestion is high during peak hours, this research, along with another study of ours, suggests that it may be beneficial to provide a pessimistic wait-time estimate, because this can weed out less-patient customers who are likely to abandon their spot in line eventually anyway. If capacity limitations mean that you won’t be able to serve all customers, then more-pessimistic estimates upfront will quickly eliminate the customers with less tolerance for waiting, speeding up the queue and improving the experience for everyone. In our call-center study, we examined the impact of providing an initial wait-time estimate not only on wait times but also the customer experience. We analyzed over 100,000 calls, which were divided into three test conditions. In the first group, customers were not provided with an estimated wait time; in the second group, they were provided with an inaccurate estimate, either optimistic or pessimistic; and in the third group, they were provided with an accurate estimate. We used caller abandonment (for example, when callers hang up before reaching their turn) as a proxy for customer experience, inferring that higher levels of boredom and stress led customers to abandon at greater rates. Waits that were shorter than expected, we found, had a small positive impact on the customer experience, but waits than wer longer than expected had a significant negative impact. The penalty for under-delivery, in fact, was up to seven times larger than the reward for over-delivery. This suggests that companies offering virtual queues should generally avoid providing optimistic wait-time estimates. Although an optimistic estimate may reduce upfront abandonment rates, that boost isn’t worth the negative experience customers will have when they end up waiting longer than expected. If the estimate is just slightly pessimistic, it’s unlikely to increase the abandonment rate, and the pleasant surprise when their wait is faster than expected will have a significant positive impact on the overall customer experience. In the call-center study described above, customers were provided with a wait-time estimate upon their arrival but were not given subsequent updates about their remaining wait time. To explore the impact of providing progress updates, I worked with Yiming Zhang and Yong-Pin Zhou, of the University of Washington, to conduct a study that explored how the combination of the initial estimate and updates along the way affected customers’ experience. We collaborated with a major ridesharing platform to analyze data from 1.4 million rides, which were randomly assigned to provide a neutral, optimistic, or pessimistic wait-time estimate with real-time updates. We made sure to control for all factors other than estimated wait time and associated frequency of updates, including the actual time customers waited before being matched with a driver. Because customers who received a more-pessimistic initial estimate would by definition receive more frequent updates (for a given wait length), we found that these customers experienced faster perceived progress and so canceled their rides at a lower rate. As long as the initial estimate is not too pessimistic, the positive impact of more frequent updates offsets the any increase in immediate abandonment that occurs as a result of the longer initial estimate. Just as in the call-center study, this suggests that slightly pessimistic wait-time estimates are better than optimistic ones — although if wait-time estimates are too pessimistic, the net abandonment rate may rise. Based on these insights, we helped the platform redesign their virtual-queue system. This helped them achieve significant improvement in their customer-experience metrics: It reduced by 80% the percentage of customers who had to wait longer than their initial estimate and who experienced delays near the end of their wait. The overall abandonment rate, meanwhile, stayed constant. In a study we conducted with Eric Webb, of the University of Cincinnati, and Kurt Bretthauer, of Indiana University, we found that the wait experience not only impacts customers’ behavior while in line but also their behavior once their turn arrives. My colleagues and I analyzed over 50,000 calls to a bank call center to explore the impact of wait time on their behavior once they were connected with a representative. We found that customers who waited longer than the expected wait time ended up also spending longer on the call once they were connected. This may be because customers who were forced to wait longer than expected spent more time complaining, or felt the need to ask for additional services in order to justify the extra time spent waiting. This suggests that providing pessimistic wait-time estimates can help companies to serve customers faster, thus increasing the number of customers that they can serve in a fixed amount of time. For example, if a restaurant provides more pessimistic estimates, their customers are likely to finish their meals more quickly, increasing the restaurant’s total throughput. Of course, all of these improvement hinge on a company’s ability to make accurate wait-time estimates. Improving your ability to estimate actual wait times is therefore a worthwhile investment. And when inherent uncertainty is high (such as for rideshare services, where both supply and demand can fluctuate wildly), it may be best to acknowledge this limited accuracy by providing the estimate in the form of an interval (as in, “Your estimated wait time is 5 to 10 minutes.” Another strategy, employed by the leading Chinese ridesharing platform Didi Chuxing, is to provide not just an estimated wait time interval but also the probability that the customer will be served within that interval (as in, “There is a 90% chance that you will be matched with a driver in 5 to 10 minutes”). This provides an additional level of transparency, which has been shown to increase trust and thus improve the customer experience. *** American spend roughly 37 billion hours each year waiting in line. A recent survey reported that wait-related issues are the number-one reason that retailers lose customers — and the rapid shift to online operations hasn’t made the problem go away. As queues go virtual, optimizing how you provide wait-time estimates is an inexpensive yet effective tool to significantly improve your customers’ experience."
"150",150,"https://hbr.org/2020/10/tech-is-transforming-people-analytics-is-that-a-good-thing","technology.txt","There is no question that new technologies, coupled with the near-ubiquitous digitization of work and work-related behaviors, has the potential to help organizations monitor, predict, and understand employee behaviors (and thoughts) at scale, like it has never been done before. At the same time, these same technologies, deployed in an unethical or illegal way, also permit employers to control and manipulate employees, violating trust and threatening not just their freedom and morale, but also their privacy. The only way to keep this from happening is through strict enforcement of adequate laws and regulations that ensure employees remain in the driver’s seat, able to authorize employers to use their data (or not), and benefiting from whatever insights and knowledge are derived from it. To be sure, there is no logical tension between what is good for the employer, and what is good for the employee. But the temptation to force people into certain behaviors, or to use their personal data against them, is more real than one would think. A century ago, Frederick Taylor’s Scientific Management laid the foundations for modern HR. His central premise was that organizations should turn their workplaces into real-world psychology labs, measuring and monitoring employees’ every move in order to boost their performance and reduce their stress levels. The paradigm was revolutionary, and led famous industrialists like Henry Ford to unprecedented innovations in human engineering, with the creation of the seminal assembly line, and a science-infused formula for optimizing roles, tasks, and job design to enhance employee productivity. Big companies, such as the Ford Motor Company, became a testing ground for applied psychology, and evidence-based HR was born. Fast forward 100 years or so, and it is all footnotes to Taylor. Some of the largest, most successful corporations, such as Google and Microsoft, are ramping up on data science, recruiting an army of Ph.D.’s in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, and accelerating their digital transformation to deploy smart technologies around AI and big data to improve their talent management systems. The people analytics age is here to stay, and it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But in a world of work that is increasingly virtual (and perhaps even only virtual), the volume of data available to understand and predict employees’ behaviors will continue to grow exponentially, enabling more opportunities for managing through tech and data. Broadly understood, people analytics is the HR function dedicated to the pursuit of data-driven insights about an organization’s workforce — yes, the geeky part of HR. Think of data as digital records of employees’ behaviors, and people analytics as the science that translates these data into actionable insights that improve the organization’s effectiveness. Most organizations sit on a wealth of data. We have repeatedly heard that “data is the new oil”, but data without insights are meaningless — just 0’s and 1’s. You need the right framework, model, or expertise to ensure that data acquires meaning, and the next stage of the process is to act on the basis of those insights to create data-driven decisions, changes, and a data-oriented culture, in an organization. As such, people analytics is a deliberate and systematic attempt to make organizations more evidence-based, talent-centric, and meritocratic, which, one would hope, should make them more effective. Consider the employee experience, which has traditionally been evaluated via annual surveys focused on job satisfaction or employee engagement. Although these measures are positively linked to job performance, the correlation is typically small (suggesting less than 20% overlap between engagement and productivity), and conflated with irrelevant factors, such as employees’ personality. It is also unreasonable to wait for an entire year to evaluate whether morale has gone up or down, so why not monitor this more regularly? This is where more regular “pulse surveys” and employee listening tools have started to gain popularity and can quickly be used to drive real action that benefits employees and businesses. Companies such as Glint, CultureAmp, Qualtrics, and Peakon are all able to help organizations to regularly “pulse” their employees to understand engagement and employee sentiment on a real-time basis. While employee listening has been around for a while, it has gained even more popularity in response to the Covid-19 crisis. Companies such as Rabobank, Merck, and National Australia Bank are all using employee listening to understand how their employees are coping with new remote working arrangements, how their needs for support are changing, and what their preferences are for returning to work. Using techniques such as stratified sampling (an alternative to random sampling that enables data scientists to partition a given sample into “strata” in order to make predictions about the population) and text analytics on free text comments (software that decodes words and word frequency into emotional sentiment or different psychological traits) and discussion boards, companies can gain valuable insights into what’s important to their employees in a rapidly changing environment, while avoiding survey fatigue and preserving anonymity at an individual level. Another important issue, particularly in the current context, is whether new technologies could be used to keep people safe, monitoring their mental and physical well-being. With widespread discussions right now on how employers can make their workplaces safe and ensure a healthy reopening of their offices in the post lockdown phase, it is not just the usual measures, such as temperature checking or social distancing, that may help. There are many ways that companies are implementing new technology to support their employees. Wearables can now monitor stress and anxiety, if employees choose to share that data. Chatbots that can be deployed to ask about your emotional state and provide advice. Of course, the same information could be used to support or control people: if you know how someone is feeling, what their physiological and psychological state is, that information could very well be used to help them and make them better, or, one would hope not, manipulate them and control them. This is true whenever technology enables other parties or individuals to gain insights into your deeper emotional states. Most notably, “track and trace” apps, such as those developed by Google and Apple in the U.S., which were instantly deployed by some governments (e.g., China, Singapore, and Israel) in response to the pandemic, could easily be adopted by employers to monitor and improve people’s health. Likewise, academics are partnering with wearable start-ups, such as in the case of Oura ring and UCSF, to translate the biometric data people are already sharing — willingly, of course — into a Covid-19 risk profile. Think of these innovations as the digital equivalent of having your temperature checked when you get to the office, or having a doctor on site checking for key symptoms. Although these measures are controversial, because they have the potential to intrude in people’s personal lives and hijack their privacy and anonymity, they are increasingly being adopted by large employers, and it is becoming harder to see the difference between those that are digital, and those that are analogue or physical, as the lines between our physical and digital lives themselves begin to blur. Another key goal may be to boost employee performance or productivity. In most organizations, this will always remain the main objective, even when companies care a lot about morale and well-being, largely because they see these things as being linked to performance. However, this is also where the “creepy” factor of monitoring can start to kick in. With phones, sensors, Alexa, wearables, and the IoT being more than capable of detecting and recording our moves, and opportunities to be truly offline and off the radar being rather minimal, it can all get rather invasive and Big Brother-like pretty quickly. For example, some companies are now looking to rollout more intrusive monitoring software that can take screenshots while employees work, and can track people’s movements as way of tracking productivity and monitoring a workforce that has become remote overnight. Earlier this year, PwC attracted considerable criticism for developing surveillance to track whether employees were away from their computers or not. Others are considering surveillance tools that will monitor the spread of Coronavirus within offices. But what is the trade-off that employees will have to make as we see a rise in the use of surveillance technology in response to the Covid-19 pandemic? If such tools become mandatory, under the guise of protecting the health of the workforce, then how can employees be sure that their privacy will be protected and their data won’t be used for other purposes? This is where HR departments must step in and drive a conversation that addresses employee trust, corporate responsibilities, and the ethical implications of any new technology, striking a balance between the needs of the employee, manager, and business. Although we are still at the very beginnings of this revolution, there have been clear advances in each of the major verticals of talent management, with a range of novel tools and technologies that, in some instances, are backed up by science. If leaders can instill a culture of trust, respect, and fairness in their organizations, and deploy these emerging innovations according to the strongest ethical and legal parameters (and that is not a small “if”), there is a real opportunity to make work significantly better. It’s not enough to hope that ethics are at the forefront when companies are considering new technology or people analytics projects. In our view, companies need to adopt an ethics charter for people analytics that helps them to clearly govern what they should or shouldn’t do, in the same way that they have guidelines for the usage of customer or financial data. In order to build and maintain employee trust in the use of people data, organizations need to tackle the ethics and privacy topic head on, being open and transparent with employees in how they are using their data. There is no question that technology, coupled with the near-ubiquitous digitization of work and work-related behaviors, has the potential to help organizations monitor, predict, and understand employee behaviors (and thoughts) at scale, like it has never been done before. At the same time, these same technologies, deployed in an unethical or illegal way, also permit employers to control and manipulate employees, violating trust and threatening not just their freedom and morale, but also their privacy.

Between commutes, formal meetings, drive-by chats, watercooler talks, coffee breaks, and lunches, you had many opportunities throughout your day where your eyes would have a break from your screen and detach from the digital realm. Now with those natural respites eliminated, there’s little to no break from the connection to technology. In particular, video calls add an extra layer of fatigue. Having to focus on multiple faces simultaneously while also being conscious that everyone can see you creates an added layer of mental and emotional exhaustion that wouldn’t be experienced as acutely in an in-person setting. The extra time in front of the computer can also cause eye strain and muscle fatigue because you need to hold your body rigid for hours to stay inside a camera’s range. To help my time management coaching clients maintain and regain energy, we’ve been working on ways that they can reduce or eliminate technology throughout their day. Here are a few strategies that have been most effective. Don’t default to Zoom Zoom and other video chat apps are wonderful tools when you are trying to get as close as possible to replicating in-person interactions. But the level of intensity video calling offers isn’t necessary for many communications. If a phone call would work fine for a conversation, use that. If you can efficiently communicate what you need via email or through updating a shared document or task management system, do that. Just because you can use video, doesn’t mean you should. Limit your meeting time In normal circumstances, setting aside blocks of time to get work done is a good idea. But if you find virtual meetings draining, this practice is even more essential for you right now. Block out time on your schedule where you’re not available for meetings so that you can temper how much virtual communication you have each day. That could look like setting aside most of a morning or afternoon as a meeting-free time or blocking out a few one-hour chunks of time throughout the day to detach and focus on other work. Choose physical over digital To counteract the increased time in front of a screen both on and off the clock, look for ways that you can take the low-tech route. Brainstorming for an article? Write out your thoughts on paper. Creating a road map for a big project? Sketch the initial draft on a white board. Reading a book? Pick up a print copy. Exercising? Go outside on a run. Anytime you can reasonably choose a physical option over a digital one, take it. I find that stepping away from my computer not only offers a digital break, but also in my experience helps me to be more creative. Move as much as possible To counteract the fatigue caused by sitting rigidly in front of your computer, move around as much as you can. In between meetings, take a walk to the kitchen to refill your water or coffee. When you need a quick break, do a few simple movements like rolling your shoulders to get the blood flowing. If you have a standing desk, move it up and down so you’re able to both sit and stand throughout the day. If you don’t have a standing desk, put your computer on a high counter or bureau to get an opportunity to stretch your legs. And if you’re on a normal phone call and don’t need to be taking notes or looking at documents while you talk, consider standing up or even walking back and forth during the conversation. Take tech-free breaks Although it may feel more “efficient” to eat lunch at your computer, your brain will thank you for taking a break from the screen. Eat lunch while chatting with your family members in the kitchen, looking out a window, or reading a physical book. Stepping away from technology not only gives your brain a break but also gives you the added bonus of perspective. I find that even when I take a short lunch of 15 to 20 minutes where I simply eat without doing anything else, I feel more peaceful at the end than I did before. I also find that I tend to have a clearer sense of the big picture of what’s occurring in my life and work. Another practice that’s benefiting myself as well as many of my time management coaching clients is post-work outdoor physical activity. This includes taking a walk, playing basketball in a driveway, gardening, or anything else that gets you active. This split from the digital world refreshes your brain and helps to create some separation from the end of your work day and the beginning of your personal time. When it’s possible to go back to more in-person communications, it will be a wonderful relief. But in the immediate term, some of the added digital load is unavoidable. These strategies can help you counter that load and reduce digital fatigue. If our free content helps you to contend with these challenges, please consider subscribing to HBR.

To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. The Covid-19 pandemic created an unprecedented strain on healthcare systems across the globe. Beyond the clinical, financial, and emotional impact of this crisis, the logistical implications have been daunting, with crippled supply chains, diminished capacity for elective procedures and outpatient care, and a vulnerable labor force. Among the most challenging aspects of the pandemic has been predicting its spread. The healthcare delivery infrastructure in much of the United States has faced the equivalent of an impending hurricane but without a national weather service to warn us where and when it will hit, and how hard. To build a forecasting model that works at the local level – within a hospital’s service area, for example — the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), relied on an embedded research group, the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, that reports to the CMO and is dedicated to applying rigorous research methods to study healthcare delivery questions. We used a series of methods derived from epidemiology, machine learning, and causal inference, to take a locally focused approach to predicting the timing and magnitude of Covid-19 clinical demands for our hospital. This forecasting serves as an example of a new opportunity in healthcare operations that is particularly useful in times of extreme uncertainty. In early February, as the U.S. was grappling with the rapid spread of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, the healthcare community in Boston began to brace for the months ahead. Later that month, participants in a biotechnology conference and other residents returning from overseas travel were diagnosed with the new disease. It was the start of a public health emergency. To understand how to respond, our hospital needed a Covid-warning system, just as coastal towns need hurricane warning systems. Our hospital is an academic medical center with over 670 licensed beds, of which 77 are intensive care beds. We knew it was hurricane season, but when would the storm arrive, and how hard would it hit? We were uncertain about what lay ahead. Lesson 1: National forecasting models broke down when predicting hospital capacity for Covid-19 patients because no local variables were included. Our institution turned first to national models. The most widely used national model applied curve-fitting methods (which draw a best-fit curve on a series of data points) on earlier Covid-19 data from other countries to predict future developments in the United States. National models did not consider local hospital decision-making or local-level socioeconomic factors which dramatically impact key variables like population density, pre-existing health status, and reliance on public transportation. For example, social media data showed many student-dense neighborhoods in Boston emptying after colleges canceled in-person classes at the beginning of March, which meant fewer people were in Boston to contract the virus. Another critical variable in hospital capacity forecasting, the rate of hospitalization for people with Covid-19, varied as the weeks went on, even though national models held this variable constant. For example, early on our hospital was choosing to admit rather than send home many SARS-COV-2 positive patients, even with mild infections, because the clinical trajectory of the disease was so uncertain. Thus we needed a dynamic hyper-local model. Building our storm alert system Lesson 2: Local infection modeling required a range of different research methods, and the trust and commitment of operational leaders who recognized the value of the work. The hospital turned to our research center to achieve these goals. The center, which is embedded in the hospital and reports to the Chief Medical Officer (Dr. Weiss), brought applied machine learning and epidemiological approaches to construct a hyper-local alert system. To demonstrate the feasibility of forecasting local hospital-capacity needs for managing Covid-19 patients, we built a preliminary SIR model (a traditional epidemiological framework that models the number of Susceptible, Infected and Recovered people in a population), which was integrated into our institution’s incident command structure, an ad hoc team created with members of the hospital and disaster management leadership to respond to the pandemic. However, the accuracy of SIR models depends on the accuracy of estimates of disease characteristics such as incubation time, infectious period, and transmissibility, variables that are still not well understood. Therefore, we turned to machine learning approaches, harnessing real-time data from our electronic medical record to determine these variables directly from real patients. We also gathered Covid-patient census data from multiple hospitals simultaneously, using a common machine-learning technique called multi-task learning to capitalize on limited data. These methods allowed us to estimate when the demand for hospital capacity to treat Covid-19 patients would peak and plateau — predicting the timing to within five days of the true peak and more accurately modeling the slope of the peak and decline than national models did. Had leadership relied on national models, they would have expected a sharper peak and decline, and a peak two weeks earlier than the actual peak. Our modeling affected key decisions, including the need to bolster personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies; to gauge the necessity of even urgent procedures, and postpone them if necessary in order assure we had the capacity to absorb the peak; and to establish staffing schedules that continued farther into the future than those originally planned. Lesson 3: Effective modeling in confusing times may require rapidly developing new methods for predicting the next storm. Hospitals now face a difficult challenge. We need to open our doors to the patients without Covid-19 who didn’t seek care or whose care was deferred. But how do we make sure to have enough protective equipment for safely bringing back outpatient procedures? And when can nurses who had been redeployed to our ICUs return to the floors and interventional areas such as the endoscopy suite and cardiac catheterization lab? Complicating these questions is whether we will see another rise in infections with changes in state-wide policies, reopening of schools and businesses, or a coming influenza season. In this new phase, we now need to develop methods for understanding how people will move within a community (going to school and visiting stores, for instance) and how much they will interact with one another and, therefore, affect the risk of infection over time. To this end, we constructed a risk index for local businesses by comparing pre-pandemic traffic to traffic as they reopen, and whether they are indoors or partly or entirely outdoors. Businesses where visitors are densely packed in indoor spaces, especially for longer periods, have a higher risk index — meaning they are more likely to be the site of infection spread. Using our risk index, we created and validated a model for identifying such potential “super-spreader” businesses in our service area. This analysis is part of another body of research that will undergo peer review and publication and, therefore, its results are provisional. Meanwhile, we can use our work with businesses to further inform our forecasting model by examining traffic in business locations we have identified as high-risk and assessing whether incorporating these data improves the ability of our model to predict the demand on hospital capacity. Lesson 4: Given the profound future uncertainty in healthcare, small investments in trusted internal research groups that can answer operational questions with new methods can yield substantial returns. Our institution made a prescient investment in creating an embedded and trusted research group made up of clinicians, economists, and epidemiologists studying healthcare operations. The team has brought specialized machine learning methods and expertise in extracting conclusions from messy data to quickly and accurately solve emerging real-world problems — capabilities that traditional business analytics groups are less likely to have. Other organizations can similarly unite the rigor and flexibility of methodological experts with the need to rapidly answer operational questions in dynamic and even chaotic environments.

"153",153,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/have-your-privacy-policies-kept-up-with-your-digital-transformation","technology.txt","For every business that shifts operations online, there are potential privacy pitfalls that will prove very damaging if mismanaged. As new regulations are set to go into force in the United States, the stakes for getting this pivot right are higher than ever before. The Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating digital transformations, and companies should consider implementing these four privacy-focused measures: 1) Check how your vendors and partners use customer data, 2) Perform impact assessments to monitor risk, 3) Strive for clarity in your privacy policy, and 4) Designate a data protection officer. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. For companies everywhere, Covid-19 has expedited digital transformation at almost unimaginable speed. In an effort to survive and get back to business safely, companies have rapidly adopted services such as contactless payment, click-and-collect applications, and enhanced customer relationship management. These transitions are vital for business to continue, but each also introduces new risks. For every business that shifts operations online, there are potential privacy pitfalls that will prove very damaging if mismanaged, and as new regulations are set to go into force in the United States, the stakes for getting this pivot right are higher than ever before. Across industries, teams with expertise in real-world spaces are rushing into digital ones where they’re novices and pumping huge amounts of user data into new systems. In the restaurant industry, establishments are scrambling to build new online ordering and delivery infrastructure or to partner with companies who already offer those services. In higher education, institutions faced with missing out on a year’s tuition fees are rapidly migrating their entire curriculum online, and rushing to digitize everything from online teaching to student health records. In the live events space, production veterans are being asked to migrate their well-established processes online and into new cloud technologies. In each case, these changes carry the risk that reams of personal data will be mismanaged and vulnerable to exposure. This situation raises two major challenges for many businesses: First, they need to make quick decisions on procuring new technology: building online storefronts, implementing communications platforms that process customers’ personal data, and more. Second, they lack experience with data processing infrastructure, or even technology in general. That adds up to teams making quick decisions on the use of technology systems they don’t know much about. There might be an understandable temptation to treat privacy concerns as a secondary issue — one that can be addressed after the immediate crisis — but that would be a mistake, and one which would place companies at elevated risk of monetary fines, class-action lawsuits, and PR headaches. There’s been growing regulatory pressure on both sides of the Atlantic. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which was implemented in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States, which becomes enforceable by law on July 1 (impacting any company with a presence in California and over $25 million in annual revenue), contain stringent protocols for the management of user data, and both threaten steep fines for businesses that get data wrong. Particularly in the United States, there’s little reason to think that regulators will meaningfully relax standards because of the pandemic. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has been unambiguous in his intent to press forward on implementing CCPA, stating: “We’re committed to enforcing the law starting July 1. We encourage businesses to be particularly mindful of data security in this time of emergency.” The good news is that managing privacy concerns doesn’t have to be yet another daunting task on top of the already Herculean feat of moving large parts of your business online. There are a number of simple, meaningful steps you can take to minimize the risk of a privacy breach. To make your rapid digital transformation as safe as reasonably possible in the coming months, consider implementing these privacy-focused measures. Each can be done independently, but if your business can tick all four of these boxes, you’ll greatly mitigate privacy risk: Businesses may be tempted to rush into contracts with third-party vendors who promise “plug-and-play” solutions to a number of digital transformation challenges. And while companies may be aware that they must review any Data Processing Agreements (DPA) during procurement, there is a tendency to underestimate the consequences of skipping this step. Under CCPA and GDPR, a business can be held financially liable for failure to perform due diligence on third parties that process customer data — in fact, this was the scenario that led to Marriott Hotel Group being fined $123 million by ICO in 2019. Your key focus when reviewing vendor DPAs should be ensuring they’re privacy compliant and that their data policies align with your business’s stated data policies — otherwise a business runs the risk of violating their own privacy policy. Additionally, check the language about subcontractors in any vendor DPA. There should be assurance that vendors won’t subcontract to another processor unless explicitly instructed by your business to do so. This ensures your business is legally protected if a vendor unilaterally offloads data duties to a non-compliant third party. Impact assessments for data processing are required in many cases by GDPR, but not required by the CCPA. However in times of frenetic change, implementing basic risk assessments for data activities — however tedious — forces businesses to think critically before making a potentially damaging decision on issues like data storage, subcontracting, and more. Furthermore, in the event of being charged with a privacy violation, a paper trail demonstrating proactive steps to mitigate risk reads favorably to regulators. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office provides a free data protection impact assessment template that will set your business on the right track to accurately assessing privacy risk, whether you’re based there or not. As key stakeholders reevaluate privacy policies ahead of CCPA enforcement, consider how the document reads. Your goal is to make this policy accessible to all of your customers — not just those fluent in legalese. You might think you’re covering yourself by including phrases wide open to interpretation to prepare for any future regulatory requirement, but your priority should be to help your increasingly privacy-savvy customers understand your policy and trust your company. Slack’s privacy policy shows that thoroughness doesn’t have to come at the expense of clarity for readers. No matter a business’s size, centralizing responsibility for data decisions is preferable to diffusing responsibility across multiple departments. That is truer than ever during times of rapid change. DPOs serve as a focal point for privacy concerns within an organization and a vital liaison to regulatory bodies while the character of privacy law enforcement remains ambiguous. Even if the person lacks privacy experience, empowering a single set of eyes to focus on privacy is a quick, cost-conscious way to de-risk. As stated at the outset, managing rapid digital transformation well can require taking risky action. But in the current climate, depending on regulatory largesse is an unnecessary risk for businesses when they can take simple, process-driven steps to shore up privacy. Data privacy implementation exhibits many features of the economist’s “time inconsistency” dilemma – it’s too soon to do it until it’s too late. And as we’ve seen in the last few weeks, “too late” can mean a serious stumble at a critical business juncture.

"154",154,"https://hbr.org/2020/05/digital-transformation-is-about-talent-not-technology","technology.txt","Contrary to popular belief, digital transformation is less about technology, and more about people. You can pretty much buy any technology, but your ability to adapt to an even more digital future depends on developing the next generation of skills, closing the gap between talent supply and demand, and future-proofing your own and others’ potential. It’s really quite simple: the most brilliant innovation is irrelevant if we are not skilled enough to use it; and even the most impressive human minds will become less useful if they don’t team up with technology. The main implication is that when leaders think about investing in technology, they should first think about investing in the people who can make that technology useful. As The Economist recently noted, one of the most obvious consequences of the current Covid-19 pandemic will be “the infusion of data-enabled services into ever more aspects of life.” We expect digital transformation to be an even bigger imperative for organizations in the short-term future. Contrary to popular belief, digital transformation is less about technology and more about people. You can pretty much buy any technology, but your ability to adapt to an even more digital future depends on developing the next generation of skills, closing the gap between talent supply and demand, and future-proofing your own and others’ potential. As it turns out, most of us end up in jobs and careers for serendipitous reasons, and stay in them for a long time, rarely pausing to rethink our potential: Am I in the right job? Is my career the best fit for by interests and abilities? Would I enjoy my life more if I had chosen something else? Furthermore, while every job requires learning, we are prewired for familiarity, routine, and simplicity, which is why most of us end up learning less on the job, the more time we actually spend on the job. This is good in the short run, because we can do our jobs on autopilot, freeing up mental resources; yet it’s counterproductive in the long run, because what we gain in experience, we miss in new learning opportunities. An even bigger loss is that we may go through our entire working lives without discovering, let alone unlocking, our true potential. As Winston Churchill once said, we should never waste a good crisis. Perhaps this is the biggest gift of the current pandemic, that it provides us with the opportunity to rethink our potential and ensure that we are positioning ourselves toward the future. To be sure, it is too soon for most people to realize this, yet in the long-term, a significant number of people will likely end up in better careers and look back on their less meaningful and less engaging past careers like someone who looks back without regret on the end of a less fulfilling personal relationship, even one where it wasn’t their choice to exit. With this in mind, we wanted to provide a few suggestions: some based on science, and some based on our own experiences leading, coaching, and mentoring current and future leaders across a wide range of industries, helping them ready themselves for an even-more-digital future. Our main assumption here is straightforward: While the future is more ambivalent and uncertain than ever, we are confident that a pretty strong bet on the future is to focus on reskilling and upskilling people so that they are better equipped to adjust to change. Just as our past efforts have enabled us to adapt to our more digital and virtual present world (and a non-trivial fact is that we are writing this, and you are probably reading this, in physical isolation), there are few reasons to suggest that this trend will go away or be reversed anytime soon. If anything, an even bigger proportion of jobs, tasks, activities, and careers will find ingenious and novel ways to coexist in the digital world. Here’s how we can all prepare for that eventuality: As the last several weeks have demonstrated, we are agile as a global community. This agility has been people-led and technology-supported. Human beings are the common denominator to the concept of future proofing, whether it’s as a complement to the technology being unleashed for remote working, or whether it’s because we possess the soft skills and leadership needed to navigate a historic crisis, or because we have the insights needed to drive slow success or fast failure for a cure. It all starts with each and every one of us, and those we are responsible for developing. The key is to nurture curiosity, so we have options, even outside of a crisis.

"155",155,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/the-ceo-of-slack-on-adapting-in-response-to-a-global-crisis","technology.txt","Slack was launched in 2014, went public in 2019, and is now a global operation with more than 2,000 employees and 100,000-plus customers. But it hasn’t lost its start-up mentality. And never did it move with more speed and clarity of focus than in March 2020, when the Covid-19 crisis brought on two challenges: dramatically increasing customer demand and an extremely abrupt transition to working remotely. The company’s customer success and experience teams delivered nearly round-the-clock support free, both to existing customers and to newcomers who needed help getting set up with the product. Interviews with job candidates and the employee onboarding process were moved online. Marketing developed a public service ad for television committing to help any groups that were working on a Covid-19 response. Slack’s engineers ensured that its systems were operational 99.9% of the time in a period of soaring demand. Customers with 1,000 or 10,000 Slack users suddenly wanted to expand to 50,000. New customers wanted comprehensive proposals immediately. Organizations of all kinds had to transform the way they worked, all at once. This crisis, Butterfield writes, “has created an opportunity for us and others to become more agile, to take on changes that once seemed daunting, to reimagine organizational culture…and to reposition for future growth.” As the CEO of a company that went from a launch in 2014 to a public listing in 2019, I’ve been through plenty of periods of rapid acceleration, and so has the entire team at Slack. We’re now a global operation with more than 2,000 employees and 100,000-plus paid customers, but we haven’t lost our start-up mentality. Our vision is a world where organizational agility is easy to achieve, regardless of an institution’s size, and that agility is what we aim for ourselves. But we have never moved with more speed—and clarity of focus—than we did this past March. As the magnitude of the Covid-19 crisis became clear, we realized that we would need to meet twin challenges: dramatically increasing customer demand and an extremely abrupt transition to working remotely. The first week of March was not much different from the weeks prior. Because of the outbreak in China and fears of a spread in Asia, we had already decided to close our offices in Tokyo and Osaka. We also decided to make our annual global sales offsite, an 800-person gathering scheduled for March 9–13, an online-only event, and we issued an optional work-from-home policy and recommended travel restrictions for the entire company. We’d noticed an uptick in new teams based in Japan, South Korea, and Italy; we launched resources, including webinars and one-on-one live consultations, for people in those and other virus-hit areas who were shifting to remote work. At the same time, however, we were of course continuing all our normal operations—closing customer deals, launching features, making hires, and so on. On Thursday, March 5, we held the regularly scheduled board of directors meeting at our San Francisco headquarters to discuss plans for the new fiscal year, including budgets and forecasts for various parts of the business, hiring, new-office leases, and the quarterly guidance we would soon issue—only our third earnings announcement as a public company. To give you a sense of just how different things were then: Cal Henderson, Slack’s cofounder and our CTO, attended the board meeting in person even though he had just returned from Asia with sniffles and sneezes. One board member questioned Cal’s presence and suggested that we might not be taking the health crisis as seriously as we should, but his was the lone voice of caution at the time. (Thankfully, Cal had just a cold.) Within hours it was obvious that the board member had been right. We learned that one of our Bay Area employees had been contacted by the Centers for Disease Control about possible coronavirus exposure and had begun self-quarantining. We immediately decided to temporarily close the offices where the employee worked and have them deep-cleaned the next day. Meanwhile, the news from Europe and both the West and East Coasts was worsening, and calls increased for widespread social distancing. By Friday, just 24 hours later, we knew that we needed to close every other Slack office along with the ones in Japan—16 locations in nine countries. Our own work was far from the only thing on our minds, though. In some ways Slack the company was ready for this: We live day in and day out with Slack the product, which keeps us connected whether we’re in the office, on the road, at home, or anywhere in between. But we knew that thousands of other companies would have to make a massive, rapid transition to remote work. And many—existing customers scaling up more rapidly and prospective ones desperate to do the same—would want our help. I will never forget the energy, focus, and determination I saw from our employees over the next few weeks. It was as if everything I had ever hoped to accomplish for our team—a clear sense of purpose, widely understood shared objectives, and appreciation for the importance of our work, all inspiring genuine collaboration—was happening magically, by itself. Of course, we will all remember this pandemic period for the rest of our lives. And like everyone else, I’m worried about loved ones, deeply concerned for the millions whose lives have been upended, preoccupied by the strain and craziness of quarantine (some days more than others), and profoundly uncertain about how things will unfold. But for us at Slack, the time has also been indelibly marked by the experience of coming together to help one another, our customers (old and new), and so many groups on the front lines of this crisis. It was that month, March 2020, in which the company itself demonstrated the agility that we aspire to bring to our customers. I think our story offers lessons for other corporations and institutions, not just in times of crisis but whenever they need to adapt to unexpected changes, move quickly, and strategically scale up. Slack’s origins trace back to the team that began working together at a company I cofounded in 2002. After giving up on the project that first drew us together—developing a web-based massively multiplayer game—we ended up creating the photo-sharing tool Flickr, which was acquired by Yahoo in 2005. In 2009 the four of us left Yahoo and cofounded another company to create…another web-based massively multiplayer game. Though we were more experienced and better resourced, the game, called Glitch, was wildly ambitious and ended up caught in a major technology shift as computing-for-leisure moved to mobile. We spent three and a half years working on it but again had to pull the plug. However, the software we’d developed to connect our cross-functional team—from software developers, customer support, and business operations to artists, animators, writers, and musicians—showed a lot of promise. We committed our remaining funding to its development, built the app and platform, and in August 2013 began a closed beta for Slack: a “searchable log of all communication and knowledge.” Since then we’ve become an NYSE-listed company that grew revenue 57% last year, to $630 million, with enterprise customers including IBM, TD Ameritrade, GlaxoSmithKline, and Uber. We’re rapidly growing and heavily reinvesting, so we’re still not profitable. But we closed the past fiscal year (which for us ended on January 31, 2020) with 110,000 paying customers, nearly 900 of which spend more than $100,000 a year with us and 70 of which spend more than $1 million. That’s what we reported on our March 12 earnings call. At the same time, we were flying into the future, figuring out how we would work as an all-remote organization, how best to help our customers, and how to preserve momentum as the pandemic spread and a recession loomed. First and foremost, our response began with the health and safety of our employees. Fortunately, the employee whose possible exposure prompted our first office closure never showed any symptoms and remains well. Our hearts go out to those who have been infected, and we are extremely thankful for the caregivers tending the sick, the scientists researching treatments, and all the frontline workers who have kept food and other essentials moving around the world. We didn’t need to get people up to speed on Slack. We hit the ground running. As an organization built around—and through—a channel-based messaging platform and made up mostly of knowledge workers, we transitioned to work from home relatively easily. Our entire business runs on Slack: communication and collaboration happen in channels, and we have a channel for every project, initiative, function, team, office location, large customer, event, and everything else. As a result, everyone knows where to go to ask their questions, give their updates, or catch up on decisions and results. We’ve always invested in a strong and disciplined culture of communication. “Slack 101” and “102” classes are literally part of our onboarding process. We didn’t need to get people up to speed on Slack or scramble to find tools to help us connect with one another remotely. We were ready, and we hit the ground running. This was a crisis, and we had a product that could genuinely help people get through it and continue to work efficiently, whether in individual teams or in large organizations. We realized that this was our moment. We all felt a new sense of urgency and alignment: If we add this feature today, our users will be able to work more easily and effectively tomorrow. If we provide the right resources now, thousands of new customers will sign up and stick with us in the future. If we help this group of researchers work together even though they’re apart, maybe they will defeat the virus. Of course, most of that is always true, and as CEO, I’m constantly trying to hammer home how each little improvement matters. But the changes sparked by Covid-19 made that truth obvious. I didn’t have to say anything. Everyone at Slack had the same instinct to prioritize the most important work. Meetings are a great example. The hesitation, equivocation, and desire for “more research” that can cause decisions to be punted from one recurring meeting to the next? Those stopped right away. Our first employee “all-hands” while working from home lasted 22 minutes instead of an hour. Business unit leaders scrapped their long presentations in favor of 30- to 90-second updates on what was critically important. I dialed in from my laundry room because that was where I had the strongest WiFi signal. When our CMO was talking, her two daughters unexpectedly popped up on the screen. She didn’t skip a beat. That got smiles at the time, but it was also called out later by employees as a significant moment in which our leaders demonstrated acceptance of the new reality. Our chief people officer, who has four young, rambunctious boys and a wife who also works, soon told everyone that he had a changed policy on meetings: He was available for them only between 11 AM and 2 PM. Many of us had added responsibilities and real challenges; it was important to recognize that and accept the need for flexibility. We didn’t have to strictly adhere to previous norms. We were focused on impact. Our customer success and experience teams turned on the afterburners and delivered support more or less around the clock, expanding online training tools; launching live, personalized assistance; and making it all free—both to existing customers and to newcomers who needed help getting set up with our product. Account executives sent emails to all their clients explaining our business-continuity plans and asking how we could help them through the crisis. New Slack channels were spun up to manage all the new workstreams, including changing hundreds of on-site interviews with job candidates to videoconferences and redesigning our employee onboarding process to be completely remote. Our marketing and communications teams postponed in-person events and, in less than a week, developed our first television ad as a listed company: a public service announcement committing to help any groups (scientists, doctors, academics, researchers, designers) that were working on a Covid-19 response. Our network operations and infrastructure engineers not only ensured that our systems were operational 99.99% of the time in a period of soaring demand, but also rolled out a planned redesign on March 18. Members of our facilities team, who couldn’t go into our offices, volunteered to get trained and support the customer service team by helping answer incoming questions. Decisions were made faster as the usual concerns and hesitations and reasons not to move forward fell away. Even better, we all acted on a new, unspoken mantra: If you see something that needs to be done, just go ahead and do it. The natural transparency of Slack itself, of course, made it easier to move at this kind of speed while staying aligned. All this work, especially under these radically new and different circumstances, can be its own reward, but it can also be a serious source of stress. Mental health, always critical, is even more so during a crisis. Employees can’t perform well if they think they might be let go or are pushing themselves too hard. We were fortunate in that people didn’t need to worry about their job security. Instead I found myself reminding them all to take care of themselves. At the start of the second week of March, I sent a message assuring everyone that we were confident about our overall financial health and the long-term growth potential of our business, and that we had no plans for layoffs. In fact, we would keep up hiring across the company (and even accelerate it for customer support roles), and we continue to pay contractors and hourly workers. Founded: 2009 (as Tiny Spec)Headquarters: San FranciscoNo. of employees: 2,000+Offices worldwide: 16 At the end of that week I sent another note encouraging employees to prioritize their own and their families’ well-being. I am fortunate to be holed up with a supportive fiancée, who’s the cofounder and chief brand officer of her own company, along with two dogs (one a puppy, who provides a welcome diversion). But I knew that some people were managing young kids at home with neither school nor childcare, while others were completely on their own and feeling isolated. This was not going to change in the short term (at the time of this writing, we plan to keep our offices closed through September), so things like breaks, exercise, sleep, and eating well were more important than ever. We also wanted people to ask for help if they needed it. I knew that with sufficient focus, we could accommodate all this and still get more done. And that’s just what happened. Although the growth in new teams using Slack in Asia and Italy was a harbinger of things to come, none of us were prepared for the global surge in customer demand that hit us in mid-March. Companies that already had all their people on Slack were using it much more—20% more messages per person per day than before the crisis hit. Our record for simultaneous users jumped from 10 million on March 10 to 12.5 million on March 25 (25% growth in two weeks!), and our active use time on weekdays increased to one billion minutes globally. Customers with 1,000 or 10,000 Slack users suddenly wanted to expand to 50,000. A large U.S.-based grocery chain had about 1,200 people on Slack and asked for a plan to roll it out to 100,000 people in 72 hours. The last time we’d ramped up at that scale for a customer, it had taken 15 months. New customers wanted comprehensive proposals immediately. Existing ones wanted more training programs and more-sophisticated features, which caused our app installation rate to more than triple. We’d been on pace to add 5,000 new paying teams per quarter; as of mid-March, just over halfway through the first quarter of our fiscal 2021, we had already added 9,000. Customers with 1,000 or 10,000 Slack users suddenly wanted to expand to 50,000. Suddenly organizations of all kinds, small and large, private and public, needed to transform the way they worked, all at once. Many leaders were under pressure to develop transition plans. Managers were trying to figure out how to handle newly remote teams. Our job was to use our expertise to help relieve that burden, and we worked flat out to guide people to more-effective Slack use. It was especially satisfying to be able to facilitate the work of teams key to Covid-19 mitigation and relief: government agencies, medical professionals, equipment makers, treatment and vaccine researchers, media and scientific organizations covering the crisis, and nonprofits providing relief to those suffering the most from it. We continue to offer free trials and have expanded the features those organizations can use while offering free upgrades to paid plans. Our hope is that people who’ve tried Slack during this crisis will appreciate its benefits and never go back to email. More broadly, I think any company that enables businesses’ transformation through software will have an easier time of it going forward: All kinds of things that seemed impossibly hard a few months ago turned out to be manageable once it was clear they had to happen. However, until testing spreads and a vaccine is developed and rolled out, we will be coping with a pandemic and its terrible fallout. The number of deaths is staggering. Tens of millions of people are now unemployed. Businesses are closed, and many will never reopen. National economies are entering what will probably be a prolonged recession. We don’t know what that means for Slack. It’s likely that some of our existing customers, particularly small companies and those in the travel and hospitality industries, will drop off—although we’ve been working with those hardest hit to find workable solutions. Large enterprises are likely to clamp down on new spending and cut existing costs. I heard from one executive that the wall-to-wall contract his company had just signed with us in the second week of March was its last big purchase before tightening up. These competing dynamics—a clear increase in short-term demand coupled with a murkier outlook for the rest of the year and maybe beyond—are our new reality. That’s what we had to communicate to investors. Less than a week after that relatively run-of-the-mill board meeting on March 5, I was in New York, prepping for our earnings call. Things looked good: We were growing quickly and felt well positioned against competitors, most notably Microsoft Teams. The evening of March 11 I worked late with our CFO and investor relations and communications teams and then met friends at an oyster place on Canal Street for snacks and a drink. I vividly remember that night for several reasons, not least because it would be my last in-person restaurant meal for some time. Tom Hanks announced he’d tested positive for Covid-19; the NBA suspended its season; and President Trump imposed a travel ban from some countries to the United States. Suddenly the financial guidance we’d prepared to release on the earnings call seemed out-of-date. And now that we were in a situation that could result in millions of deaths, it felt surreal to be thinking or talking about macroeconomic headwinds or tailwinds. In debating whether and how to change our financial forecasts, we realized there was no down-the-middle scenario. The pandemic was going to affect our business. We knew, however, that even if we were badly hit, we would be better off than many other companies. So we tempered our first-half growth expectations and acknowledged the increasing market uncertainty but presented the same case we’d intended to, with undiminished confidence. We soon had to make another decision. We’d considered doing a $600 million convertible debt raise in March. One of the reasons we’d gone public was to gain access to the public debt market. At first it seemed that the pandemic would prevent us from pursuing that financing; we thought, Too bad we couldn’t pull that off before the markets went crazy. But even in the craziness we realized that we could, and should, follow through with the financing. As someone who’s weathered more than a few financial and tech industry crises, I’ve learned that raising capital when it’s available, even if you don’t need it, is rarely something you’ll regret. If sources dry up, the cash you secured will be a big advantage: Acquisitions will become possible, and you can invest in new hires, marketing, or infrastructure in an environment where most others can’t. We set up a multi-organization Slack channel with the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and instead of an in-person road show, we did video calls with potential investors. Demand was so great that we increased the offering size to $750 million and still found ourselves oversubscribed. That was gratifying. We’d chosen to enter the debt market during a very turbulent period and had been rewarded for it. I’ve always believed in the adage “Never waste a crisis,” and during this one I’ve tried to encourage Slack’s executive team, employees, customers, and investors to lean into that idea. Covid-19 has created an opportunity for us and others to become more agile, to take on changes that once seemed daunting, to reimagine organizational culture, to rethink work plans and productivity, to learn from and rapidly correct mistakes, and to reposition for future growth. Perhaps most important, Slack has refocused on our core goal—to help our customers work more efficiently and more productively. What leaders must do above all else in times like these is remind people of what’s important, emphasizing an organization’s foundational tenets, its purpose and mission, and the impact it can have, and constantly expressing gratitude for the hard work they’re doing to execute on those things. As I wrote to Slack employees on March 12, “We can emerge from this stronger than ever….We will look back at this time and realize how much it redefined our belief in what we can accomplish as a team….Everything you’re doing matters. I’m so proud of this company, and all of you. Let’s go!”"
"156",156,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/retailers-face-a-data-deficit-in-the-wake-of-the-pandemic","technology.txt","The change in consumer behavior caused by Covid-19 has created an unexpected problem: an information deficit, as data from before the crisis can’t effectively predict new trends. In other words, the essential ingredient for retail customer loyalty programs, AI-driven product recommendations, and a wide array of critical business decisions now has a quality issue. Retailers can deal with this problem by taking five steps: 1) Stand up new channels for data collection and communication, 2) leverage “Covid-19-aware” data sources that are capturing consumer behavior indicators at present, 3) revisit revenue projections to account for the new constraints imposed on shopping due to Covid-19, 4) use spatial analysis in conjunction with relevant Covid-19 health ordinances and regulations to analyze where it makes the most sense to focus attention upon reopening, and 5) take this opportunity to give attention to the infrastructure supporting key data assets. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. When stay-at-home orders took hold this past March, retail sales dropped dramatically — as everybody knows. But that change in customer behavior has resulted in a phenomenon that hasn’t been talked about much: the flow of sales information to retailers’ data repositories has dried up. That’s a significant problem, because a healthy flow of that information is the lifeblood of customer loyalty programs, AI-driven product recommendations, and a wide array of critical business decisions. What this change means is that many retailers – independent or chain, brick-and-mortar or e-commerce, startup or legacy – are now facing an information deficit. That’s what happens when the data and intelligence derived from customer transactions becomes scarce or unusable due to a sudden change in buyer behavior. Today the problem is widespread: Even businesses that had amassed great volumes of customer data before Covid-19 are finding themselves in the same cold-start position as businesses venturing into unknown markets or reaching out to new audiences. The effects of this disruption could be massive in the mid- to long term, because it obviously makes customer behavior more challenging to interpret, to predict, and to pattern. In the current context, this much is clear: Businesses should not take for granted that the data they gathered before Covid-19 will accurately predict buyer behavior in the socially distant economy. Instead, retailers must take careful stock of the data inputs and analytical assumptions that now drive their products and business decision-making. They must identify the risks of carrying on with the status quo, and they must respond to the challenges of the moment with creativity and innovation. This recalibration exercise will help retailers quickly figure out how to stay relevant as American consumers change. In our post-stay-at-home reality, companies need to recognize that their existing predictive models, forecasts, and dashboards may all be unreliable, or even obsolete, and that their analytic tools need recalibrating. Although the objectives of a specific automated system or predictive model may not have changed, the input data and the users certainly have, which should cause companies to re-evaluate how outputs are interpreted and relied upon. Companies also need to avoid making shortsighted decisions about data infrastructure and human resources. Although staff reductions can help to offset immediate profit loss, eliminating the people who know how to organize, clean, mine, and model customer data can create intractable technical debt. When making resource decisions, leaders must truly understand which systems will suffer as a result of losing a specific role, then quantify and weigh the longer-term cost of any fallout. The changes we’ve recently witnessed in customer behavior have left some companies feeling as though they’ve been dropped in the middle of the woods without a compass. The classic “Who is our customer?” question has suddenly become harder than ever to answer. Are current online shoppers repeat customers who migrated from brick-and-mortar stores, or are they net new customers? Retail businesses have always had a blind spot in this area, but until now they haven’t had much reason to prioritize it. Those who make the most of the current stay-at-home moment to gain clarity here could make transformative discoveries that will serve them well beyond 2020. Which brings us to some good news: This situation represents an opportunity for companies that have not ever fully harnessed data to make evidence-based business decisions. Before the pandemic struck, these companies lagged behind data-mature companies, but as data-mature companies are now struggling to contend with a sudden information deficit, the less data-mature companies have a one-time opportunity to build their data-gathering capabilities and enhance their data-driven decision-making. For a brief period, at least, they’ve got a chance to catch up. In this moment, it’s important for all companies, no matter how data-mature, to remember that “customer data” is not limited to point-of-sale transactions. Retailers should consider data to be any information that is relevant to their customers’ behavior that can be ethically collected, organized, and studied for insights that decision-makers can rely on. As restrictions on public life continue to ease and shopping resumes, retailers must get creative about where and how to collect this information. They should, for example, broaden their understanding of shopper behavior to include anything that signals the way a customer relates to a company and its products. There’s lots more companies should do: They should study which messages resonate with different customer segments. They should measure their expectations for fulfillment. They should characterize the nuanced ways customers’ purchasing patterns have been transformed. Companies must not let a temporary reduction in transactions or three months of distorted data impact their ability to make informed decisions. Using the analytical methods of data science, they have to weave many threads together to fashion business resilience in the face of uncertainty. To defend against an information deficit, it’s essential to understand what relevant data are available and how those data can be reengineered to answer contemporary questions. Companies can examine their own existing data within a smaller timeframe or even design a survey to get a fresh pulse on customers’ needs and plans. Moreover, refreshing machine-learning models and analytic tools will help companies get back on track and begin competing anew. Here are some ideas available to retailers to get in front of the information deficit problem. Covid-19 will eventually fade away, but that does not mean business decision-making should resume its prior incarnation. Data and quality analysis will remain essential instruments for making wise decisions about customers. Retailers that can harness data quickly and smartly will maintain their business and a competitive advantage in the long run.

"157",157,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/a-better-way-to-onboard-ai","technology.txt","In a 2018 Workforce Institute survey of 3,000 managers across eight industrialized nations, the majority of respondents described artificial intelligence as a valuable productivity tool. But respondents to that survey also expressed fears that AI would take their jobs. They are not alone. The Guardian recently reported that in the UK “more than 6 million workers fear being replaced by machines.” AI’s advantages can be cast in a dark light: Why would humans be needed when machines can do a better job? To allay such fears, employers must set AI up to succeed rather than to fail. The authors draw on their own and others’ research and consulting on AI and information systems implementation, along with organizational studies of innovation and work practices, to present a four-phase approach to implementing AI. It allows organizations to cultivate people’s trust—a key condition for adoption—and to work toward a distributed cognitive system in which humans and artificial intelligence both continually improve. Many companies struggle to apply AI and fail to achieve the productivity improvements they seek. Executives often don’t make clear that they are using AI to help people increase productivity rather than to replace them. Treat AI adoption as an onboarding process that consists of four phases: AI as an assistant, as a monitor, as a coach, and as a teammate. In a 2018 Workforce Institute survey of  3,000 managers across eight industrialized nations, the majority of respondents described artificial intelligence as a valuable productivity tool.   It’s easy to see why: AI brings tangible benefits in processing speed, accuracy, and consistency (machines don’t make mistakes because they’re tired), which is why many professionals now rely on it. Some medical specialists, for example, use AI tools to help make diagnoses and decisions about treatment. But respondents to that survey also expressed fears that AI would take their jobs. They are not alone. The Guardian recently reported that more than 6 million workers in the UK fear being replaced by machines. These fears are echoed by academics and executives we meet at conferences and seminars. AI’s advantages can be cast in a much darker light: Why would humans be needed when machines can do a better job? The prevalence of such fears suggests that organizations looking to reap the benefits of AI need to be careful when introducing it to the people expected to work with it. Andrew Wilson, until January 2020 Accenture’s CIO, says, “The greater the degree of organizational focus on people helping AI, and AI helping people, the greater the value achieved.” Accenture has found that when companies make it clear that they are using AI to help people rather than to replace them, they significantly outperform companies that don’t set that objective (or are unclear about their AI goals) along most dimensions of managerial productivity—notably speed, scalability, and effectiveness of decision-making. In other words, just as when new talent joins a team, AI must be set up to succeed rather than to fail. A smart employer trains new hires by giving them simple tasks that build hands-on experience in a noncritical context and assigns them mentors to offer help and advice. This allows the newcomers to learn while others focus on higher-value tasks. As they gain experience and demonstrate that they can do the job, their mentors increasingly rely on them as sounding boards and entrust them with more-substantive decisions. Over time an apprentice becomes a partner, contributing skills and insight. Jean-Baptiste Perrot We believe this approach can work for artificial intelligence as well. In the following pages we draw on our own and others’ research and consulting on AI and information systems implementation, along with organizational studies of innovation and work practices, to present a four-phase approach to implementing AI. It allows enterprises to cultivate people’s trust—a key condition for adoption—and to work toward a distributed human-AI cognitive system in which people and AI both continually improve. Many organizations have experimented with phase 1, and some have progressed to phases 2 and 3. For now, phase 4 may be mostly a “future-casting” exercise of which we see some early signs, but it is feasible from a technological perspective and would provide more value to companies as they engage with artificial intelligence. This first phase of onboarding artificial intelligence is rather like the process of training an assistant. You teach the new employee a few fundamental rules and hand over some basic but time-consuming tasks you normally do (such as filing online forms or summarizing documents), which frees you to focus on more-important aspects of the job. The trainee learns by watching you, performing the tasks, and asking questions. One common task for AI assistants is sorting data. An example is the recommendation systems companies have used since the mid-1990s to help customers filter thousands of products and find the ones most relevant to them—Amazon and Netflix being among the leaders in this technology. More and more business decisions now require this type of data sorting. When, for example, portfolio managers are choosing stocks in which to invest, the information available is far more than a human can feasibly process, and new information comes out all the time, adding to the historical record. Software can make the task more manageable by immediately filtering stocks to meet predefined investment criteria. Natural-language processing, meanwhile, can identify the news most relevant to a company and even assess the general sentiment about an upcoming corporate event as reflected in analysts’ reports. Marble Bar Asset Management (MBAM), a London-based investment firm founded in 2002, is an early convert to using such technologies in the workplace. It has developed a state-of-the-art platform, called RAID (Research Analysis & Information Database), to help portfolio managers filter through high volumes of information about corporate events, news developments, and stock movements. AI is very helpful during high-volume decision-making, when humans may be tired. Another way AI can lend assistance is to model what a human might do. As anyone who uses Google will have noticed, prompts appear as a search phrase is typed in. Predictive text on a smartphone offers a similar way to speed up the process of typing. This kind of user modeling, related to what is sometimes called judgmental bootstrapping, was developed more than 30 years ago; it can easily be applied to decision-making. AI would use it to identify the choice an employee is most likely to make, given that employee’s past choices, and would suggest that choice as a starting point when the employee is faced with multiple decisions—speeding up, rather than actually doing, the job. Let’s look at this in a specific context. When airline employees are deciding how much food and drink to put on a given flight, they fill out catering orders, which involve a certain amount of calculation together with assumptions based on their experience of previous flights. Making the wrong choices incurs costs: Underordering risks upsetting customers who may avoid future travel on the airline. Overordering means the excess food will go to waste and the plane will have increased its fuel consumption unnecessarily. An algorithm can be very helpful in this context. AI can predict what the airline’s catering manager would order by analyzing his or her past choices or using rules set by the manager. This “autocomplete” of “recommended orders” can be customized for every flight using all relevant historical data, including food and drink consumption on the route in question and even past purchasing behavior by passengers on the manifest for that flight. But as with predictive typing, human users can freely overwrite as needed; they are always in the driver’s seat. AI simply assists them by imitating or anticipating their decision style. It should not be a stretch for managers to work with AI in this way. We already do so in our personal lives, when we allow the autocomplete function to prefill forms for us online. In the workplace a manager can, for example, define specific rules for an AI assistant to follow when completing forms. In fact, many software tools currently used in the workplace (such as credit-rating programs) are already just that: collections of human-defined decision rules. The AI assistant can refine the rules by codifying the circumstances under which the manager actually follows them. This learning needn’t involve any change in the manager’s behavior, let alone any effort to “teach” the assistant. The next step is to set up the AI system to provide real-time feedback. Thanks to machine-learning programs, AI can be trained to accurately forecast what a user’s decision would be in a given situation (absent lapses in rationality owing to, for example, overconfidence or fatigue). If a user is about to make a choice that is inconsistent with his or her choice history, the system can flag the discrepancy. This is especially helpful during high-volume decision-making, when human employees may be tired or distracted. Research in psychology, behavioral economics, and cognitive science shows that humans have limited and imperfect reasoning capabilities, especially when it comes to statistical and probabilistic problems, which are ubiquitous in business. Several studies (of which one of us, Chen, is a coauthor) concerning legal decisions found that judges grant political asylum more frequently before lunch than after, that they give lighter prison sentences if their NFL team won the previous day than if it lost, and that they will go easier on a defendant on the latter’s birthday. Clearly justice might be better served if human decision makers were assisted by software that told them when a decision they were planning to make was inconsistent with their prior decisions or with the decision that an analysis of purely legal variables would predict. AI can deliver that kind of input. Another study (also with Chen as a coauthor) showed that AI programs processing a model made up of basic legal variables (constructed by the study’s authors) can predict asylum decisions with roughly 80% accuracy on the date a case opens. The authors have added learning functionality to the program, which enables it to simulate the decision-making of an individual judge by drawing on that judge’s past decisions. The approach translates well to other contexts. For example, when portfolio managers (PMs) at Marble Bar Asset Management consider buy or sell decisions that may raise the overall portfolio risk—for example, by increasing exposure to a particular sector or geography—the system alerts them through a pop-up during a computerized transaction process so that they can adjust appropriately. A PM may ignore such feedback as long as company risk limits are observed. But in any case the feedback helps the PM reflect on his or her decisions. Of course AI is not always “right.” Often its suggestions don’t take into account some reliable private information to which the human decision maker has access, so the AI might steer an employee off course rather than simply correct for possible behavioral biases. That’s why using it should be like a dialogue, in which the algorithm provides nudges according to the data it has while the human teaches the AI by explaining why he or she overrode a particular nudge. This improves the AI’s usefulness and preserves the autonomy of the human decision maker. Unfortunately, many AI systems are set up to usurp that autonomy. Once an algorithm has flagged a bank transaction as possibly fraudulent, for example, employees are often unable to approve the transaction without clearing it with a supervisor or even an outside auditor. Sometimes undoing a machine’s choice is next to impossible—a persistent source of frustration for both customers and customer service professionals. In many cases the rationale for an AI choice is opaque, and employees are in no position to question that choice even when mistakes have been made. Of course AI is not always “right.” That’s why using it should be like a dialogue. Privacy is another big issue when machines collect data on the decisions people make. In addition to giving humans control in their exchanges with AI, we need to guarantee that any data it collects on them is kept confidential. A wall ought to separate the engineering team from management; otherwise employees may worry that if they freely interact with the system and make mistakes, they might later suffer for them. Also, companies should set rules about designing and interacting with AI to ensure organizational consistency in norms and practices. These rules might specify the level of predictive accuracy required to show a nudge or to offer a reason for one; criteria for the necessity of a nudge; and the conditions under which an employee should either follow the AI’s instruction or refer it to a superior rather than accept or reject it. To help employees retain their sense of control in phase 2, we advise managers and systems designers to involve them in design: Engage them as experts to define the data that will be used and to determine ground truth; familiarize them with models during development; and provide training and interaction as those models are deployed. In the process, employees will see how the models are built, how the data is managed, and why the machines make the recommendations they do. In a recent PwC survey nearly 60% of respondents said that they would like to get performance feedback on a daily or a weekly basis. It’s not hard to see why. As Peter Drucker asserted in his famous 2005 Harvard Business Review article “Managing Oneself,” people generally don’t know what they are good at. And when they think they do know, they are usually wrong. The trouble is that the only way to discover strengths and opportunities for improvement is through a careful analysis of key decisions and actions. That requires documenting expectations about outcomes and then, nine months to a year later, comparing those expectations with what actually happened. Thus the feedback employees get usually comes from hierarchical superiors during a review—not at a time or in a format of the recipient’s choosing. That is unfortunate, because, as Tessa West of New York University found in a recent neuroscience study, the more people feel that their autonomy is protected and that they are in control of the conversation—able to choose, for example, when feedback is given—the better they respond to it. AI could address this problem. The capabilities we’ve already mentioned could easily generate feedback for employees, enabling them to look at their own performance and reflect on variations and errors. A monthly summary analyzing data drawn from their past behavior might help them better understand their decision patterns and practices. A few companies, notably in the financial sector, are taking this approach. Portfolio managers at MBAM, for example, receive feedback from a data analytics system that captures investment decisions at the individual level. Jean-Baptiste Perrot The data can reveal interesting and varying biases among PMs. Some may be more loss-averse than others, holding on to underperforming investments longer than they should. Others may be overconfident, possibly taking on too large a position in a given investment. The analysis identifies these behaviors and—like a coach—provides personalized feedback that highlights behavioral changes over time, suggesting how to improve decisions. But it is up to the PMs to decide how to incorporate the feedback. MBAM’s leadership believes this “trading enhancement” is becoming a core differentiator that both helps develop portfolio managers and makes the organization more attractive. What’s more, just as a good mentor learns from the insights of the people who are being mentored, a machine-learning “coachbot” learns from the decisions of an empowered human employee. In the relationship we’ve described, a human can disagree with the coachbot—and that creates new data that will change the AI’s implicit model. For example, if a portfolio manager decides not to trade a highlighted stock because of recent company events, he or she can provide an explanation to the system. With feedback, the system continually captures data that can be analyzed to provide insights. If employees can relate to and control exchanges with artificial intelligence, they are more likely to see it as a safe channel for feedback that aims to help rather than to assess performance. Choosing the right interface is useful to this end. At MBAM, for example, trading enhancement tools—visuals, for instance—are personalized to reflect a PM’s preferences. As in phase 2, involving employees in designing the system is essential. When AI is a coach, people will be even more fearful of disempowerment. It can easily seem like a competitor as well as a partner—and who wants to feel less intelligent than a machine? Concerns about autonomy and privacy may be even stronger. Working with a coach requires honesty, and people may hesitate to be open with one that might share unflattering data with the folks in HR. Deploying AI in the ways described in the first three phases does of course have some downsides. Over the long term new technologies create more jobs than they destroy, but meanwhile labor markets may be painfully disrupted. What’s more, as Matt Beane argues in “Learning to Work with Intelligent Machines” (HBR, September–October 2019), companies that deploy AI can leave employees with fewer opportunities for hands-on learning and mentorship. When AI is a coach, it can easily seem like a competitor as well as a partner. There is some risk, therefore, not only of losing entry-level jobs (because digital assistants can effectively replace human ones) but also of compromising the ability of future decision makers to think for themselves. That’s not inevitable, however. As Beane suggests, companies could use their artificial intelligence to create different and better learning opportunities for their employees while improving the system by making it more transparent and giving employees more control. Because future entrants to the workforce will have grown up in a human-plus-machine workplace, they will almost certainly be faster than their pre-AI colleagues at spotting opportunities to innovate and introduce activities that add value and create jobs—which brings us to the final phase. Edwin Hutchins, a cognitive anthropologist, developed what is known as the theory of distributed cognition. It is based on his study of ship navigation, which, he showed, involved a combination of sailors, charts, rulers, compasses, and a plotting tool. The theory broadly relates to the concept of extended mind, which posits that cognitive processing, and associated mental acts such as belief and intention, are not necessarily limited to the brain, or even the body. External tools and instruments can, under the right conditions, play a role in cognitive processing and create what is known as a coupled system. In line with this thinking, in the final phase of the AI implementation journey (which to our knowledge no organization has yet adopted) companies would develop a coupled network of humans and machines in which both contribute expertise. We believe that as AI improves through its interactions with individual users, analyzing and even modeling expert users by drawing on data about their past decisions and behaviors, a community of experts (humans and machines) will naturally emerge in organizations that have fully integrated AI coachbots. For example, a purchasing manager who—with one click at the moment of decision—could see what price someone else would give could benefit from a customized collective of experts. Although the technology to create this kind of collective intelligence now exists, this phase is fraught with challenges. For example, any such integration of AI must avoid building in old or new biases and must respect human privacy concerns so that people can trust the AI as much as they would a human partner. That in itself is a pretty big challenge, given the volume of research demonstrating how hard it is to build trust among humans. The best approaches to building trust in the workplace rely on the relationship between trust and understanding—a subject of study by David Danks and colleagues at Carnegie Mellon. According to this model, I trust someone because I understand that person’s values, desires, and intentions, and they demonstrate that he or she has my best interests at heart. Although understanding has historically been a basis for building trust in human relationships, it is potentially well suited to cultivating human–AI partnerships as well, because employees’ fear of artificial intelligence is usually grounded in a lack of understanding of how AI works. In 2016 the investigative newsroom ProPublica published an exposé of a risk-prediction AI program known as COMPAS, which judges in southern Florida use to determine a defendant’s likelihood of re-offending within a specified time period. The algorithm underlying COMPAS is held as a trade secret by its manufacturer, Northpointe (now Equivant), which means that we don’t know how COMPAS generates its predictions, nor do we have access to the data the algorithm is trained on—so we cannot even inquire into its rationale. When it was reported that the algorithm produces disparate outcomes across race, COMPAS immediately became a leading example of why people cannot trust AI. If businesses want employees to adopt, use, and ultimately trust AI systems, it will be important to open up the black box—to the extent legally possible—to those who are expected to engage with the technology. As Richard Socher, the chief scientist at Salesforce, puts it, “If businesses use AI to make predictions, they owe humans an explanation as to how the decisions are made.” In building understanding, a particular challenge is defining what “explanation” means—let alone “good explanation.” This challenge is the focus of a lot of research. For example, one of us (Evgeniou) is working to open up machine-learning “black boxes” by means of so-called counterfactual explanations. A counterfactual explanation illuminates a particular decision of an AI system (for example, to approve credit for a given transaction) by identifying a short list of transaction characteristics that drove the decision one way or another. Had any of the characteristics been different (or counter to the fact), the system would have made a different decision (credit would have been denied). Evgeniou is also exploring what people perceive as good explanations for AI decisions. For example, do they see an explanation as better when it’s presented in terms of a logical combination of features (“The transaction was approved because it had X,Y,Z characteristics”) or when it’s presented relative to other decisions (“The transaction was approved because it looks like other approved transactions, and here they are for you to see”)? As research into what makes AI explainable continues, AI systems should become more transparent, thus facilitating trust.  Adopting new technologies has always been a major challenge—and the more impact a technology has, the bigger the challenge is. Because of its potential impact, artificial intelligence may be perceived as particularly difficult to implement. Yet if done mindfully, adoption can be fairly smooth. That is precisely why companies must ensure that AI’s design and development are responsible—especially with regard to transparency, decision autonomy, and privacy—and that it engages the people who will be working with it. Otherwise they will quite reasonably fear being constrained—or even replaced—by machines that are making all sorts of decisions in ways they don’t understand. Getting past these fears to create a trusting relationship with AI is key. In all four phases described in these pages, humans determine the ground rules. With a responsible design, AI may become a true partner in the workplace—rapidly processing large volumes of varied data in a consistent manner to enhance the intuition and creativity of humans, who in turn teach the machine.

"158",158,"https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation","technology.txt","Tesla has shifted the auto industry toward electric vehicles, achieved consistently growing revenues, and at the start of 2020 was the highest performing automaker, in terms of total return, sales growth and long-term shareholder value. As a technology and innovation scholar, the author has studied how innovators commercialize new technologies and found that Tesla’s strategy offers enduring lessons for any innovator, especially in terms of how to win support for an idea and how to bring new technologies to market. To understand Tesla’s strategy, one must separate its two primary pillars: headline-grabbing moves like launching the Cybertruck or the Roadster 2.0 and the big bets it is making on its core vehicles, the models S, X, 3, and Y. Few companies have attracted as much scorn and adoration as Tesla. When Tesla launches a product like the Cybertruck, the reception tends to be divisive: critics see it as further evidence that founder Elon Musk is out of touch and doomed to fail, while supporters buy in — within a month Tesla received 200,000 preorders for the new vehicle. Compare that to the Ford-150, the world’s best-selling car in 2018, which sold just over 1 million vehicles that year. Disagreements aside, there is no question that the company has shifted the auto industry toward electric vehicles and achieved consistently growing revenues (passing $20 billion in 2019). At the start of 2020, Tesla was the highest performing automaker in terms of total return, sales growth and long-term shareholder value. Surely, there is a method to what seems like madness to so many. As technology and innovation scholars, we’ve studied how innovators commercialize new technologies and we’ve interviewed Elon Musk, his co-founder J.B. Straubel, and other important members of the team. What we’ve found is that beneath the turbulent surface, Tesla’s innovation strategy — which focuses on transforming the auto industry as a whole — offers enduring lessons for any innovator, especially in terms of how to win support for an idea and how to bring new technologies to market. To understand Tesla’s strategy, one must first separate its two primary pillars: headline-grabbing moves like launching the Cybertruck or the Roadster 2.0 (which the company claims will accelerate faster than any production car ever made) and the big bets it is making on its core vehicles, the models S, X, 3, and Y. These efforts aim to achieve different things — winning the resources to commercialize vs. actually commercializing the idea — but they come together to achieve a central goal: bring a new innovation to market. Let’s start with the first part of the strategy. In our view, efforts like the Cybertruck aren’t really about making money; they are about getting attention and proving that Tesla is one of the world’s most innovative companies, specifically for the purpose of building Tesla’s ability to win support from stakeholders — what we call innovation capital. In our work reviewing academic research, interviewing over 100 innovators, and conducting both quantitative and qualitative analysis of innovative companies, we’ve explored how innovators build up their innovation capital. Innovation capital consists of four factors: Based on our case study of Tesla, we’ve observed that Elon Musk is a master of building and using innovation capital to win support for his ideas. Not only does he leverage his past success at Paypal and Space X to win support for future projects, he also uses what we call “impression amplifiers” to get stakeholders on board. For example, when Musk stands on stage and reveals the Cybertruck, he doesn’t just talk about the new idea, he materializes it, putting it into physical form to convince skeptics (he also did this when he parked a Space X rocket in front of the National Air and Space Museum). He also broadcasts the idea through big media launches like the demo for the Cybertruck, which gets third parties talking about the company and generating buzz. Similarly, when Musk tweets to his 29 million followers that a “Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters,” he probably isn’t serious when he says that “Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly.” But he is creating a positive impression for Tesla by leveraging another impression amplifier: comparing, or drawing a connection between his innovation and some other successful one. This comparison creates an impression between the technical superiority of a Tesla and … rocket science, literally. These techniques aim to build Musk and Tesla’s innovation capital so they can continue to win support from investors, customers, and employees to keep Tesla operating. What about the other part of Tesla’s strategy: the existing vehicles — the model S, 3, X and Y — which form the core products and require the most investment? These big bets aim to transform an industry, and they require paying attention not just to the product, but to the entire product ecosystem. What makes this part of the strategy truly unique is not just that Tesla produces electric vehicles, but that it introduced a new hardware and software architecture (the way you put the car together). For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla’s ability to update software and optimize vehicle performance. Tesla’s hardware architecture — a flat pack of batteries at the base, two electric engines (front and rear), no transmission, etc. —also gives it an advantage over competing electric vehicles built on traditional vehicle architectures, such as a lower center of gravity, greater energy density, and more efficient battery management. This means that pound-for-pound, Tesla tends to beat out competitors who try to leverage parts of the old internal combustion vehicle architecture, for example, by putting batteries in the trunk rather than in a flat pack at the bottom. On the surface, building a new architecture may seem an easy strategy to imitate, but prior research shows it can be very difficult: it can take time and effort for incumbents since it often requires abandoning old ways of doing things and developing new capabilities. In the words of a senior auto executive I interviewed, “It’s just hard for us because historically we have been great mechanical engineers, not great software engineers. But we need to become software engineers.” Tesla’s ecosystem strategy also considers the level of individual components for its products. Why? We know from past research that the profits in an industry tend to flow to the bottlenecks — the components that limit the performance of the system. In the case of electric cars, even though batteries are made of commodity materials, because their power capacity limits the performance of most applications, especially cars, they are a bottleneck to the performance of the whole system. By investing in batteries —producing them at scale and in better ways — Tesla is betting that they will control the bottleneck, and thus the profit center, for the future of the industry. Tesla’s strategy also accounts for the system level: the entire set of complements needed for a consumer to use its product. This is why Tesla has built out a charging network for its cars across the country. Acting early enabled Tesla to be the only electric car that could drive long distances because there was an infrastructure in place for charging. In the future, this advantage may erode if other auto makers build charging networks and piggyback off their existing dealership networks to potentially offer more convenient service. But for now, Tesla has the advantage and looks to be extending it by creating inter-operability with new networks like EVgo. Regardless of your views of Tesla’s future success, the company has developed a fascinating multi-pronged strategy for fundamentally changing an industry. The core strategy has unique elements at each level of the ecosystem: overturning the core product architecture, positioning themselves in key bottleneck components, and resolving system-level limitations that slow the adoption of the technology. At the same time, they have applied an effective approach to build their innovation capital so they can win the resources and support to execute on their vision. Investors are seeing the potential of Tesla’s future as the company’s market value now exceeds the combined market value of GM, Ford and FiatChrysler. Innovators should take note. Editor’s Note (2/18) – This article has been updated to clarify the definition of innovation capital."
"159",159,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/its-time-for-a-new-kind-of-electronic-health-record","technology.txt","Well before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, electronic health records were the bane of physicians’ existences. In all too many cases, EHRs seemed to create a huge amount of extra work and generate too few benefits. The pandemic has made the deficiencies of these systems glaringly apparent. This article discusses how EHRs should be transformed so they become an indispensable tool in keeping individual patients and patient populations healthy. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. The Covid-19 pandemic presents the U.S. health care system with a mind-boggling array of challenges. One of the most urgent is coping with a simultaneous glut and dearth of information. Between tracking outbreaks, staying abreast of the latest information on effective treatments and vaccine development, keeping tabs on how each patient is doing, and recognizing and documenting a seemingly endless stream of weird new symptoms, the entire medical community is being chronically overwhelmed. Sorting through large amounts of information and finding the nuggets that apply to a particular patient’s situation is something that computers ought to be good at. But we still have problems of knowing what data is important and what is the right treatment and prevention plan for each patient. During the Obama administration, the federal government supplied billions of dollars — and providers kicked in billions more — to speed the adoption of electronic health records. But even though up to 96% of hospitals and 86% of physician offices have adopted them, we still don’t have EHRs that can rise to the information challenges that clinicians face every day, let alone those posed by Covid-19. Providers still encounter continual frustration on many levels: user interfaces and usability issues, the quality of the data entered, the limited ability of the data to support discovery and interoperability among systems, just to name a few. These limitations have confounded the ability of clinicians to deliver care during the Covid-19 crisis. An overhaul of the electronic health record is overdue. It must go beyond fixing the user interface or improving interoperability. It must address the fundamental problems exposed by the pandemic. The overhaul must also support the ability of providers to adopt the new value-based-care business model of health care — one that rewards providers for outcomes rather than the volume of services and that shifts their focus from reactive sick care to the proactive management of health. To address these needs, the electronic health record must transition from an emphasis on a person’s medical record to an emphasis on a person’s plan for health and from a focus on supporting clinical transactions to a focus on delivering information to the provider and the patient. A redesign of the EHR is essential, but what should it look like? EHRs are reasonably good at the “record” part — keeping track of what happened to the patient — but they must evolve to address the “health” part by helping providers plan for what they want to happen. EHRs could become tools for making those plans and keeping them on track if we design them with that goal in mind. Intermountain Healthcare, Virginia Mason, and Kaiser Permanente are pioneers in adopting the new health care business model. Their experiences point the way to the next generation of EHRs. What would a “plan-centric” EHR system look like? It would include: Imagine a plan-centric EHR ready to deal with Covid-19, incorporating the latest evidence-based treatments into each patient’s care plan based on their current status and underlying health conditions, and then feeding back data on how each patient responded in order to improve the plan for the next patient. Such capabilities could transform outcomes and save many lives. As befits systems with origins in billing, the design focus of EHRs has been transactional: documenting a visit, retrieving a lab result, sending a prescription to the pharmacy. This focus is not all bad: It has reduced some types of errors and made it easier to generate work lists and logic to help ensure that the clinical order is complete. However, exquisite transaction support is not enough to address the challenges that afflict care delivery: failure to follow the evidence, brittle operational and clinical processes, and the near impossibility of keeping up with advances in medicine. EHRs can compound these limitations by being very difficult to update. We must reimagine the EHR not as a document but as a system that supports the generation and tracking of multiple documents, events, and processes. It must surround each transaction and clinical process with intelligence to ensure clinical appropriateness and sound execution. It should help ensure that care follows the evidence, identify treatment options that result from the dazzling pace of medical discovery, and alert providers that care processes have deviated from acceptable levels of performance. This intelligence must detect acts of commission (the choice of an outdated treatment approach) and omission (a patient has failed to keep an appointment to see a specialist). The EHR must provide the ability for clinicians to easily analyze patient data to discover new treatments, uncover safety issues, and identify unusual clinical findings. Such capabilities would have enabled, for example, the much faster discovery of blood clotting in Covid-19 patients. Intelligence can be leveraged to help address clinician concerns with EHR usability. Logic that presents the physician with data and potential actions tailored to reflect the patient’s conditions, the physician’s preferences, and the medical evidence can save the physician time and improve the quality of care. Many of these intelligence and plan capabilities are present to some degree in today’s EHR. However, the old fee-for-service business model has not rewarded their refinement and extensive use. Some providers — including Kaiser Permanente, Geisinger, Intermountain Healthcare, and UPMC — are using their EHRs in this way, but these organizations share a key characteristic: They insure a significant percentage of their patients as well as providing their care, and therefore their financial incentives are more like those of payers. They have already embraced the new value-based-care business model that the rest of the industry is moving toward. We will always need medical record documentation and transaction capabilities. An accurate, comprehensive health record is critical to the delivery of care and is also a required legal document. How can we preserve these functions of the EHR while migrating it to the new intelligent, plan-centric design? One major obstacle to fixing the EHR problem is that the health care industry is in the middle of a transition to the new business model. But the change is happening so gradually — in fits and starts, depending on the payer and the political environment — that it’s difficult for providers and EHR vendors alike to gauge the appropriate moment for a system redesign. Consequently, providers will have to juggle two opposing business models for an unknown period of time, and their information technology portfolio will have to support both. Exasperated users might support the idea of tossing out what we have and starting over from scratch, but that’s not going to happen for a number of reasons: the stupefyingly large cost, the enormous development and implementation time, the disruption of operations, and the potential danger to patients during the transition. Health care should take a lesson from banking. Instead of rewriting legacy systems, the banking community modified current systems, added complementary applications, and “wrapped” legacy systems with newer technologies and capabilities. To transform the EHR from a (quasi) document into the new design, we need a full array of complementary applications that “wrap around” appropriately modified EHRs and provide significant care-plan and intelligence support. Providers can make these investments as needed to match the pace and address the specific needs of their migration to value-based care and measure the return on investment as they go. These applications and capabilities might include the following: Many health systems have begun to adopt the strategy of surrounding their EHRs with the next generation of intelligent, plan-centric capabilities. As the health care business model evolves, organizations such as Mass General Brigham (formerly Partners HealthCare), Memorial Hermann, Geisinger, CommonSpirit Health, and Cedars Sinai are vigorously implementing population health, big data analytics, and patient-health-management applications. Health care delivery is in the early stages of an extraordinary change. This change is being driven by the relentless movement to the value-based care model and the problems exposed by the Covid-19 crisis. This ongoing transformation is paving the way for a new EHR design: a platform that fuses the current EHR with complementary systems, capabilities, and technologies. Achieving the intelligent, plan-centric health care platform will require a level of industry cooperation that is unlike, and in some ways antithetical to, the way we’ve always done things. The pandemic has shown us health care collaboration at its best. In that respect, the response to the pandemic mirrors the new business model that we are trying to build.

"160",160,"https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-tesla-sets-itself-apart","technology.txt","Tesla and its flamboyant, and sometimes erratic, innovator Elon Musk have turned the more than a century old industry upside down in a mere 16 years. Traditional automakers are ill prepared to compete in today’s software-centered world. Unlike nimble Tesla, they are big, bureaucratic, slow to respond to customers, dependent on providing customer financing for unit sales growth, and culturally different from a software company. Tesla’s speed in innovation in the market for high-end vehicles is more like a Google or an Amazon than an automaker. And its soaring market valuation is a clear sign to all automakers that they’ll need to develop more innovative, Tesla-like business models in order to survive.  Tesla’s recent breakout market performance is proving some of its skeptics wrong. By mid-January, Tesla’s market capitalization had reached $107 billion, and it surged past the giant German automaker Volkswagen to become the world’s second most valuable auto company behind Toyota. Tesla’s valuation now exceeds that of Ford and GM combined.The Wall Street doubters may be in shock, but I’m not. Full disclosure, I own two Teslas and I own stock in the company. But it’s my experience as a three-time software company CEO that makes it increasingly clear to me that the company’s innovative business model represents an existential threat to the auto industry as a whole.How so?“Software is eating the world,” Marc Andreessen, co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in a memorable 2011 essay. And software is a big part of Tesla’s advantage. In my view, the traditional automakers are ill prepared to compete in today’s software-centered world. Unlike nimble Tesla, they are big, bureaucratic, slow to respond to customers, dependent on providing customer financing for unit sales growth, and culturally different from a software company. And they know it. Last fall, the chairman of Volkswagen — still reeling from its auto-emission scandal — declared Tesla a “serious competitor.” The biggest challenge VW and other leading automakers face is that they lack the expertise required to compete in the age of the software car.  Tesla and its flamboyant, and sometimes erratic, innovator Elon Musk have turned the more than a century old industry upside down in a mere 16 years. How could the disruption have happened so quickly? The answer begins by looking at how the world’s traditional auto leaders got where they are today. What started as a fragmented market of some 200 car makers in the early 1920s gradually consolidated into a few behemoths who erected enormous, capital-intensive barriers to entry that they assumed to be unassailable. Tesla’s speed in innovation in the market for high-end vehicles is more like a Google or an Amazon than an automaker. And its soaring market valuation is a clear sign to all automakers that they’ll need to develop more innovative, Tesla-like business models in order to survive. As I see it, Tesla currently does at least four things better than all the auto makers: Tesla builds cars by developing software on unique hardware, much in the way Apple develops the iPhone or Microsoft leverages Intel chips and Dell PCs.  This enables the company to improve its cars’ software functionality every few weeks. This is in sharp contrast to the traditional auto industry model where the product is the same for as long as you drive it. With fewer parts, the total cost of Tesla ownership is significantly lower than an internal combustion vehicle. There’s no need for expensive oil changes, tune ups, replacing mufflers, and the like. The automakers, who derive significant profitability from their service businesses, know this. Tesla doesn’t advertise in the Sunday newspaper or put ads on the radio. Instead is uses the classic software “inbound” sales model: They know consumers are smart and will find them. They understand the buyers’ journey very well. Buying a Tesla is relatively simple: You go online, pick a model, add your features, place your deposit, and schedule pickup. Done. The last time I bought a car from a well-known Japanese automaker, the buying process was miserable from start to finish. I had to talk to a sales rep who would not give me a straight price and kept scurrying back to a manager, who wrote down successive new numbers before we came to a deal. When I picked up the car, the salesperson begged me to give him a 10 on the Net Promoter Score survey so he could get his bonus. I much prefer controlling the experience myself. Tesla’s battery-powered vehicles are significantly simpler than their internal combustion competitors. By some estimates they have significantly fewer parts per vehicle — around 20 — versus the 2,000 in internal combustion engines. This simplicity dramatically reduces the consumers total cost of ownership. Tesla has recently acquired battery manufacturing companies and will incorporate new kinds of battery-related technologies into its vehicles, which could further reduce cost of ownership. While other automakers are also rushing to acquire the right electric battery expertise, they will still be playing catch up as this market grows. From a marketing point of view, Tesla already has a big advantage in some categories. Who wouldn’t want to own a car that creates no pollution, eliminates visits to gas stations, and is truly green?  Other automakers are going to be playing catch up on this issue for a long time. Given this situation, what is the auto industry to do? Traditional car makers will be offering a growing range of electric vehicles in 2020 — but they aren’t necessarily software cars. They are often the cars you’re used to, fitted with electric motors. To be sure, there are security risks with software cars, as with any kind of connectivity. But Tesla could expand its leadership role by modeling how to manage those risks effectively. Traditional automakers must now imagine how to become software companies, which, given how far behind they are, means they will have to do what legacy software companies do when startups disrupt their core markets — they buy competitors to consolidate the market. We should watch for this activity, because it is likely about to start in earnest."
"161",161,"https://hbr.org/2020/05/digital-transformation-comes-down-to-talent-in-4-key-areas","technology.txt","Digital transformation requires talent. Assembling the right team of people in four domains — technology, data, process people, and organizational change capacity — may be the single most important step that a company contemplating digital transformation can take. Each of these areas require a certain set of skills. In the technology domain, you need people with technological depth and breadth, and the ability to work hand-in-hand with the business. Leaders of the technology domain must be great communicators, and they must have strategic sense. You’ll need this same breadth and depth in the next domain: data. You also need the ability to convince large numbers of people at the front lines of organizations to take on new roles as data customers and data creators. When considering the next domain, process, look for the ability to “herd cats” – to align silos and to know when incremental process improvement is sufficient or when radical process reengineering is necessary. Finally, for organizational change capability, look for leadership, teamwork, courage, emotional intelligence, and other elements of change management. Over the years we’ve participated in, advised on, or studied hundreds of digital transformations. In doing so, we’ve gained a perspective on just how difficult true digital transformation really is and what it takes to succeed. Digital transformation is not for the faint of heart — the unfortunate reality is that, to date, many such efforts, like transformation programs in general, have failed. Success requires bringing together and coordinating a far greater range of effort than most leaders appreciate. A poor showing in any one of four inter-related domains — technology, data, process, or organizational change capability — can scuttle an otherwise well-conceived transformation. The really important stuff, from creating and communicating a compelling vision, to crafting a plan and adjusting it on the fly, to slogging through the details, is all about people. More than anything else, digital transformation requires talent. Indeed, assembling the right team of technology, data, and process people who can work together — with a strong leader who can bring about change — may be the single most important step that a company contemplating digital transformation can take. Of course, even the best talent does not guarantee success. But a lack of it almost guarantees failure. Let’s explore the talent needed in each of the four domains in turn. From the Internet of Things, to blockchain, to data lakes, to artificial intelligence, the raw potential of emerging technologies is staggering. And while many of these are becoming easier to use, understanding how any particular technology contributes to transformational opportunity, adapting that technology to the specific needs of the business, and integrating it with existing systems is extremely complex. Complicating matters, most companies have enormous technical debt — embedded legacy technologies that are difficult to change. You can only resolve these issues with people who have technological depth and breadth, and the ability to work hand-in-hand with the business. Challenging as these difficulties are, an even more critical issue is that many business people have lost faith in their IT department’s ability to drive major change, as many IT functions are primarily focused on “keeping the lights on.” Eventually, however, digital transformation must incorporate institutional IT, so rebuilding trust is essential. This means that technologists must provide, and demonstrate, business value with every technology innovation. Thus, leaders of the technology domain must be great communicators, and they must have the strategic sense to make technological choices that balance innovation and dealing with technical debt. The unfortunate reality is that at many companies today most data is not up to basic standards, and the rigors of transformation require much better data quality and analytics. Transformation almost certainly involves understanding new types of unstructured data (e.g., a driver-supplied picture of damage to a car), massive quantities of data external to your company, leveraging proprietary data, and integrating everything together, all while shedding enormous quantities of data that have never been (and never will be) used. Data presents an interesting paradox: Most companies know data is important and they know quality is bad, yet they waste enormous resources by failing to put the proper roles and responsibilities in place. They often blame their IT functions for all these failures. As with technology, you need talent with both great breadth and depth in data. Even more important is the ability to convince large numbers of people at the front lines of organizations to take on new roles as data customers and data creators. This means thinking through and communicating the data they need now and the data they’ll need after transformation. It also means helping front-line workers to improve their own work processes and tasks such that they create data correctly. Transformation requires an end-to-end mindset, a rethinking of ways to meet customer needs, seamless connection of work activities, and the ability to manage across silos going forward. A process orientation is a natural fit with these needs. But many have found process management — horizontally, across silos, and focused on customers — difficult to reconcile with traditional hierarchical thinking. As a result, this powerful concept has languished. Without it, transformation is reduced to a series of incremental improvements — important and helpful, but not truly transformative. In building talent in this domain look for the ability to “herd cats” — aligning silos in the direction of the customer to improve existing processes and design new ones, and a strategic sense to know when incremental process improvement is sufficient and when radical process reengineering is necessary. In this domain we include leadership, teamwork, courage, emotional intelligence, and other elements of change management. Fortunately, much has been written about this domain for many years, so we won’t review it here, other than to note that anyone responsible for digital transformation must be well-versed in the area. While, we have no firm evidence to support this, it seems that those who gravitate toward technology, data, and process are somewhat less likely to embrace the human side of change. Of course, in our recommendations above, we have urged leaders to seek those with excellent people skills. If you are unable to find them, a good alternative is to put some “purple people,” those able to work on both sides, on the transformation team. So far, we’ve discussed the technology, data, process, and organizational change capability domains as if they existed in isolation, which of course they don’t. Rather, they are part of a larger whole. Technology is the engine of digital transformation, data is the fuel, process is the guidance system, and organizational change capability is the landing gear. You need them all, and they must function well together. Consider the “our systems don’t talk” problem, which bedevils most companies and is anathema to digital transformation. But in which domain does it belong? As described above, it is a tech problem — but it also leads to enormous process inefficiencies. Yet it stems from a lack of solid data architecture, and it may involve organizational structure and politics issues that are difficult to change. So one could argue that any domain should take the lead. But the best solution involves the four working together. Absent a deep understanding of each domain, it is difficult for nearly all business leaders to see the full potential in digital transformation — a contributing factor to many failed digital transformations. But of course, no one individual possesses all the required knowledge and capability. Hence our call to assemble talent in each area. Finally, work on technology, data, and process must proceed in an appropriate sequence. It is generally accepted that there is no sense automating a process that doesn’t work, so in many cases, process improvement or reengineering must come first. On the other hand, some transformations will feature large doses of artificial intelligence. Since bad data stymies development and deployment of good AI models, in these cases, work on data should come first. Start with your end goals, then develop the sequence of steps best suited to achieving them Digital transformation can and should be focused on problems of greatest need to the company. Those priorities will also lend a flavor to the talent needed; if the focus is on transforming customer relationships, for example, the data talent on the team may have particular expertise in customer data, the process talent on sales and marketing processes, and so forth. More important, however, is that the talent possesses the four types of expertise we have described and has had previous success at creating and executing on any kind of technology-driven transformation."

The key is to form a “parenting posse,” group of people to serve as backup and support for a specific set of needs. But finding these people can be hard to difficult, especially when the pandemic comes into play. Fortunately, there are ways to create this support system. First, make a list of your top three to five pain points, then, figure out the best people that can help you. Third, define a clear system to get the help you need. Finally, if necessary, explore bigger changes — even if that includes a move to get the support you need. The beginning of this year was a particularly hectic one for my family. From January to March, I would fly to San Francisco every week to participate in a Y Combinator batch. It was a critical opportunity for building the digital tool I’m working on, but it also meant added complexity at home, with a husband building his own company and two kids in second grade and kindergarten, respectively. We had my parents as backup, but with so much going on, we knew we needed more. I reached out to some of the parents of my daughter’s friends, told them the situation, and asked if they would be able to help with some pickups or drop-offs at the school, should we need them. They readily agreed, so for two months, when things inevitably got sticky, we had a “parenting posse” to lean on — a group of people that I had an explicit agreement with, to serve as backup and support for a specific set of needs. Then Covid hit, and everyone’s lives were turned upside down. Determined to keep some level of posse going, I reached out to see if these same parents wanted to create a virtual “pod” every morning for the girls to do a math worksheet, spelling, or even just color for half an hour. Parents took turns leading, giving everyone welcome structure and community in that time. I think often about how grateful I was to have that group — both in “normal” times and not. The needs were drastically different, but the intent was the same: to share the load of everyday parenting. It’s a concept that Alison Beard also elaborated on in her piece, “Working Parents Need a ‘Parenting Posse.’” It’s a topic that is near and dear to my heart — both in my life and also in my work. For the past five years, I’ve been dedicated to figuring out why the support parents have today is stuck in the last century, when the traditional definition of a family dominated, a breadwinner brought in a “family wage” and a homemaker ran everything to do with the family, from child care to socializing. Second, I wanted to know how we can build 21st-century support instead — the tools and the services that reflect the realities of today’s families, whether they contain two working parents, single parents, jobs with variable work schedules, or other complex logistics. In this journey, I’ve thought long and hard about what it is that actually moves the needle in lightening that weight that rests on their shoulders. Turns out, it’s a matter of basic physics: Distribute the weight over many shoulders. Of course, those shoulders can be hard to come by. More and more, we live in different cities than our parents and communities of our youth. And if it was difficult to find them pre-pandemic, it’s nearly impossible now. We used to be worried about the regular-flavor complexity of finding the right people, fighting the feeling of imposing on them, and navigating the tricky conversations that lead to clear expectations. But with Covid? Now we’re worried about health risks, different tolerances, and unseen burdens. So how do you find and form a parenting posse? Whether you’re navigating remote school while working from home or need a last-minute pickup from soccer practice, here are ways to create this support system. What are the hardest parts of your week, the proverbial straws threatening to break the camel’s back? Is it needing short blocks of child care (for key appointments, critical breaks, or important meetings), handling draining bedtimes, covering the never-ending meals (and cleanup), or dealing with feelings of isolation, lack of personal time, and little sleep? Brainstorm a list. You might discover that your list is really long, so focus on the ones that will make the biggest impact. Narrow it down to the top three to five pain points, ones that others could realistically and practically help with, without a lot of context or risk. With the most important needs in mind, make a list of all the people that could be helpful in some way. The easiest to think of will be other parents — from your kids’ school, extracurricular activities, place of worship, neighborhood, etc. But while they certainly know the job and can help, they’re also likely dealing with their own chaos. So don’t be shy about expanding beyond other parents. Are there friends or coworkers without kids, an 18-year-old neighbor attending college from home, or a retiree with a bit of extra time on their hands? Think expansively. When pushed, you’ll be surprised at just how many people you do have in your world that are willing and able to help, especially with short, targeted requests. Don’t know a lot of people or new to your community? Find a contact sheet from your child’s school or other activities. Send out an email and suggest a video happy hour. It’ll be a slower build but hopefully you’ll connect with a couple of people you can form a relationship with. Our eldest started at a new school this year, and we’re taking this approach, so we can meet other parents that we would otherwise be running into at pickups and drop-offs. (This approach also works if you find that you don’t have time to attend in-person meet-and-greets, even when they’re offered.) If you’re still having trouble, choose quality over quantity. Here are four options of what your posse might look like and how it might be structured. Use them as a starting point to customize to your specific needs: These are just a few ways you might explore finding and building your parenting posse — both in person and virtually. But if this isn’t enough, go bigger. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that we need to be brutally honest about our priorities. That prioritization might now include either moving to be closer to family (or bring family to you) or relocating to a city or region where you can get more of the support you need. It’s certainly not something to be done lightly and has a myriad of logistics puzzle pieces to think through (including if your workplace is amenable to the move), but it’s been a life-changing move for those that have already done it and should be an option to consider. As I find myself saying often: There are no good choices right now. There is only a series of “doing our best.” Finding people that help you get through Covid and beyond is no different. Try one approach or try them all. See what works best for your family and the ever-changing times. Parenting has never been a more constant and heavy weight. But with some creative teamwork, it’s a challenge that can be weathered, posse in tow. Avni Patel Thompson is the founder and CEO of Modern Village.

But the more we can all learn to laugh about these moments, the less awkward they’ll be. Here are a few moments you may encounter while working from home. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. At my first job out of college, my coworker and I would often fight over the title of “most awkward person in the office.” I know it doesn’t seem like a title you would want, but it was our way of coping with the inevitable feelings of social awkwardness that we all experience at work sometimes — you know, waving to a colleague who is waving to the colleague behind you, or having to jog for the door because your boss waits, holding it, a whole 30 feet ahead. As an introvert and generally anxious person, it seems like this kind of stuff happens to me a lot. Which is why, back then, it felt nice to acknowledge — and even celebrate — it a little. It’s become one way for me to connect with others because I’ve realized just how universal these experiences and feelings are. Now, with virtual work being the “new normal,” these awkward encounters have taken on a “new normal” of their own. We’ve had to re-learn how to communicate with each other. Our coworkers are getting an actual window into our lives. With that can come some pretty interesting moments. So let’s talk about that: It’s been kind of weird. That’s okay. Acknowledging, embracing and celebrating it will only bring us closer together. And in this socially distant world, that’s something that we need right now. After all, these things happen to everyone, right? Right?  The rules that apply to office attire just aren’t the same in the virtual world. Yes, you need to be professional — especially if you’re giving a big presentation or something. But, listen, I have a favorite sweater, and I’m not going to be shy about that. Until someone points out that I’ve worn it every day this week. Oops. I swear, I did laundry on Wednesday.  Speaking of questionable fashion choices … I don’t think I’ve worn real pants since March. I’m a strictly yoga pants kind of person these days (sorry not sorry). On the off occasion that I do have an important meeting or presentation, I’ll cave and swap out my favorite sweater for one of the forgotten blazers in my closet. But you better believe those yoga pants are staying on. Who is going to notice, right?  It’s impossible to avoid talking over each other in virtual meetings. You’ve got glitchy WiFi, pesky mute buttons, hard-to-read body language — it’s the perfect storm. So why does it still feel so terrible and awkward every time it happens? Can we all just collectively agree that this is fine? And that as long as we respect each other, this doesn’t have to be awkward anymore? Cool? Cool.  I (unfortunately) don’t have any pets. So for me, someone’s dog or cat popping into frame during a meeting gives me that little boost of serotonin I need to get through my day. But for the pet owner, I imagine the interruption isn’t always welcome — especially if it’s a brand new puppy who accidentally has an accident on their lap, which may or may not have happened to one of my colleagues last week on Zoom. Think about it this way: They’re just trying to help you get your work done faster so you can get back to cuddles.  If you started a new job remotely in the past few months (or ever really), this one’s for you. (And I’m right here with ya.) Regardless, I’m sure you can relate to the awkwardness that comes with laughing along to a joke you don’t understand. That’s kind of what it feels like to pretend you know what your coworkers are talking about when they mention the coveted office. I’ve heard beautiful stories about book-lined walls, ping pong tournaments, and cupcake-fueled meetings. But for now, all I can do is smile wistfully and hope that no one can tell I’m totally faking it."

"165",165,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-to-defeat-busy-culture","work life.txt","At home and at work, busy culture worsens the problems it promises to solve. We think that the busier we are, the bigger impact we’ll be able to make. But in reality, busy culture destroys productivity, while pulling us away from our families and coworkers alike. What can leaders do to dismantle a toxic culture of busyness? In this piece, the author shares three strategies to encourage healthier work-life boundaries, including instituting financial incentives for disconnecting from work, modeling focus on your primary goal, and leaning on peers within the organization to support a more positive company culture. At home and at work, “busy” culture worsens the problems it promises to solve. It’s natural to assume that the busier we are, the bigger the impact we’ll be able to make — but in reality, studies have shown that busy culture destroys productivity and pulls us away from both our families and deeper relationships with our coworkers. Like all work cultures, busy culture starts at the top, with leaders who want to appear successful, important, and productive. But what makes it so tough to overcome is that it also has roots at the bottom, where junior employees compete to stand out as hard workers eager to contribute and move up. And then, of course, there’s the problem of how porous our work-life boundaries have become, thanks to the proliferation of technologies that make it possible to work and connect with one another from anywhere, at any time. So what can leaders do to combat a toxic culture of busyness? There’s no easy answer, but here are three strategies that can help: Incentivize boundary-setting. Busy culture has to be fought with unquestionable company commitment. Praising employees and awarding them extra time off is a good start, but those measures can often come across as token gestures. What works better, it turns out, is paying people to be less busy. That may sound radical, but paying people to work less is an appropriate solution for what has become a serious problem. More than four-fifths of employees send work emails on weekends. Nearly six in 10 do so while on vacation, and more than half check email after 11 PM. These are problematic behaviors if you’re worried about the health, satisfaction, and productivity of your employees. The good news is, they’re also behaviors that managers can easily track and use to promote boundary-setting. One tech company, FullContact, has been doing this for years. Employees can earn a $7,500 annual vacation stipend by following three simple rules: No checking work messages, no working, and no staying home (although recently, staycations have also qualified). Referred to internally as a “paid, paid vacation,” the stipend is enforced through a combination of vacation photo-sharing, communication channel monitoring, and self-reporting. A few years after launching the program, the company’s communications director, Brad McCarty, told the Washington Post that the program was working “incredibly well,” adding that when employees returned from these vacations they were “shining brighter, working harder, and more excited to get back into the swing of things.” Another popular approach is to structure vacations as paid sabbaticals. In 2011, just 4% of employers offered paid sabbaticals. By 2017, more than four times as many employers did. Because unused sabbatical time doesn’t have to be paid out when the term of employment ends, companies are able to offer more generous policies if they treat that time as a sabbatical rather than a vacation. In addition, especially in the academic sphere, sabbaticals are a culturally accepted way to take time for personal development not directly related to work. Reframing vacations as sabbaticals may help employees feel less stigma around taking time off. Focus on your core contribution. Countering busy culture means saying “no” to tasks that don’t align with your primary duties — and leaders have to set that example. Until the rest of your team sees you saying “no” to secondary duties, they won’t feel comfortable doing so either. Do you enjoy downtime when you get it, or do you fill it with less-than-critical work? Do you abandon side projects — which are only useful insofar as they serve your core focus — early and often? Does everybody you work with know what your primary duties are? Even employees you don’t work directly with should know what those duties are and recognize your commitment to them. On this front, too, a radical approach is often the most effective. In his book Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less, the leadership strategist Greg McKeown argues that to combat busy culture and create a healthier and more productive work environment, leaders should say “yes” to only the top 10% of the tasks presented to them. Show through your actions that your core duties are your priority, and make saying “no” to other work the norm. That’s the approach that the co-founder of CD Baby, Derek Sivers, has adopted. “If it’s not a ‘hell, yeah,’” he says, “it’s a ‘no.’” Sivers understands that it’s not bad opportunities that can kill his business but mediocre ones. Lean on lateral and external influencers. Culture is built informally, interaction by interaction. But no single individual can change the culture of a large organization alone. What works to effect change is positive peer pressure, exerted by social connections rather than top-down directives. Consider how Ben & Jerry’s finally got workers to use its nap rooms. At first, people were so embarrassed about using them that they would use phony names like “Donald Duck” on the signup sheet. After removing the signup sheet, Ben & Jerry’s realized a simpler system could still show everyone that the rooms were being used without revealing individual users’ identities: “If the door is closed,” a spokesperson explained, “you know it is being used.” Although rooms can no longer be booked in advance, Ben & Jerry’s realized the higher priority was making everyone feel comfortable using them in the first place. Similarly, the founder of Gabb Wireless, Stephen Dalby, who I met while working in the nonprofit world, struggled to put his phone down after work until his 6-year-old son asked a cutting question: “Daddy, can we play a game — or is your phone too important?” Despite founding Gabb to help young people spend less time on screens, Stephen struggled to turn off “business mode.” To combat this culture in himself and his team, he encouraged employees to establish small, daily traditions like device-free dinners — and he talked about those dinners at work, reminding his people that healthy boundary-setting was the norm. All companies get busy. The trick is to keep that busyness from becoming chronic and cultural, because when that happens, it also becomes corrosive — no matter how productive or positive it may seem.

"166",166,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/preventing-burnout-is-about-empathetic-leadership","work life.txt","Taking a one-size-fits-all approach to burnout prevention won’t help. Resilient leaders make quick pivots and remain nimble. Empathetic leaders dial in to the needs of their employees and adjust to the moment. And human-centered leaders give their companies a fighting chance to flourish in the middle of a global pandemic. This article explores how empathetic leaders are helping employees to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic in healthy ways, and how you can, too. Take our survey to share your own experience with burnout during the pandemic. How many of us are currently living without margins — the space to handle life’s simplest stresses. I know I’ve fallen into this trap myself. It can happen after being mentally stretched and dealing with chronic stress for too long. Basically, we are left with zero margin for error. It also means that we don’t realize we’re at our max until it’s too late. Before we know it, we’ve hit the wall. As part of the research that I’m doing for my forthcoming book on burnout, I spoke with Dr. Marie Åsberg, MD, psychiatrist, expert in exhaustion disorder, and professor at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. It’s from Dr. Åsberg that I learned about “hitting the wall.” She describes this as the moment “where some additional burden is placed on the employee and they experience a mental break.” She showed me the evolution of this disorder over an 18-month period. An employee tends to experience small ebbs and flows of stress and then suddenly, a cliff. That one stressor isn’t any different from any others, it’s just the final blow — the straw that breaks the camel’s back. The margins eventually give way. A brand-new survey of 3,900 employees and business leaders across 11 nations, led by The Workforce Institute at UKG (Ultimate Kronos Group) and Workplace Intelligence, discovered that burnout and fatigue are equally concerning for employees working remotely (43%) and those in a physical workplace (43%). Overall, three in five (59%) employees and business leaders say their organization has taken at least some measures to guard against burnout, though nearly a third (29%) of employees wish organizations would act with more empathy. The key word here is empathy. In my communication with leaders, I encourage them to rethink the definition of empathetic leadership — particularly as it pertains to preventing burnout. We tend to connect empathy to the golden rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” But I don’t believe that goes far enough. If you authentically want to demonstrate empathy you have to “Do unto others as they would have done unto themselves.” That requires stepping outside of your own needs, assessing and removing bias and privilege, actively listening to your people, and then taking action. I did discover some bright spots in my research — there are plenty of leaders who are working tirelessly to bridge the divide. During interviews for my book, I wandered into these stories of authentic empathy — the use of golden rule 2.0 — to stop burnout from rapidly escalating. These leaders were (and still are) pivoting their policies and practices at lighting speed — attempting to stay one step ahead of the pandemic’s destructive path. All of them are learning on the fly and abandoning old thinking for new approaches, as they realized that what may have been helpful at the start of the Covid-19 lockdown could quickly become harmful. For example, they realized that asking employees to spend hours on end on video conferences, and then expecting them to come back on for an afternoon happy-hour or morning yoga, was defeating the purpose of those activities and turning well-being into workload. Todd McKinnon, CEO of Okta, says he realized during the pandemic that his people weren’t taking the time off they needed to recuperate. “The data shows that, at home, our staff were kind of working 24/7.” Although he assumed that giving Fridays off would help, his staff just ended up working Saturdays because the workload remained the same. So, he decided to change the deliverables. “If you really want to take the pressure off the team, you have the adjust the workload.” Although the payoff for Okta employees remains to be seen, McKinnon has the right idea here. First, we leverage data-based decisions to quickly assess what is at the root of the stress. Then, we employ upstream strategies to tackle the problem. And, being patient and supportive about people’s fears right now will be critical to preventing burnout. Take for example, Eugenie Fanning, VP of People at Squarefoot, a tech-enabled commercial real estate company based in Manhattan, who shared in our interview that during the pandemic, reinforcing trust has helped to mitigate burnout. Understanding that there was fear about returning to the office, her team went far beyond the standard safety protocols  in an effort to reduce anxiety for their staff. Employees had the autonomy to choose when they would return, and for many, the office was a respite from working at home. Parents with children under 18 comprise almost one-third of the U.S. workforce and many of them are suffering. Nearly half of parents (46%) saying their stress level is high (between 8 and 10 on a 10-point scale where 1 means “little or no stress” and 10 means “a great deal of stress”) according to the American Psychological Association’s report, “Stress in the Time of Covid-19.” It’s likely why my conversation with Jamie Coakley, VP of People for Electric, a New-York based IT Solutions company, resonated. She has been working to address the major impact on working parents. Coakley set up a parent forum to open up discussions about how parents are faring during the pandemic. It was after seeing an exchange between two senior VPs that she realized how challenging it had become. One senior executive just put it out there, “How are you all doing this?” The response, “We’re not. You’re either a bad parent or a bad employee.” Coakley had already instituted flex hours, planned to introduce a childcare stipend, and opened the office for anyone who needed it. But she says, “We’ve started to brainstorm that next layer of support. Flexible hours are not enough. It’s not really solving for the day-to-day challenges of having to be in two places at once. So, my job now is just better programming and support for our parents.” Both of Jamie and Eugenie’s examples are rooted in empathy. Their actions tell a story. “How can I make you feel safe? What else can I do to help? I’m not afraid to keep learning. I can do more.” Dr. Chris Mullen, Ph.D., executive director of UKG, agrees: “Even though the economy is struggling, organizations have a tremendous opportunity to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic even stronger than before. By going back to the foundational needs that should form the basis of the employer-employee relationship — physical safety, psychological security, job stability, and flexibility — they will cultivate newfound trust and empathy.” Elaine Davis, Chief Human Resources Officer at Continuum Global Solutions, leads an organization of mostly hourly workers — about 17,000 — who are based in call-centers. In mid-March, she moved all of them to remote work — no small feat. Davis knows that her staff, comprised of majority female workers and many single moms, are overwhelmed by the juggle right now. The biggest need for her employees? Davis says it’s pay. Obviously, in any organization, appropriate compensation is a top priority. But, for many hourly workers, getting paid could mean the difference between getting access to medical care, keeping the lights on, eating properly, or even preventing an eviction — situations that are becoming even more precarious during the pandemic. According to a survey of more than 3,000 hourly workers by Branch, a wellness platform turned challenger bank, approximately 80% of hourly workers had less than $500 saved for an emergency, and 52% had $0 saved because of the pandemic — a 12% increase from last year; 76% had already delayed or missed a bill payment. In light of this reality, Davis joined up with the CEO of Branch, Atif Siddiqi. His company had already been partnering with employers that wished to give employees’ access to a portion (50%) of their pay before payday. Particularly for employees who’d been hit hard from Covid-19, it helped to keep their heads above water. If you’ve read my other Harvard Business Review articles on burnout, you’ll see conversations with Dr. Edward Ellison, a medical doctor and co-CEO of The Permanente Federation, frequently cited. He wrote about the massive negative impacts of physician burnout in the Annals of Internal Medicine, and has spent a large part of his career prioritizing strategic burnout prevention in the places he’s worked. When I spoke to Dr. Ellison this time around, he was right in the epicenter of the fires ravaging his home state of California. He’d previously created practices and procedures for the communities he serves in response to the wildfires — such as increased virtual and in-home care. But now with Covid-19, he’s trying to juggle both situations, all while prioritizing the safety of his staff. He says, “When you talk about the biggest questions related to burnout and mental health, the first thing our staff wanted to know at the outset of the pandemic was, ‘Can you keep me safe and can you keep my family safe?’ I had to ensure that they were also taking care of themselves.” Although Dr. Ellison says he’s worried about the potential risk of his employees experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of this “horrifying experience,” he’s taken away some critical learnings. “First, we realized we can be agile and nimble — we reacted very quickly. Second, we realized how well our members, patients, physicians, and staff embraced telemedicine/telehealth. And third, there was an undeniable commitment to interdependence and selflessness — a leaning-in and helping approach to the job each day, which was something that kept us in really good stead.” And yet, it always comes back to relationships. Friendships at work — whether in person or virtual — can be the difference between surviving these extremely stressful events, or burning out entirely. “I think there’s a tendency in the pandemic for everyone to feel alone, especially with physical distancing,” says Dr. Ellison. “But for caregivers, it becomes all about what connects you. Often, that’s the camaraderie with other members of the team, and the sense that team members can lean on one other to deal with the isolation and grief — both in their personal lives and when they’re losing patients they’ve come to really care for.” Although some situations may seem more dire, each of these issues is a real threat to the mental health and psychological safety of our people. We, as leaders, all have to meet different needs for the individuals we serve. If there’s one more lesson we can take away from the pandemic, it’s that burnout was always there, but in times of real stress, it explodes. What is compelling about Dr. Ellison’s experience and the others I mention is their uniqueness. From balancing family burnout, to the fears associated with entering a physical office, to managing overwork, to protecting lives, they reinforce the reality that taking a one-size-fits-all approach to burnout prevention won’t help. Resilient leaders make quick pivots and remain nimble. Empathetic leaders dial in to the needs of their employees and adjust to the moment. And human-centered leaders give their companies a fighting chance to flourish in the middle of a global pandemic. *** It’s time to rethink burnout, and you can help. We want to hear from you.

One method to do so in the U.S. is through an IRA, a savings account made through a financial institution that builds interest over time. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. My 19-year-old sister and I are roommates in Boston, and despite my best efforts to not be “Dad,” I’m for sure acting like ours. I’m on a mission to convince her to start saving for retirement. Talking about retirement is peak Dad mode. I see it. I get it. I can hear myself. Or rather, I can hear our Dad saying, “Make sure you’re saving.” But she’s skeptical, and full of logical questions, like: “Seriously, why do I need another savings account?” My preferred investment vehicle is an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) — it’s a savings account made through a financial institution that builds interest over time and is taxed either when you add funds (Roth IRA) or withdraw at retirement (that’s called a Traditional IRA). Unlike your typical 401(k), these accounts aren’t tied to an employer, and the average percentage rate of returns fluctuates anywhere between 5% and 12% over a lifetime. (That’s much higher than the typical savings account interest rate of about .06%.) There’s a saying I really like about saving money: “Make your money work for you.” You can work to earn money, sure. But how do you also make your money…make more money? That’s where interest comes in. To put it simply, interest is the money that automatically builds on the funds you put into your savings account. And IRAs have compounding interest, which means interest is built on the gained interest. This means, with an IRA, your money makes a little bit of money, and then more interest is made off of that new money, and so on. That’s how your money grows “faster” over time and why it’s “smart” to start saving young. “Learn from my mistakes,” I tell her. By the time I took the plunge, I was 26 (I’m 28 now) — meaning I’d missed out on a few years of collecting interest on my own money. “Do you want to have to work into your old age?  What if you get sick and can’t work? What if you want to retire early?” But my sister is philosophical. She starts in with the existential questions: “Isn’t it true that you can’t access that money until you’re in your 50s? Will we even live that long? What’s the point?” This question is tougher for me to answer coherently. She thinks she’ll die young, and throwing money into an account she doesn’t think she’ll ever use seems kind of pointless. “What are you even saving for?” she asks. What’s the use in having money that you can’t access readily when you may need it the most now? Is it safe to trust financial institutions during an economic recession? Is retiring really realistic anymore with so much student loan debt, the high cost of health care, and rising housing costs? I needed help answering these questions, both for my sake and my sister’s. So I brought them to an expert: Megan Leonhardt, a senior money writer for CNBC. Megan has published extensively on financial planning, and she says that Gen Z should take advantage of saving for retirement early. Here’s what I learned from our conversation. Is it true that if I put my money into an IRA, I won’t be able to access it until I’m in my 50s? Your money isn’t untouchable. When you contribute to an IRA, your money isn’t locked away in some unattainable place. It’s not as easy to access as your checking account, but it is accessible. I know that experts [say] “Don’t touch your retirement savings,” but there are a lot of exceptions where you can actually use that money if you run into real problems. It’s not locked up forever. Yes, you will have to pay some penalties on it, depending on how you’re using it, but if you need that money, it’s there, and it could be a safety net. The penalty is a 10% fee if you withdraw before age 59-and-a-half, but there are a few penalty-free exceptions. It’s also worth noting that if you use a Roth IRA, you can withdraw any contributions from it at any time, penalty free. Will I even live to see that money? If you’re worried that you won’t live to see your funds, consider using a will to designate your money to a cause you believe in, should the worst happen too soon. I myself and so many Millennials and Gen Zers [are] passionate about trying to find causes that we can really get behind. Certainly, naming family and friends as beneficiaries is a good option too — but no matter the outlet for your money, it’s good to know that if you don’t live to see your retirement funds, someone else will. Can I actually trust financial institutions? Yes, but do your homework. We feel the repercussions of financial problems when they hit. The 2008 recession was 12 years ago, but those who lived through it don’t struggle to remember it. Banks were bailed out by the taxpayers, yet it feels like some Wall Street CEOs still got bonuses while retirement funds disappeared. It was scary. I watched my parents’ 401(k) get wiped out by 30% to 50%. A healthy amount of skepticism is really crucial to have, because it forces you to make sure that you’re understanding everything and also protecting yourself. These institutions have millions of customers, and unless you’re paying for a financial planner’s help, you’re on your own. If a financial planner meets with you, take their card and do some digging. Read up on the companies. No institution is perfect, and if you see complaints against them, look for patterns. When you’re done, ask yourself: “Can I sleep at night?” If you can sleep at night, and all you’ve done is a quick Google search, and everything looks fine, and you feel pretty comfortable with this, that’s fine. If you are sitting there, and you are losing sleep, or you are not investing because you don’t trust these places, that’s when I’d say, do your homework, and do a thorough check. These financial institutions all have their own controversies. If there is a pattern of deception or unethical practices, steer clear. And you can also call them directly with questions. Where do I start? The sooner you start saving, the bigger your financial gains. Of course, life can get in the way, and doing your research takes time. But if you need help getting started, you can turn to a financial planner, advisor, or coach. I obviously realize that we’re all busy individuals, and sometimes the best path isn’t always the one you take. Still, it’s better to do something rather than nothing. What if you just don’t have enough to start saving? If you need the money to survive today, then hold off saving. If you’re struggling to pay for your necessary costs, it’s okay to recognize that you might not be in the best financial situation to put money away. This is especially true right now, when we have folks who are unemployed because of Coronavirus. I think it is perfectly fine to say, “At this point, I need to pay for the things that I need to survive today.” But if you do have disposable income, make sure some of it goes to retirement. It doesn’t have to be all of it, but it shouldn’t be none of it. My conversation with Megan brought me some much-needed clarity. If there are any first-time “savers” out there reading this, I hope you feel a little bit more prepared to start saving. If you’re wondering just how much you need to save to make an impact, Megan wrote about that too. After talking with Megan, I tried to relay her points to my sister, but she didn’t really care. And I totally empathize with that. The world is very different now. We are still living through a pandemic, and the future is uncertain. Next month is uncertain. Tomorrow is uncertain. But my sister still has time. I just hope she doesn’t wait as long as I did to start. Editor’s Note: The opinions expressed here are for general informational purposes only.

"169",169,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-to-identify-a-family-friendly-employer","work life.txt","If you’re a working parent interested in making a career move, a family-friendly employer is essential. Learning how the company has supported other parents — before you come on board — will help you understand if its actions and culture align with what you want and need. Before you look into potential employers, identify what you’re looking for and what you need. Think through important time commitments you have with your family that might impact work time and consider what benefits you want from the employer. Then, use three areas to do your homework: First, look at online resources, including the company website, published articles and interviews, and current and former employee reviews on third-party websites. Second, reach out to professional contacts that have worked for the company, and ask about their experiences. Finally, during the interview, push to find out what a day in the life really looks like at the company. If you’re a working parent interested in making a career move, it might not only be about finding a great professional opportunity. You may also want a more family-friendly employer. If that’s the case, it’s helpful to get a more complete picture of work life at the potential employer before you come on board. Learning how the company has supported other parents will help you understand if its actions and culture align with what you want and need. Before you even look into potential employers, identify what you’re looking for. This gives you the lens through which you look at an opportunity, so you can start to understand if this organization can give you the opportunity and lifestyle that you’re looking for. Think through the most important commitments you have with your family that might impact time at work, like eating dinner as a family each night, coaching your child’s soccer team, or assisting with remote schoolwork. Consider what benefits you want from the employer and how important they are to you and your family. Reflect on how your current or previous employers have fallen short to identify what was missing. It could also be helpful to visualize your ideal scenario as a working parent both today and long-term as your kids get older or your family grows. Then, as opportunities present themselves and you line up interviews, do your homework. You may feel limited right now, as we’re stuck interviewing remotely and not seeing office culture first-hand, but you can find a lot of information — as well as ask a lot of  questions — to find the right opportunity. Here’s how. Start with the company website. Review how the company talks about employees and what it shares regarding employee support. Creating an environment for working parents starts at the top. Look at senior leadership and the company’s board of directors. Can you tell if they have families? Do they talk about a family-friendly environment? Are there women? If you’re answering no to most of these questions, this may not be a family-friendly environment, especially at more senior levels, which could be a red flag for your long-term growth opportunities. Look, too, for any information about employee resource groups (ERGs), paying special attention to those provided to working moms and dads. If you want to add to your family, review any public information on parental leave and programs offered to new moms, such as a part-time ramp up or a work-from-home period. And see if they extend these options to new dads. Wherever the company features employees on the website, such as in published articles, on its blog, or in press releases, look for information on a day in the life that suggests a reasonable work life, or signals that colleagues and the company as a whole have positively impacted employees’ work life or family. (Accounting firm DHG, for instance, features such stories on its corporate blog.) Then, see how their stories compare to what else you find on the website. Go outside the company’s website, too. Do a quick online search for recent news, both good and bad. Read current and former employee reviews on places like Glassdoor and review top 100 lists in publications such as those published in Working Mother. If you plan on adding to your family, look for crowdsourced parental leave information such as List Your Leave to complement the company website information. And track down interviews with senior leaders to see what they share about their family life. In addition to online resources, tap into your network to get personal anecdotes about the company. You want to piece together a more complete picture of being a working parent with this employer. You might see warning signs or get ideas for questions to ask during interviews. Use LinkedIn and Facebook to find friends, friends of friends, connections through your professional network, or school alumni that may be employed, or previously employed, by the company. Talk to them about company culture and probe about official policy versus reality. If these are former employees, don’t be afraid to ask about why they left. Talk to them about work-life balance failures, as well. It could be as simple as, “Too many moms are put on a ‘mommy track’” or “All the working dads end up on the same team.” Perhaps the company tried a program to support working parents, and it didn’t work. What did the company learn? What can you uncover about why working parents leave? Is there a consistent pattern of working parents leaving because of a lack of support? When you reach the interview stage, ask about the position in question, but also aim to find out more about the company and its culture. Consider who is interviewing you and listen closely to what they share. If all of your interviewers say they don’t have a family or they have kids and a full-time, stay-at-home spouse or caretaker, this could be a red flag. This is a great opportunity to hear about a day in the life, too. Pay attention to the length of a typical workday and if there are back-to-back meetings or video calls, all day, every day. This could hint at long hours or an expectation to work late nights or early mornings. Another great topic to cover in your interviews is flexibility. Look for formal structures such as job shares, part-time options, split schedules, and day-to-day flexibility for when your child gets sick, has a school event, or requires your attention while you work from home. Covid-19 has shifted how employers approach flexibility, especially remote work. Ask about their experience during the pandemic. How did managers and the employer support employees who were supervising their children’s distance learning or entertaining young children? Are flexibility and remote work now built into the work culture — or was that considered temporary? And remember that being family friendly extends beyond managing work life with your children. Find out how this employer supports families with aging parents and sick family members as well. If you have specific questions about benefits, talk to your HR contact. Ask about the benefits and support structures for working parents. These benefits could include paying to transport milk for moms that pump while traveling or for back-up childcare and elderly care. And inquire about workplace wellness programs that help prevent things like burnout. Choosing the right position is not only about checking the role for the right fit; you want the company to be the right fit too. Tap into the many resources available early on and during the interview process to uncover red flags, and do research to understand how work life will be with a new employer. There are many family-friendly organizations out there. Take the time to fully understand the opportunity both on a professional and personal level before you sign on."
"170",170,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/i-tried-four-tactics-to-get-better-sleep","work life.txt","Getting high-quality sleep is essential to one’s overall well-being. For four days, I tried four different techniques that would supposedly improve my sleep. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend here. I love sleep. And I can fall asleep just about anywhere: cars, airplanes, couches, floors. The only exception is potentially haunted houses. It’s not just the action of sleeping that I love. I have always been fascinated by the study of sleep, because, get this — scientists still have no idea why we sleep. Of course, there are theories, like how sleep helps us organize our memories, flush out toxins, and restore our bodies. One thing scientists are sure about is that it’s bad when we don’t get enough sleep, especially high-quality sleep. It’s the high-quality piece that has always been the problem for me. Like I said, I can fall asleep fairly easily. And I almost always get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Yet, there are still some days where I’ll wake up and feel like a literal zombie. And, to be honest, I’m kind of over it. (Also, I don’t have dreams anymore. I feel like that’s probably bad.) I wanted to figure out what exactly was going on, so for four days I tried four different techniques that would supposedly improve my sleep. I wore a smart watch to bed throughout this project to get some cold, hard data on myself. I also journaled daily to keep track of my mood and overall well-being. Here’s what happened: I wanted to see what kind of sleep I was getting on a normal night, before I tried any new tactics. According to the sleep app on my watch, I got a 74% quality rating last night — not bad (25% is considered terrible and 90% is great). I slept for six hours and 30 minutes, and apparently it took me 40 minutes to fall asleep, which was much longer than I expected. The app works by tracking my heart rate and movements to help estimate when I’m awake, in light sleep, deep sleep, or REM (Rapid Eye Movement). According to “science,” or at least the FAQ page on my sleep app’s website, to achieve the best quality sleep, an adult should aim for the following values: 5% awake, 35% light, 35% deep, and 25% REM. Last night my values were: 17% awake, 30% light sleep, 34% deep sleep, and 19% REM. Things are getting pretty technical here, but basically, I have some room for improvement. When it comes to how I actually feel today, I’d give it a solid “meh.” I don’t feel terrible but I also don’t feel like jumping on a couch or anything. Meditation has never been my thing. Believe me, I’ve tried, but I always come up with an excuse to blow it off. So last night, I forced myself to try meditation for sleep. Meditating before bed is supposed to help you clear your mind and wind down, thereby creating a better environment for higher-quality sleep. I did a five-minute exercise called a “visualization,” where the guide basically tells you to imagine that each individual muscle in your body is “shutting down.” I found myself sort of giggling and fidgeting through the first minute or so, but then it did start to feel pretty relaxing. It felt like I was sinking into the bed, and when it was over, I could barely open my eyes. Which was both good and bad. Although my brain had shut off during the actual meditation, it came back with a vengeance. My eyelids were heavy, but I wasn’t actually tired, so of course I started overthinking. My brain raced with thoughts about the pandemic, all the awkward things I said yesterday, and how I can’t believe [redacted for spoilers] was actually “Gossip Girl” the whole time. Despite all of this, I was able to fall asleep fairly quickly, but it definitely felt like light sleep. According to my watch, it took me 20 minutes to fall asleep, but my quality rating was lower at 66%. I slept for about eight hours, but 49% of my sleep was “light sleep” (should be around 35%), and only 11% was REM (should be around 25%). And today, I do feel a bit groggy. (It’s also Monday, so read into that what you will). My verdict on meditation for sleep: It’s nice for helping you fall asleep faster, but for me, it didn’t impact my quality of sleep. And pro tip: make sure you’re actually tired before doing it or you might end up like me, experiencing the opposite effect. Last night, I went after what I suspect is my biggest problem: My addiction to watching “The Office” until I fall asleep. As comforting as it is to have some familiar background noise, I’d be lying if I said I’m not frequently woken up in the middle of the night by the loudest theme music of all time. Plus, apparently all the blue light from television and phone screens is really bad for your circadian rhythm (basically the thing that helps regulate your sleep and lets you know when it’s time to wake up). So I tried out the technique of not using any screens (phone, e-reader, television, laptop) for two hours before bed. Instead of playing video games or watching some terrible show on Netflix (Re: “Gossip Girl”), I listened to a podcast, did some arts and crafts, and read a few chapters in the latest sci-fi book I’m into. It was super relaxing. And the best part is, it WORKED. First of all, I woke up feeling actually refreshed. I didn’t even feel the immediate need for coffee. (Who am I?) As for the data, my sleep quality score went way up to 84%. I slept for a little more than eight hours, and it only took me 10 minutes to fall asleep. My REM sleep was right on target at 25%, as was my awake time at 6%. I even had a dream! (I was a football coach or something, it was super weird.)  I’m actually shocked that this worked, and a little sad that it means I should probably stop watching TV in bed. Yesterday, I took all of that extra energy and put it towards an intense workout. I’m pretty good at regularly fitting in 30 minutes or so of exercise, but nothing too crazy. And I know getting exercise is really important to helping you get a good night’s sleep. What I didn’t know is that the time of day you exercise actually matters a lot. I am very much not a morning person, so I normally workout right after work, if not later. Apparently, working out too late at night can negatively impact your sleep, and it’s better to workout first thing in the morning. I compromised with a 60-minute, early-afternoon workout. As for how I slept last night, it wasn’t great. I feel kind of hungover this morning (one of those no-alcohol hangovers that means I’m dehydrated from something else). Even though the workout felt great, I definitely didn’t drink enough water after, and I think that made the workout tactic backfire. Lack of proper hydration can also negatively impact your sleep quality, and I felt that for sure.  I would like to try this tactic again because I think it has its merits. But, there are ways it could have the reverse impact if you don’t hydrate properly or if you exercise too closely to bedtime. I’m writing this entry on Wednesday in the midst of missing my afternoon jolt. Consuming large amounts of caffeine has been proven to negatively impact sleep quality. I had coffee this morning because I was afraid of getting caffeine withdrawal, but I’m cutting out my usual afternoon cup to see what will happen. I’m mad at myself for this one. Mostly because I’m one of those people that considers being highly caffeinated to be a personality trait. Believe me, I’ve cut back from the double espressos I used to down in college. But I’m still on pretty strict orders (from myself and definitely not a medical professional) to drink at least two caffeinated beverages a day. Well, not today. (What’s the caffeine version of hangry? Because that’s how I feel right now.) *18 hours later*: Okay, it wasn’t that bad. After my morning coffee today, I can admit that I was being a little dramatic yesterday. And I actually slept really well last night. It took me a bit longer to fall asleep, around 30 minutes, and I only slept for seven hours. But my sleep quality went back up to 82%, and my awake, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM values were all the closest they’ve been to the optimal combination.  In terms of how I feel, I’m definitely ready for the day. I don’t feel like superwoman, but maybe I would if I kept this up. Or chugged more coffee … either one will work right? When I find something that’s comfortable for me, I tend to just stick to it. So this experiment has given me a nudge to push against some not-so-great habits. I realize that a few of these tactics will likely take more than one try to show a significant impact on my sleep quality. But even going through the motions and trying out the different methods for better sleep was insightful. If I had to suggest you try one of these tactics, it would definitely be the “no screens” one. It takes the opposite of effort and had the biggest positive impact on how I actually felt the next day. I’ve tried it a few more times since my formal experimentation period ended, and I’ve always ended up feeling more rested. Let me know if you found this experiment insightful in the comments (or you can also just tweet at us), and maybe next time I’ll try out your favorite tactic for a whole month and report back."
"171",171,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/how-to-let-go-of-working-mom-guilt","work life.txt","Working moms are chasing the balance of working a job that they want and being the mom that they envisioned. They feel bad about letting their kids, team, or boss down, and also feel guilt about practicing self-care, remorse for not helping aging parents enough, or embarrassment about admitting their stress. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has left working parents — and in particular mothers, who still disproportionately take care of the housework and children — having to find solutions for education and childcare. If you’re a working mother, you must let go of this guilt. Consider these five tips. First, forgive yourself for your choices and circumstances. Second, revisit your values and make them your top priorities. Third, ask for help from those around you. Fourth, remember the basics of being a good parent and let yourself be “good enough.” Finally, unfollow those on social media that bring you down. You wonder if every other mom feels the elusive work-life balance stress the same way you do. You feel time running out to achieve your career aspirations while your kids are growing up so quickly. No matter where you are, at home or work, you feel like you should be elsewhere, getting something productive done. Secretly, you dream of a weekend away but come up with excuses as to why you can’t do it. In her book Forget Having It All, author and journalist Amy Westervelt sums up the working mom dilemma: “We expect women to work like they don’t have children, and raise children as if they don’t work.” Because of this, women feel guilty — guilty for working and guilty for not. Blurred boundaries of work time spill into family time, and half listening to your children’s stories from their day or missing out on meaningful time with them can lead moms to feel like they are failing. The obstacles to being a volunteer at your kid’s school or attending the science fair has you plotting how to sneak away from work unnoticed, so that you might be able to make it just in time for your kid to look up and see you there (all while still checking your inbox for any urgent emails). It feels like a no-win situation, and it fuels feelings of overwhelm, exhaustion, and defeat that can lead to burnout. Working moms are chasing the balance of working a job that they want or need and being the mom that they envisioned. You don’t just feel bad about letting your kids, team, or boss down; you also feel guilt about practicing self-care, remorse for not helping aging parents enough, or embarrassment about telling a friend how stressed out you are— as if you don’t have a right to feel this way. What’s more, the Covid-19 pandemic has left working parents, and in particular mothers, having to find solutions for education and child care. The windows into their world have been opened for all to see as women still disproportionately take care of the housework and children while working. As a result, guilt is permeating everywhere as kids spend more time on screens and moms spend more time on Zoom. Working on letting go of this guilt should be at the top of your long to-do list. It eats away at you, disrupts your sleep, affects your mood, and gets in the way of being present. My experience counseling working mothers has shown me that, while they do still feel stressors, they also experience significant relief when they are mindful and intentional about their mindset and behaviors. Here are some strategies to start freeing yourself of guilt, starting today. Forgive yourself. Letting go of guilt has to start with a commitment to stop beating yourself up over your choices and circumstances. Guilt gone awry turns into shame, and it is emotionally painful to constantly feel like you are a bad mom, a bad employee, or a bad friend. Instead, remember the reasons behind your choices. Every time you think to yourself, “I feel bad about __” replace that with, “I made that decision because ___” and then move forward. Revisit your values. For years now, I have worked with parents who experience guilt over their parenting decisions or their hours at the office (or now, the hours plugged into work at home). One of the most grounding exercises people can engage in is getting clear about what their values and priorities are in life and then living life in accordance to them. So often people say one thing matters to them most, but they don’t live into those values. For instance, if family time is at the top of your list but you don’t feel like you get enough of it, rid yourself of guilt by consciously finding ways to spend more time with your family. Practice saying “no” to unnecessary commitments, like volunteering at every school fund-raiser, going to a regular happy hour with coworkers (even virtually), or sitting on your neighborhood HOA board. Involve your children in tasks you already do, like completing chores, making meals, or taking the dog for a walk. Or use your weekends intentionally, dedicating blocks of time for family, rather than errands. This will likely entail setting clear boundaries in other areas of your life and constantly revisiting (and updating) your family values statement so that you are in integrity with what you want. Ask for help. One of the hardest things for many women to do is to ask for help. Instead of asking for help, a working mom may just be fueling her stress by trying to do it all herself — then realizing that it is just impossible. Asking for help takes practice, but once you take a vulnerable step in doing so, others around you will start doing the same. Reach out to neighbors, personal friends, parents of your kids’ friends, your own parents, your in-laws, the aftercare program at school, or carpool parents. Before you know it, no one has to feel bad for asking, and it becomes a reciprocal relationship in which everyone benefits. Be “good enough” at home. The idea of the “good enough parent” goes back decades. Attachment researchers, such as John Bowlby, discovered that parents need to be emotionally present, to comfort their child, attune to their child’s feelings, show delight when seeing their child, and support their child in order to have a healthy and secure parent-child attachment. In other words, they are caring for and connected with their child, without sacrificing their personal needs and health. We need to follow this example and lower the bar from the perfect mom who can do it all, who does everything she “should” be doing, and is praised for her selflessness to the mother who reclaims her own life and takes care of herself. Rather than putting additional pressure on yourself, remember the basics. Realize the connection you can still have with your children by simply being “good enough.” Unfollow those that bring you down. Watching other people vacation, share their family photos, or publicize their latest promotion on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram is enough to drive a working mom to tears. The time you take to scroll on social media for connection is a time that needs to lift you up. If you find that a person or group’s posts consistently bring you down, unfollow them. Last, remember that guilt is inherently tied to empathy. Feeling guilty means you have compassion, care, and concern for those around you. Getting rid of your guilt does not mean that you are not a loving or kind mother. It means that the empathy behind the guilt will be realized. Instead of feeling stuck, the power of compassion can motivate you to connect with your work as well as find the joy in being a mom. Sheryl G.

"172",172,"https://hbr.org/2020/09/when-your-boss-doesnt-respect-your-family-commitments","work life.txt","Working for a boss who dismisses your family commitments can be exhausting. This is particularly challenging during the pandemic when many people’s work and home lives have collided. How should you handle a boss who refuses to acknowledge the other demands on your time? You can start by having a one-on-one conversation in which you’re honest and transparent about your situation. Describe the additional responsibilities you’ve taken on at home, but also exude confidence and commitment to your organization. Ask your boss about their pain points and priorities, and then place their objectives front and center of your work agenda. Make it clear you have a plan for how you’ll work day-to-day, as well contingencies for when and if circumstances shift. Your boss needs to know that you’ve got the situation under control. When trying to balance your work and family commitments, it helps to have a boss who is understanding and supportive: someone who doesn’t raise an eyebrow when you sign off early to attend a school event or take a personal day to accompany an aging parent to a doctor’s appointment. But what if your manager isn’t sympathetic to your familial responsibilities? Or worse, your boss is outright dismissive or is even hostile toward your obligations? This is particularly challenging during the pandemic when many people’s work and home lives have collided. How should you handle a boss who refuses to acknowledge the other demands on your time? How can you find room for flexibility? What should you say about your family commitments? And who should you turn to for moral and professional support? Too many working parents and other employees with extensive caregiving responsibilities have stories of a manager who gives them an assignment at 4 pm and asks for it the next morning, or a boss who makes disparaging comments about another working parent who doesn’t seem loyal to the company. “There are some managers who are unsympathetic to the challenges their employees face at home and some who intentionally turn a blind eye,” says Avni Patel Thompson, the founder and CEO of Modern Village, a company that provides technology solutions for parents. “Other managers may have positive intent but lack empathy or ideas on how to [support their employees].” When you work for a manager who doesn’t recognize your family obligations, your strategy must be multifaceted, says Ella F. Washington, professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business and a consultant and coach at Ellavate Solutions. You need to figure out how to productively navigate the situation with your boss, while also collaborating with your colleagues and family to create a schedule and “set boundaries” that work for everyone. The goal is to “try to get your boss to meet you halfway,” she says. Here are some ideas. First things first, “know your rights” and understand what you’re entitled to in terms of paid leave and care options, says Thompson. Do some research into your company’s policies and whether there are alternative work arrangements on offer. Long before the pandemic hit, an increasing number of organizations instituted flexible work plans for employees, and many states have flex-work policies in place for their government workers. Find out, too, if your situation qualifies you for the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The law requires some employers to provide paid leave to workers who must care for someone subject to quarantine or a child whose day care or school is closed. Washington recommends talking to your company’s HR person, if you have one, to learn what options and accommodations are available to you. “Knowledge is power,” she says. Next, have a one-on-one conversation with your boss in which you are “honest and transparent about your limitations,” says Thompson. Make clear your commitment to the company and your team, but also explain the additional responsibilities outside of work. After all, your manager’s lack of sympathy is likely not malicious, but thoughtless. For instance, if your boss doesn’t have children, they may be aware of the “superficial or obvious” tasks related to remote learning during the pandemic, but oblivious to the fact that parents are also serving as their kids’ tech support, math tutors, writing coaches, and line cooks, says Thompson. It may not be an easy conversation. But don’t let your discomfort cause you to avoid the subject. “Silence is what makes managers nervous,” warns Thompson. Remember, too, you’re not throwing a woe-is-me pity party, says Washington. “This isn’t about making excuses” — you’re stating facts. Your tone should exude confidence and commitment. Next, summon compassion. It’s not easy to be a boss, especially right now. Many managers are under pressure. “They’re stressed, anxious, and struggling to do more with less,” says Washington. Consider the situation from their perspective. Thompson says your empathy should be both “genuine and strategic.” Ask your manager about their pain points. Find out where their worries lie. Be sincere — show you care about them as a human being — and be tactical. Ask about their “objectives and the metrics they need to hit,” she says. “You’ll get important information about what they’re concerned about” which will help you sharpen your focus in terms of the work you prioritize. Once you “understand what’s top of mind” for your manager, you can frame your plans for getting your job done in a way helps them achieve their goals and objectives, says Thompson. Focus on results. When you’re a caregiver, your schedule can often be unpredictable so it’s important to make a plan as well as several contingency ones. Address your manager’s “insecurities about you not pulling your weight” by demonstrating that you’re “making arrangements to get your work done.” You want your manager to come away from your conversations thinking, “They’ve got this.” Don’t be shy about reminding your manager of your track record for delivering on expectations, adds Washington. “Your past performance is the strongest indicator of your future performance,” she says. Hopefully, your manager will come to see “that what’s most important is not how the job gets done, but that it gets done.” Always keep your boss in the loop, says Washington. If you’re not in the office, you might consider “instituting a daily check in” or at least providing an email update every few days. “Your objective is to make your manager feel comfortable that the work is getting done,” she says. This communication doesn’t need to require more face time though. Instead of a status update conference call, you could write an email to your team that lays out “your objectives for the week and gives visibility to what you’re working on.” Or in place of a team meeting on Zoom, encourage your colleagues to “collaborate on Slack,” which allows you to “fire off messages even while your kids are sitting next to you.” If your boss is a face time tyrant, it can be tough to establish boundaries, but it’s still important to do. We all need time in our day that’s off-limits for work, says Washington. “If 6 pm is when you have dinner and put the kids down,” so be it. “Have those boundaries — and let your boss know that you will be unavailable then.” But if your manager continues to be disrespectful of your family time, you need to have a conversation. Frame the discussion around you — how you prefer to structure your workday and how and when you perform best. Explain that you need your non-work hours to regroup and take care of your family commitments. Without that time away from work, you will not be able to fully devote yourself to your job. If your direct boss continues to be difficult about your family commitments, make a concerted effort to find allies within your organization, says Thompson. These allies might include peers, colleagues in different departments, and managers outside your division. “Build relationships with people who see you for the whole life that you have,” says Thompson. “That way, if down the line if things gets contentious [with your boss] you’ve got options.” In addition to broadening your professional network, allies offer moral support, says Washington. Talk to your colleagues and find out how they’re balancing their jobs with their caregiving responsibilities. “Find out how others are making this work,” she says. Working for someone who doesn’t respect your life outside of work can be exhausting so make sure you’re taking time for yourself. Be purposeful about giving yourself “a forced mental break,” says Thompson. Make time to read, cook, dance, run, meditate — or any other activity that you enjoy or helps you relax. “Schedule joy,” she says. And even if exercise isn’t usually your thing, Thompson suggests finding time for it every day, especially during this difficult period. “Don’t underestimate the power of 20-30 minutes of daily physical activity,” she says. At a time when your boss is being difficult and “nothing feels in your control,” getting your endorphins pumping should be a priority. Even with your best efforts, the situation may not improve. In this case, Thompson’s recommendation is to be the best employee you can be under the circumstances. “Make sure you deliver on expectations,” she says. “Don’t give your boss any ammunition” against you. Your boss might never be empathetic to your personal situation, says Washington. “If you’re not getting support and the organization is not being inclusive of your needs, maybe this work environment isn’t the best for your career development,” she says. It may be time to move on. Do Don’t Case Study #1: Talk to HR about what you’re entitled to — and be willing to move on if the relationship doesn’t improve. Jennifer Walden, director of operations at WikiLawn, an online company for garden professionals, says that while her current employer and manager has been flexible and accommodating regarding her family commitments, she wasn’t always as fortunate. A few years ago, when she worked in the gaming industry, her boss — we’ll call him Jerry — was unsympathetic to the fact that Jennifer was a mother and that one of her children had health issues. “It was really hard,” recalls Jennifer. “I remember feeling guilty because I felt I was much less productive at work when my daughter was having complications. I was constantly worried about her.” From the moment she took the job, Jennifer was open and transparent about her responsibilities at home. “I remember asking my boss early on if there were opportunities to work from home on days when my daughter’s health was especially poor,” she says. Jerry said no. “He shut down any conversation having to do with remote work and flexible schedules,” she says. He was overbearing and expected immediate responses to his calls and emails — even on weekends. Jennifer, meanwhile, was diligent. After a couple of months, she followed up with Jerry to plead her case. She talked about her commitment to the company and pointed to her conscientiousness and past track record of meeting her deadlines. “I tried to alleviate his fears by being proactive in saying how I’d make up any missed work, alter my schedule, and check in regularly from home,” she says. He still didn’t budge. She began reaching out to colleagues on her team for support and encouragement. She learned that many of them had similar frustrations. Together, they decided to talk to HR. “HR did help somewhat,” she says. “I fought for the right to work from home on the days my daughter was struggling — our organization allowed this, even though my boss hadn’t previously signed off.” But ultimately, the stress of working for a manager who dismissed her personal life wasn’t worth it. Jennifer left the job. Her experience at Wikilawn is entirely different. “We have unlimited PTO here,” she says. “My boss also frequently asks after my daughter and whether or not I need more time to get projects done when her health issues flare up.” Case Study #2: Show your commitment to the company and deliver on expectations. Willie Greer, founder of The Product Analyst, a Memphis, TN-based company that produces technology and product reviews, says he knows well what it feels like have his family commitments dismissed by his boss. A few years ago, he worked as an HR manager in the digital marketing industry. At the time, Willie had young children at home, and a spouse who also worked full-time. When he first started at the company, he and his boss — we’ll call her Sheila — had a good working relationship. Willie was a top performer, and Sheila trusted him by giving him more challenging, high-profile assignments. But after Willie’s child care situation changed, their relationship grew tense. Willie asked if he could leave work early two days a week in order to pick up his kids from school, and Sheila turned him down. “I told her I would make up the work at night, but she said that I was needed in the office,” he says. Willie knew he needed to take action. First, he empathized with Sheila. He asked her about her priorities and concerns. She told him that she was under a lot of pressure from management and that she was particularly nervous about several looming projects. Second, he demonstrated his commitment to the company and his job. Willie told Sheila that he would focus his attention on those projects. “I wanted her to know that the work was in safe hands,” he says. Finally, he was open and honest about his familial responsibilities. “I told her that my children were young, and that I needed a little leniency and flexibility.” Sheila wasn’t enthusiastic about his request, but she agreed to a trial. Willie kept his focus on the projects and made sure that he hit every deadline. He sent Sheila regular updates and status reports to assuage her worries. And two days a week, he left work an hour early to pick up his kids. The situation improved, but Willie still felt unhappy. “I wanted to work for a manager that values her people and who understands that there is more to life than work,” he says. He landed a new job relatively quickly and, not long after that, he founded his company. “I’ve created a working environment where employees can become the best versions of themselves.” Rebecca Knight is a freelance journalist in Boston and a lecturer at Wesleyan University.  Her work has been published in The New York Times, USA Today, and The Financial Times."
"173",173,"https://hbr.org/2020/08/how-to-actually-save-time-when-youre-working-remotely","work life.txt","The pandemic has given many of us the opportunity to ditch the commute and work from home long-term, offering huge potential time savings. But to truly reap the benefits of remote work during the current crisis and beyond, we need to think proactively about how we restructure our workday in this new normal. The authors suggest six concrete, research-backed actions you can take today to create clearer work-life boundaries and optimize how you spend your time. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. While the widespread shift to remote work hasn’t been without its challenges, it does offer a major silver lining: For many of us, commuting has become a thing of the past. In the United States alone, eliminating the daily commute has saved workers around 89 million hours each week — equivalent to time savings of more than 44.5 million full workdays since the pandemic began! These numbers suggest that working remotely could be a deus ex machina for reclaiming one of our most precious and limited resources: time. But despite the potential for staggering time savings, many have struggled to achieve everything they hoped the pandemic would finally make time for: baking sourdough, meditating, or writing the next great literary masterpiece. On the contrary, data we collected from 12,000 people across the U.S. and Europe during the pandemic show that the additional time is often burned on unproductive work and unsatisfying leisure activities. Having more time does not necessarily mean that we use it wisely. So, what are we doing wrong? Without an office to commute to, the separation between work and home becomes tenuous. Although research shows that people rate their commutes as one of the most stressful and undesirable parts of the day, having no commute at all causes problems too. In a series of studies, we found that being on the road can help people switch gears between home and work, and that without a commute, people struggle to separate their work and personal lives. Instead of shutting down the computer and rattling home on a crowded train at 6 PM, many people are working later than ever, “just one more email” stretching into an extra two hours hunched over the laptop. And that additional work time is not always well spent. In our studies, people reported being stuck in more meetings during the pandemic than before, doing too much “agenda-setting,” not doing enough creative collaboration, and filling their time with more unproductive work. In a perfect illustration of Parkinson’s law, that work expands to fill the time available for its completion, the average 53 minutes per day people saved by not commuting was often immediately absorbed by additional, less productive work. When people did manage to gain free time, it often wasn’t spent wisely: Our surveys found that activities we call “passive leisure” — such as watching TV — rose dramatically, while “active leisure” activities such as volunteering or socializing became less frequent. While a bit of passive leisure is a healthy way to relax, our research suggests that it’s much less likely than active leisure to promote happiness. Admittedly, the pandemic has made many active leisure activities challenging. But we’ve seen plenty of creative ways to pursue active leisure while following social distancing guidelines, such as Zoom game nights and happy hours, clever socially distant sports, and virtual volunteering. During a time of global crisis, it’s healthy to prioritize relaxation, and it’s natural that we might struggle to maximize productivity at work. But as we return to semi-normalcy, what can we do to ensure we use our time savings to pursue meaningful activities that make us truly happy? Through our research, we found several strategies that can help you structure your workday to enable clearer boundaries and more time for active leisure: For many of us, commuting was when we would get into “work mode.” But that transition doesn’t have to come from a physical commute. Research shows that the most-desired commute length is 16 minutes, so when you’re working remotely, take that time to find another way to transition into work mode. (We don’t mean literally pretending to be on a subway, as some Londoners have taken to doing.) Specifically, a recent study of ours revealed that the happiest commuters are those who use their commutes to plan their workdays. So try starting your remote workday by taking 15 minutes to plan your day, either at home or with a short morning walk. In fact, walking is a form of active leisure that’s known to reduce stress, so it’s good idea to find ways to deliberately build some walking back into your day. In Germany, the Feierabend is a daily evening celebration marking the moment when work is switched off for the day — often accompanied by a hearty German beer. Whether you finish the day with a beverage, a snack, going for a run, or calling a friend, find a ritual that can mark the end of your workday and give you something to look forward to. These daily routines help you celebrate what you have accomplished during the day (rather than focusing on what still needs to be done), bringing life meaning and happiness. If your to-do list is anything like ours, it is always too long. To avoid drowning in work, identify a must win for each day — one thing you need to achieve no matter what — and then pursue it at full steam. In the face of constant interruptions from email and messaging platforms, staying focused on your top priority is a real accomplishment. And if you complete your must win, research shows the resulting sense of achievement is likely to have a significant impact on your happiness. Protect your calendar from never-ending Zoom meetings by blocking out “pro time,” or time reserved for work that is highly important, but not urgent. Our studies have found that scheduling a daily pro-time block, in which you turn off all distractions and focus on specific tasks, helps employees feel more effective and less overwhelmed. Pro-time can prevent you from focusing only on the next deadline and getting bogged down with less meaningful work, making your days feel more productive and less stressful. The strategies above can help you get some of your time back. But more time in and of itself is meaningless — it’s what you do with it that matters. Are you using your newfound free time to connect with other people? To start exercising, or volunteering? Just like scheduling pro-time during the workday, we recommend being proactive about scheduling active leisure activities after work. This doesn’t have to be a big commitment. Research suggests that short informal social interactions (whether in person or digital), as well as just 10 or 20 minutes of active leisure, boosts well-being. This isn’t about dedicating two hours to socializing every day, but rather spending 20 minutes catching up with a friend or going for a walk. You can even maximize active leisure by combining social time with other pursuits, such as exercising together with a friend. This way you can kill two birds with one stone; plus, involving others in your goals makes it easier to stick to them. In addition, try building social opportunities into the flow of your normal workday. For instance, studies show that using commute time to connect with others — even strangers on a train — promotes happiness. To replicate this while working remotely, perhaps part of your end-of-day routine could be a chat with a family member or friend. Today, we’re all part of a grand experiment in how we use our time. But even after pandemic restrictions are lifted, it’s a good idea to keep trying out new time management schemes to see what works best for you. For example, here at the University of Zurich, our team invented a “3-2-2 week” that gives us a good balance: each week, we spend three days at the office (yes, we think the commute time is worth the conviviality that only the office can afford), two days working from home, and two days dedicated to family and friends. Experiment with structuring your days and weeks in different ways to see what feels best for you, during the pandemic and beyond. Around the world, shifting to remote work could save billions of hours — but it’s up to us to spend that time well.

"174",174,"https://hbr.org/2020/08/how-to-plan-child-care-in-uncertain-times","work life.txt","When Covid-19 hit, the foundation of every working family’s careful balance was pulled out from under them —namely, school and child care. Now families are navigating suboptimal options for schooling, and others are navigating tricky issues, like understanding the risks of sending a child back to day care, whether they can afford the cost of a tutor, nanny, or part-time sitter, whether this is the opportunity to move closer to family for help, or whether to cut back at work to help weather the uncertainty for the family. The author recommends a three-step approach to help working parents build plans that they can adapt for a range of situations: First, list your priorities and pick three you want to protect most. Then, make multiple plans for each priority — a Plan A, B, and C. Finally, put the plans in action, with ample buffer. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Lisa and Geoff are a dual career couple, living in Chicago, IL with their six- and eight-year-old sons. Until last March, managing two careers and two kids was challenging — especially without family in town — but they had figured out a routine that worked for them. The boys were in kindergarten and second grade at a neighborhood school they loved that also had a great after-school program. Work was demanding and engaging but manageable. Like most families today, it wasn’t easy, but it worked. Then Covid hit and the foundation of every working family’s careful balance was pulled out from under them — namely, school and child care. While Lisa and Geoff managed to cobble things together for the rest of the school year and through the summer, they held out hope that the fall would bring a return to some semblance of structure and certainty. That hope was shattered when, like many school districts across the country, their school announced options for 100% remote learning or a limited hybrid model of two days in school and three days remote. Now Lisa and Geoff, like millions of other working parents, are left wondering how they’re going to manage. Some are navigating suboptimal options for schooling — trying to decide whether structure, socialization, and support of an in-person classroom outweighs the health risks and extra complexity of managing remote learning at home (if given the option at all). Others are weighing different questions: understanding the risks of sending a child back to day care; whether they can afford the cost of a tutor, nanny, or part-time sitter; whether this is the opportunity to move closer to family for help; or whether one partner needs to cut back at work to help weather the uncertainty for the family. As the founder and CEO of a company that builds software to help working parents manage the weekly complexities of running a family, I’ve seen variations of these dilemmas play out in thousands of households. There are different priorities and situations for each, but the worry, anxiety, and exhaustion are all the same. What we’ve found is that there are two things at play: Given this, we’ve found it’s important to help parents build plans that work for their specific needs but that can also be adapted for a range of situations. Here are three steps for how you can do the same. Parents are already master prioritizers, but in times of greater uncertainty, we need to protect the most important things — no matter what. Make a list of all possible priorities in your family’s life. (To make it feel less daunting, focus on just the next quarter.) Then, pick the three that you want and need to protect most. This doesn’t mean that the others aren’t important, but just that anytime the top three are in jeopardy, the rest will have to take a backseat. For instance, a single parent living close to high-risk grandparents may prioritize their extended family’s health, their job, and their family’s social and emotional health. A dual-working couple with elementary-aged kids may prioritize their relationship, consistent logistics, and both jobs. And a single-income family with a high-risk child may put education, physical health, the parent’s job first. Even though each of these families have core child care needs, what their priorities are will guide the options they’ll explore. A starter list of priorities for your consideration include: Now that you have your top family priorities, consider how you’ll best be able to maximize each as using three sets of options: Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C. Plan A can be what is ideal, assuming all is going as planned. Plan B is your classic backup for when A falls through for the most obvious reasons, like a sick caregiver, an unexpected injury, a scheduling conflict, and so on. Finally, Plan C is your safety net, a potentially more drastic option if the first two stop being effective. To create these plans, consider how options on the table might vary depending on your priorities. For instance, if extended family is a priority, like it was in the single parent example above, your options may range from including grandparents within your bubble, choosing remote learning, or taking the opportunity to move to be closer to family. Protecting your career may mean reducing your child care uncertainty; options can range from hiring a nanny to teaming up with two to three other families in a similar position and taking turns handling last-minute hiccups. For education, you might decide to dedicate part of your budget for a private tutor that can supplement school curriculum, or you might keep learning opportunities at the forefront all week through real-world adventures and explorations. Consider your priorities and outline plans that work within them — what you want to do, a backup, and a third-tier option. With the plans and options identified, it’s time to enlist the help of others and create actionable weekly plans. Communicate the high-level points of your plan with people in your life — from your nanny or sitter to helpful neighbors and fellow parents in the community that you might be collaborating with during Covid. With high-level plans in place, it’s time to execute efficiently. We’ve found that the greater the uncertainty, the greater the gains in proactive planning vs. last-minute reacting. Families we work with find that dedicating just 10 minutes on Sunday evening to plan the week ahead results in fewer missed things, an ability to anticipate tricky spots, and a general feeling of family cohesion and collaboration. We also found that this approach saves roughly 20 minutes each day that is otherwise spent in researching, debating, and deciding — a number that easily adds up to a critical 10 hours a month. To get started, schedule a standing weekly meeting with your partner (Sunday evening after the kids are in bed is a popular time). Then, use this guide to walk through the six main areas: Despite the best-laid plans, we know each day can and will bring unexpected challenges. The goal, then, is not planned perfection, but something solid that you and your partner feel good about. Families have never been under greater pressure to manage a tremendous amount of uncertainty, while needing to make critical decisions that involve our health, learning and relationships. In this marathon, we need all the help we can get in lessening the uncertainty and creating plans that work for our specific needs, whether that’s in the time of a worldwide pandemic or simply another week as working parents.

"175",175,"https://hbr.org/2020/08/new-mothers-lets-talk-about-professional-identity-crisis","work life.txt","Parenthood — especially for women — changes you. After giving birth, the brain actually redesigns itself, trimming old connections and building new ones. If you’re someone who has constructed your adult identity around your career, these changes to how you operate can shake your foundations. Even more unnerving, though, is the sudden instinct some feel to actually want to engage in motherhood above all else. The collision of these two identities can lead to an identity crisis, anxiety, depression, and burnout. There are two mental “rethinks” that working mothers can use to figure out how to approach the complicated new world they find themselves in. First, rethink success. Redefine “success” as getting stuff done both in and out of the office — not just “grade A” work. Second, rethink yourself. Instead of feeling that your identity has been disrupted, think of it as having been expanded. You were once yourself — now you’re yourself, plus something else. Parenthood changes you. The roles you used to play, the identities you used to claim — lawyer, dog lover, spin enthusiast — all come second to your new responsibilities. For some, this rearrangement of priorities can lead to a crisis of identity. This is especially true for women, who for both social and neurological reasons tend to feel the split demands of home and work most acutely. As a clinical psychologist focused on the mental health challenges of people in high-pressure careers, I often read articles and papers about how to get back to “feeling yourself” after becoming a parent. But there are no easy answers, no top 10 lists of tips and tricks that can bring instant comfort and clarity. Rachel*, a longtime therapy client of mine, was a successful trader who had — as far as I could tell — never failed at anything in her life. So, she never anticipated that being a working mother would be something she couldn’t handle. Multitasking in a high-stress environment was basically her job description. How hard could it be to add on a few extra tasks at home? But when Rachel returned to work after maternity leave, she felt like she was floating, distracted. She couldn’t perform to her own standards at the office and felt like she was dropping the ball at home, too. She had built her identity around her competence and intelligence. Now that all seemed to belong to someone else. Recent research into the neurobiology of motherhood has provided some hints about why new mothers often find the return to work so challenging. After giving birth, multiple neurological and structural changes occur that can make it difficult for the new mother to exactly replicate her previous functioning. The brain actually redesigns itself, trimming old connections and building new ones. The result appears to be a brain optimized for “theory of mind” — the ability to understand what others might be thinking and perceiving. These cognitive and perceptual superpowers helped keep our ancestors alive while living among woolly mammoths. They also give mothers that uncanny ability to analyze their new baby’s cries and guess exactly what the infant needs. But the brain doesn’t know about our modern work environment; those connections that got trimmed might have been the ones that you relied on to get your job done. If you’re someone who has constructed your adult identity around your career, suffering from “mommy brain” can shake your foundations. Even more unnerving, though, is the sudden instinct some feel to actually want to engage in motherhood above all else. The collision of these two identities, these two seemingly incompatible ways of being — that’s the recipe for a good old identity crisis. Losing your bearings like this isn’t just uncomfortable. It can lead to anxiety, depression, burnout, relationship issues, and even substance use. And for most of my clients who are working parents, the chaotic shift to remote work in the time of Covid-19 has made things even harder. The boundaries that they once could draw between the household and the office have been blurred, and the human relationships that once gave work meaning have been reduced to a matrix of disembodied, video-chatting heads. No wonder that so many of us feel so unlike ourselves. Sorting out your identity can be a long and complicated endeavor, but there are two mental “rethinks” that I often use with my clients to help them figure out how to approach the complicated new world they find themselves in. Rethink success. You used to aim for maximum efficiency and effectiveness. Now, you can give yourself a gold star just for survival. You’ll have to let a lot go and adjust your definition of success. I guarantee you’ll come out ahead if you give yourself credit for all your work on the home front. To do so, try redefining “success” as getting stuff done both in and out of the office. Where success might once have meant closing a big client over steaks at a swanky place downtown, it now might mean whipping up breakfast for dinner (ignoring the mess all over the house) as you shout silly songs to your kids giggling in the other room. That client might take an extra day or two to sign, but in the meantime, you’ve been racking up the wins at home. You’re doing way better than you’re giving yourself credit for — frame those parenting victories as something to be celebrated. Rethink yourself. Our identity goes through many changes through the course of our lives. Instead of feeling that your identity has been disrupted, think of it as having been expanded. You were once yourself — now you’re yourself, plus something else. There’s room to become more. Parenthood is far from the first time your identity has undergone a shift. Taking on big personal projects like training for a triathlon can often shift our perceptions of ourselves. In that way, adding “parent” to your identity shouldn’t require you to abandon old parts of yourself, any more than adding “triathlete” or “great cook” or “photographer” should. We’re often our own most vicious critic. Let go of some of the pressure you’re putting on yourself and treat yourself with the understanding and flexibility you’d grant to your best friend. Would you rip your friend for feeding their kids chicken nuggets two nights in a row because something came up at the office? You’d probably laugh about it with them, and then pass the ketchup. Above all, realize that there are no easy answers, just the hard work in becoming a better (if more complicated) version of yourself. And after you help fight a worldwide pandemic by working from home, answering emails through a soupy brain fog while your toddler is screaming for mustard with their nuggets instead — you’ll get there. *Name changed to protect identity"

But the research is clear: Vacations lead to improved productivity, lower stress and better overall mental health. It also spurs greater creativity — for example, Lin-Manuel Miranda conceived of Hamilton while on vacation. Even if you can’t travel, the author recommends following these six guidelines to help you make the most of your time off: Get a change in scenery; plan ahead; identify the type of experience you want to have; spend time outdoors; unplug; and create memories. Many of us have had our summer vacation plans cancelled due to the pandemic. Perhaps you planned to visit family or take your annual beach vacation. Or maybe you were scheduled to celebrate a milestone with big trip — a food and wine tour of France or an African safari. Whatever your thwarted plans entailed, you might be thinking of skipping a vacation altogether. And given that productivity has been hampered for many of us over the last few months, it’s easy to think, “I should keep working, so I can get more done,” or “What’s the point? I can’t really go anywhere.” Don’t give in to this limited thinking. Several studies indicate that performance nose-dives when we work for extended periods without a break. In addition, the benefits of taking a vacation are clear: It results in improved productivity, lower stress and better overall mental health. It also spurs greater creativity — for example, Lin-Manuel Miranda conceived of Hamilton while on vacation. Research on elite athletes shows that rest is what enables them to perform at peak levels, and the same is true for us. Taking a vacation allows us to come back feeling refreshed and recharged, with renewed focus. Some companies are even requiring employees to take time off. Vacations may even help your personal bottom line: Research shows that those who take more than 10 days of vacation are 30% more likely to receive a raise, and those who take regular vacations have greater job satisfaction. While your plans will likely look different than before, below are some guidelines to help you reap the benefits of vacation, wherever you go. Get a change in scenery. Vacation doesn’t need to entail extensive travel. The fun of it is going somewhere that is different from your daily life. This may be a short drive from home, an extended road trip, or an excursion to the other side of town. One friend rented a beach house for her family 10 miles from her home. A team member rented an RV with her family and drove to the mountains with another family. (Each family had their own RV and got tested for Covid-19 before leaving.) Another colleague took a solo weekend a few hours outside his city at an Airbnb to read and reflect. Another team member planned gourmet food excursions in her own city, seeking out the best versions of her favorite foods in different neighborhoods across town. Plan ahead. While a spontaneous getaway can be exciting, research shows that the stress of poorly planned vacations can eliminate the positive benefits of time off. In particular, planning a month ahead and focusing on the details in advance versus figuring things out while on vacation has been shown to result in a better vacation experience with more positive outcomes. Planning ahead also gives us something to look forward to — something that Gretchen Rubin, author of The Happiness Project, says not only makes us feel good, but also adds an “atmosphere of growth” to our lives and makes us optimistic. Even if you’re only going across town, you can still identify which days you’re going to take off and plan what you’re going to do in advance. Identify the type of experience you want to have. The ideal vacation is different for each of us. What is your idea of recreation? What allows you to recharge? What nourishes you? For some, it’s soaking up the sun by the water. For others, it’s a creative pursuit, exploring a new location, trying new cuisine or engaging in an adventure sport. Knowing this will help inform potential destinations and activities. You might not be able to take that cooking class in Provence, but you can still go to the countryside, have a gourmet experience, and cook Provençal cuisine. Spend time outdoors. Research shows that spending time in nature benefits us both mentally and physically. Moreover, these benefits are reaped whether you are in a national park or an urban park, and with as little as two hours in nature per week. Whether you’re traveling or staying home, build in time outdoors as part of your vacation, whether it’s taking a morning walk, skipping stones on a lake, watching the waves crash at the beach or picnicking in a small park. Being outside also provides open space and more social distancing (aside from the occasional crowded monuments or visitor centers). Unplug. A 2017 Glassdoor study showed that two-thirds of Americans work on vacation. Doing so has been found to negatively affect intrinsic motivation and causes us to enjoy our work less. Unplugging from work is a big part of what makes vacation feel like vacation. It’s down time for our brains from the barrage of cognitive demands that come with our jobs. It creates the space for creativity to emerge and allows us to be fully present with our families or travel partners. My colleague who went on the RV trip sans laptop and cell reception felt liberated and like she was able to truly slow down and reset. She let clients know in advance she’d be unavailable during that time. My friend who rented the beach house brought games, puzzles, a good book, and some wine and relished being able to disconnect from work. To be sure, disconnecting can feel difficult — many people fear missed opportunities or the back-to-work email dread. Identify a colleague who can answer questions while you’re away and indicate this as well as how you’ll be following up (if at all) in your out-of-office message. Create memories. Vacations are also great opportunities to create lasting, positive memories. Several studies show that recalling happy memories can head off stress, anxiety, and depression — something that is much needed in our busy lives and even more so in current times. Since it’s easy to capture the most enjoyable moments of our vacations with a smartphone, go ahead and record singing around the campfire while eating s’mores. Take pictures of the scenic views, your picnic spread, the fish your teenager caught, or the thousand-piece puzzle your family put together. You’ll enjoy revisiting these memories in the months and years to come. As easy as it might be to keep on working and skip a vacation, don’t. Following the suggestions above can provide you with an experience that leaves you refreshed and re-energized, and you don’t have to go very far to do it. So, get packing and go. You’ll be glad you did. Rebecca Zucker is an executive coach and a founding Partner at Next Step Partners, a boutique leadership development firm.

It’s time to take those hackneyed words, “our people are our greatest asset,” to heart. If you are an important asset, how could depriving, devaluing, and depreciating that asset by running it in harsh conditions, powering it with improper fuel, and neglecting routine maintenance possibly be good for your organization? Your resilience is a high-priority business issue if you’re leading a team through the stress of our fast-paced world. When you invest in proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, and play, you’ll have the self-control to manage your own reactions, the energy to be fully present for your team, the patience to listen and empathize, the wherewithal to make good decisions, and the stamina to keep it up for weeks or months. Investing in your resilience isn’t indulgent; it’s mission critical. As a manager, leading in this era of change, urgency, and accountability requires so much. You need the energy to be fully present even as you’re fretting about the 72 emails piling up in your in-box. You need the patience to be empathetic when facing resistance from your employees. You need the wherewithal to be creative instead of defaulting to tried-and-true approaches. You need the self-control to be open and vulnerable without losing your team’s confidence. And you need the endurance to be present, patient, creative, and controlled day after day and week after week. In sum, you need tremendous fortitude. Although most leaders I interact with have a sense of the fortitude, energy, and stamina they require to be successful, few of them make investments to bolster those things. Is that true for you too? You know that sufficient sleep, proper nutrition, physical exercise, human connection, and time to relax are important, but do you carve out time for them? Or, like many of the leaders I advise, do you tell yourself, “It’s so busy, I can’t afford to…(spend seven hours sleeping, or stop to get lunch, or keep up with hobbies).” That framing, which casts investments in your resilience as contrary to the best interests of your organization, is doing both you and your organization a great disservice. It’s time to take those hackneyed words, “our people are our greatest asset,” to heart. If you are an important asset, how could depriving, devaluing, and depreciating that asset by running it in harsh conditions, powering it with improper fuel, and neglecting routine maintenance possibly be good for your organization? Let’s cut to the chase: It’s not. Take sleep. The CDC says that one-third of American adults don’t get sufficient sleep. If you’re in a stressful managerial role, I suspect you’re among that group. Your reasons for forgoing sufficient sleep might seem logical: Before going to bed, you need to respond to the emails that came in while you were in meetings all day; you need to cut off an hour of sleep in the morning to read the material for your 8AM meeting with your boss; you have to schedule a conference call with the Hong Kong team at 11 PM. There are lots of reasons to shortchange your sleep that seem very reasonable on the surface. Now consider the other side of the coin. At the very least, sleep loss hinders your cognitive capacity by degrading your alertness and attention. You might argue that your venti coffee is all you need to perk yourself up again. It depends. Research shows that stimulants are reasonably effective at reducing the effects of sleep deprivation on standard, rule-based tasks, but they are not helpful when it comes to tasks that require creativity or divergent thinking. If your organization is counting on you for more than menial, routine tasks, you might want to reconsider whether squeezing more into today is worth sacrificing what you can contribute tomorrow. And rest is only one of the investments you need to make to keep your machine in top form. You need to eat the kind of food that will fuel your prefrontal cortex, where much of a manager’s action happens. If you’re trying to survive by eating fast food on the go, you won’t have what you need to maintain your energy and focus throughout a very long day. You also need to hydrate to stay on top of your game. Multiple studies have shown that even mild dehydration can affect both thinking (memory and attention) and mood (tension and anxiety). Add to the list exercise and some time to relax and reflect, and you’ll have the energy, patience, creativity, and endurance to successfully lead your team. And what if you need that best version of you now? What if you’re sleep-deprived, hungry, and tired, but you’ve got an important meeting in 20 minutes? It’s possible to get your energy level up in a pinch. Try one of the techniques below to boost your micro-resilience. If that meeting in 20 minutes is a one-on-one with a colleague or a direct report, try doing a “walk and talk” instead of sitting down. A walking meeting is a great way to create a free-flowing conversation. It is an especially good idea if you need to have a contentious conversation, because reducing eye contact can make those difficult conversations a little easier. If your walk can be around trees or grass, all the better. That will not only make your meeting more effective but will also put some gas in the tank for the next one. Another option if you’re feeling spent and wishing someone would scoop you up and carry you to Friday is to find someone in the office whom you can help. Grab a colleague and a coffee and provide some coaching or mentoring. Recent research suggests that being empathetic to others and helping them reframe their situation aids your own emotional regulation. If you’re feeling an emotional hijack as your resilience is waning, take a moment to hit the reset button. First, name the emotion you’re experiencing; that will make it less powerful. Next, take a deep breath by exhaling as much as you can and then relaxing to let the air refill your lungs. Use a sensory cue to evoke more-positive emotions. Listen to a great song while walking to your next meeting. Grab a butterscotch candy and think of your granddad. If my energy is low when I’m facilitating, I find a discrete moment to put on my favorite lip balm; the berry scent is an immediate pick-me-up. You can also boost your micro-resilience with a quick reconnection to what matters most to you. Add a sticker to your laptop, put a string around your wrist, load an inspirational quote onto the lock screen of your phone, or do something similar to give yourself a tiny mid-meeting reminder of the bigger picture. Your resilience is a high-priority business issue if you’re leading a team through the stress of our fast-paced world. When you invest in proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, and play, you’ll have the self-control to manage your reactions, the energy to be fully present, the patience to listen and empathize, the wherewithal to reject your defaults and make good decisions, and the stamina to keep it all up for weeks or months. When those investments seem easier said than done, choose a quick micro-resilience technique as a pick-me-up. Investing in your resilience isn’t indulgent; it’s mission-critical. From now on, tell yourself, “It’s so busy at work right now, I can’t afford NOT to take care of myself!”  Editor’s Note: We updated this article on 8/20/20 to remove a reference to a research study that has been called into question.

Zooming out, the rest of our digital team sits in an open space, while our print colleagues tend to work in cubicles. It’s not perfect: It’s often freezing cold, and it’s hard to find quiet places to edit. But we have working internet, coffee, and a printer. Big windows look out over a highway.

"179",179,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/dont-work-on-vacation-seriously","work life.txt","As more and more employees shift to flexible work schedules, it’s become increasingly common for people to work during time off. But new research shows that working on weekends or holidays can have a significant impact on intrinsic motivation, leading to both lower employee satisfaction rates and lower quality work product. To combat this, the authors suggest a simple but effective strategy for situations in which working during time off is unavoidable: by mentally reframing time off as “work time,” you’re likely to feel more motivated, find your work more meaningful, and put more effort into your work. How — and when — we work is fundamentally changing. Data from the 2018 American Time Use survey indicates that 30% of full-time employees report working weekends and holidays, and even when people officially have time off, that doesn’t mean they stop working. Moreover, the recent global shift to remote work due to the Covid-19 crisis could further exacerbate the situation: as the formal boundaries that separate work from non-work become even more blurred, employees may feel conflicted about what time is — and isn’t — meant for working. Many people assume that flexibility in when we work should boost motivation. Being able to set our own schedules should empower us to coordinate our days to maximize productivity at work, which would suggest that people might actually be more motivated when they work on weekends and holidays. In addition, research shows that keeping yourself busy (as opposed to doing nothing) can make you feel productive, and thereby make your work feel more meaningful, suggesting that working at a time when others are not could actually boost motivation. However, our research finds that the opposite is often true. Spending weekends or holidays working undermines one of the most important factors that determines whether people persist in their work: intrinsic motivation. People feel intrinsically motivated when they engage in activities that they find interesting, enjoyable, and meaningful. Our data shows that working during leisure time creates internal conflict between pursuing personal and professional goals, leading people to enjoy their work less. Yet, in doing this research during weekends and holidays ourselves, we also uncovered a solution to this problem: reframing time off as “work time” can help people maintain intrinsic motivation for their work. To answer this question, we analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 1,298 U.S. employees. Employees indicated whether they worked some weekend days or worked only Monday through Friday. In this dataset, intrinsic motivation was captured with statements such as: “the work I do is meaningful to me” and “my job lets me use my skills and abilities.” We found that on average, people who worked some weekend days felt less intrinsic motivation for work. Given that this was correlational, it is possible that there are other factors that might influence how intrinsically motivated people feel, such as working in a lower-level position. That said, we did control for many potential confounding factors, including household income, education level, weekly work hours, and general life satisfaction, and found that the relationship between work time and intrinsic motivation held consistently. To further examine the relationship between work time and intrinsic motivation, we ran four additional experiments with both adults working on the weekend and students studying during school holidays. Across all studies, we found that working during time off reduced people’s intrinsic motivation for their work. For example, in one study, we interviewed students studying in a campus library during a federal holiday. We either reminded students that it was a federal holiday (“Today is February 17th, President’s Day”) or not (“Today is February 17th”). When students were reminded that they were studying during a time that others had off, they found their study materials to be less engaging or enjoyable — that is, they felt less intrinsically motivated to study. Similarly to how many people think of Monday as the “true” start of the week, people generally categorize their time as either for work or for leisure. When they engage in work during time that they think of as leisure time, such as the weekend, they experience conflict between their expectations and reality, and as a result, they find their work less engaging and less meaningful. Unfortunately, in many roles, occasional work on weekends and holidays can feel unavoidable. So, what can you do to stay motivated when you have to work during time off? In our research, we found an intervention strategy that helped students studying during Spring Break and employees working on a Saturday maintain their intrinsic motivation: re-labeling time as “work time.” For example, in one study, we told one group of people working on a Saturday, “People usually use weekends to catch up or get ahead with their work” and told another group, “People usually use weekends to relax and take a break from work.” Our data suggests that even though both groups were working during time off, the first group felt more interested and engaged in their work goals because they were thinking about the time as time to work (versus time to relax). One caveat to note is that intrinsic motivation isn’t the only kind of motivation that inspires people to work. People also work because of extrinsic motivation (i.e., to receive a salary, support a family, etc.). And while working during time off has a negative effect on intrinsic motivation to work, across our studies we found no evidence that it impacts people’s extrinsic motivation. While goal conflict associated with working on weekends or holidays undermines our capacity for finding work inherently meaningful, it doesn’t change the value of getting paid or having job security. Nevertheless, research by Kaitlin Woolley and Ayelet Fishbach shows that without intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation is often insufficient to keep people content and doing their best work. The takeaway is clear: Whether we enjoy the work we do is shaped not only by the type of activities we engage in, but also by when we engage in these activities. If you have to work during time off, try to reframe it mentally as work time to help you maintain your motivation. Managers can also support their employees by encouraging them not to work during time off, as our data suggests that working during time off can undermine intrinsic motivation and thus reduce the effort that employees put into their work. Understanding how to stay motivated has always been important, but as the pandemic forces many employees to work remotely and burdens them with additional demands on their time, these strategies will be particularly crucial to ensure you and your team stay as productive and engaged as possible.

But as the pandemic forces millions of parents (and their children) to stay home, working parents are facing a whole new set of challenges. HBR reached out to working parents all around the world to find out what strategies have been effective for them as they try to work through these impossible circumstances. We’ve compiled our favorite pieces of advice for staying productive — through this crisis and the next. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. A few months into the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, we reached out to working parents on HBR’s LinkedIn Group and asked them to share advice about how they’re getting things done in these impossible circumstances. Great ideas flowed in by hundreds from around the globe, and we’ve collected 18 of our favorites here. Some of the main themes include setting boundaries and carving out time for focus; getting extended family involved; and embracing “good enough” while remembering to play, laugh, and be present. My husband and I both work from home, and we stagger the times we wake up. I wake up early in the morning while the baby is still asleep to do my work and he wakes up late. I go off to sleep by 10 PM after feeding the baby and putting her to sleep. And he stays up till about 3 AM to do his work. This is the only way we can reserve energy for a kid during daytime. —Tanya M., mother of one, U.S. Every day when I look at my to-do list, both work and home, it seems overwhelming. The first thing I do is give it the D3 review. Which of these items can be: 1) Delayed; 2) Delegated to another member of your team (it is not dumping on them, it is an opportunity for them to learn new skills); 3) Doesn’t need to get done! Paring down what “has to be done today” reduces my stress! —Lori K., mother of two, U.S. We have a Kanban board (software development version) for household chores. To-Do — Doing — Done. The kids (as most of us) prefer a pulling system rather than a pushing one. It gave them a feeling of independence in terms of what and when to do their parts. It led to less nagging and as a parent, I became more a coach than a boss. The system developed over time, with chores becoming more equally sized in terms of time (and tediousness), rules like “you can’t take the same chore two times in a row,” and due dates. —Magnus A., father of four, Sweden We established the “International Corona School” and the “students” would get stars for doing things and doing them right. The tasks included taking care of the cat, setting the table, taking out the garbage, hanging the clothes … and the total number of stars achieved on a given day would double if these things were done “over and above” or without being asked. We included “extracurriculars” such as cooking classes, or experiments such as observing how mold grew differently on slices of toasted bread after we touched them with washed hand and unwashed hands. I wore a ribbon in my hair and the kids called me “Frau Bego” to symbolically separate school time from the rest of the day. —Begoña S., mother of three and stepmother of two, Austria I asked the grandparents to get involved with the homeschooling during lockdown (by Skype, so socially distanced). The kids and grandparents both loved this idea, and they all prepared for it and looked forward to it every week. They taught about curriculum-related history topics, but in greater depth than expected at school, and introduced the kids to two foreign languages! Better than if we’d home schooled alone, and it meant my husband and I could get more work done. —Sally H., mother of two, UK I am a single mom by choice with a toddler. While the current crisis was beyond my imagination, I did put quite a bit of thought and planning into building a sustainable, enjoyable life for us. Here’s what helps me get through. —Victoria T., mother of one, U.S. If your child still takes regular naps, block your calendar for the duration of the nap: no Zoom or phone calls. Set aside this time to either focus on tasks that require your full attention or have a quick coffee break or alone time to recharge. —Lilla N., mother of two, The Netherlands Open communication matters. Talk openly about what your expectations are; be realistic. Communicate with your spouse about what your priorities are and how to divide household responsibilities. Delegate what you can. Outsource what you can. Let the rest go. Supporting each other goes beyond the to-do list. It is also about being present for each other. Proactively create a plan together for how you will connect with each other: whether it’s 15 minutes midday between Zoom calls or after kiddo bedtime. Make a point to ask about your spouse’s stories or worries from work. The more you can connect and help each other feel heard on the big things, the less the little things will matter. —Shanna H., mother of one, U.S. The crisis is bringing our families together in new ways through the remote work, education, and play, all done from our homes. For instance, in the past, I would go to my industry trade shows and conferences without my family, leaving home on Sunday night and not seeing them for a week. Today I connect to the events remotely from home, with my family “joining me” for selected public parts like spectacular industry shows and keynotes with celebrities. —Peter K., father of three, U.S. Some things I’ve learnt as we have huddled together over this period: —Praise M., mother of four, Singapore Honestly, giving ourselves permission to use media (learnings apps, Netflix, and YouTube principally) was simply a necessity. We finally lifted the guilt associated with screen time. And thinking long term, the increase in quality family time in comparison to the increased screen time, I evaluate as a net positive for the family. —Adam H., father of three, U.S. I certainly won’t win mom of the year for these tips, but they’ve kept me sane to date. —Nicola B., mother of two, South Africa My husband travels regularly for his job as an insurance adjuster and has been out of town for most of the shutdown. I tried to balance it all by myself, but it was too much — I felt like I was going to have a stroke and the kids were miserable. I saw a social media post from a teacher advising not to worry about the kids falling behind academically — they’re trained and ready to fix that later. It’s the emotional trauma that can’t be repaired and can lead to so many other lifelong problems. That influenced me enough to take family medical leave until school or childcare resume. From that point on, I threw myself into their non-traditional instruction and made sure that another sunny day didn’t pass us by. —Erin K., mother of two, U.S. We’ve had to develop some new boundaries for us all to thrive. “Stoplight” boundaries for my teens: Boundaries for me: —Quinn B., father of six, U.S. Grow your “extended family.” It’s so easy to set up a group on WhatsApp or Telegram where fellow parents can share their tips and crowdsource solutions that are relevant to your context. Don’t fall for the idea that you have to wing it alone; there are so many parents in the same shoes as you. —Osemhen O., mother of two, Nigeria I can caution against my poor strategy of relying too much on doing everything after my toddler’s bedtime when productivity feels highest. Good strategies include using a robot vacuum cleaner. —Linda L., mother of one, Sweden As a grandparent, our children are working and trying to balance work and home with their children 24/7. They are managing despite lots of stresses. However, we older parents need to be sensitive to their needs (they’re always our children, that never ends). We need to kick in and help them, too, if we live close enough or maybe travel to help. Ask them, “Can I take the kids for the weekend?” to give them a break. Give them some alone time, make them recharge! It’s a way to help our children and show them our love for family. Don’t wait for them to ask but be proactive and ask them. They will appreciate it. —Rob P., father of two and grandfather of two, U.S. My stress went down when I realized that looking back at this time in 20 years, the situation will be for my kid “that cool year I had a six-month holiday.” After all, plenty of people take a sabbatical or a gap year … it’s a unique experience for her. —Patrice O., father of one, Canada This article is adapted from the forthcoming HBR Working Parents series book, “Getting It All Done,” which will be released in December 2020.

"181",181,"https://hbr.org/2020/07/working-parents-your-family-needs-a-board-of-directors","work life.txt","Borrowing a classic concept from work—mentoring—can help you manage the large and small challenges you face in all aspects of your life as a working parent. Expand your professional board of directors to include people that will offer the advice and support you need to help you tackle family issues. To build out a robust team of advisors, select representatives from all different aspects of your life; tap people you trust, who are interested in you and your family; pick folks who have older kids to give you a preview of what lies ahead; include folks with kids younger than yours to give you an opportunity to give back and appreciate how far you’ve come; and identify folks with experience or perspectives to share. Many of the roles we play in our lives do not fit neatly into professional and personal categories. Covid-19 has brought this into high relief, by significantly eroding the distinction between work and home. Coping with life’s challenges in this ambiguous context can become a real challenge, but there’s an office practice that can help: mentoring. Our thinking about professional mentoring has evolved in recent years. The traditional model involved a senior-level mentor who advised and actively promoted the careers of more-junior employees, but a new and more effective model has emerged in which employees attach themselves to a whole set of mentors—a personal board of directors, as it were, that you can consult regularly to get advice and feedback on your work and career. This new model can actually help you at home as much as it does at work. Consider expanding your personal board of directors to include people who can help you think about family issues. It should comprise people you trust, have an interest in you and your family, and have experience or perspective to share. You’ll want to select a range of people from all different aspects of your life. Since each person has their own network of contacts, choosing mentors whose networks don’t overlap will make your interactions with them more beneficial. Here are some suggestions of people to include and how they can help: Once you’ve assembled your board of directors, stay in touch—and not just with holiday cards. Connecting on social media is the easiest and most fun to do. Pictures are wonderful ways to convey what you and your family are up to. But every so often, take an extra step to reach out to say thank-you for their friendship and support. It’s important. So is letting them know how their advice turned out. It doesn’t have to be elaborate. Just an email saying, “I followed your advice and talked to her teacher. It really worked!” But as all the writing on mentors will tell you, contributing your gifts in return is key to sustaining strong mentoring relationships. Pay it forward by contributing not just to your mentors but to their contacts and the professional or community organizations they support. Something as simple as donating to your mentor’s charity walk or buying pecans to support their kid’s school fundraiser. And if they help you with a reference to a great pediatrician, it’s easy to pay them back with a tip about a job lead. You probably already have friends or family whom you consult when you need to, so expanding them into a board of directors isn’t difficult. It’s only a matter of being intentional about it. With a little thought and effort, your board of directors will provide your working-family juggling act with resources, information, and emotional support, as well as a sense of perspective—the gift of a new way of thinking."

Now, with so many of us are working remotely, the boundaries between “home” and “work” have become increasingly blurred, making it even more difficult to switch off. The Myers-Briggs Company recently carried out a study, asking people about their personality type, behavior, views in regard to the always-on culture, levels of job satisfaction, and experience of work-home conflict. Researchers identified four overarching coping strategies, as well as differences within the Myers-Briggs personality types. We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers.

Technology has radically changed how we manage our work and lives. Services and information are available 24/7, and we can easily connect with anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world. All that convenience, however, comes at a price. When our smartphones are always on and within reach, we can find it difficult to “switch off.” We may have inadvertently become part of an “always-on culture,” with largely negative effects on our health and well-being. Research has demonstrated, for example, that being always on increases conflict and interference between our work lives and our home lives, that sending and receiving emails outside of conventional working hours contributes significantly to stress, and that compulsive internet use is linked to workaholism. And now that so many of us are working from home, communicating with our colleagues exclusively via electronic media, the boundaries between home and work can become increasingly blurred, making it even more difficult to switch off. How can we take advantage of the conveniences of modern technology while minimizing the disadvantages of an always-on culture? My organization, the Myers-Briggs Company, carried out a research study to find some answers. In 2018 and 2019 we surveyed more than 1,000 people, asking about their personality type, behavior, and views about the always-on culture. We also examined their levels of job satisfaction and work/home conflict along with many other factors. The results were revealing. Not all aspects of the always-on culture were viewed in a negative light; more than 10% of respondents said that being always on helped them stay in the loop and get quick responses, and it provided flexibility as to where and when they worked. And those able to access work emails or calls outside of the office reported greater engagement with their work and greater job satisfaction. But overall, the advantages were outweighed by the disadvantages. Nearly a third of respondents said they could not switch off, more than a quarter said that the always-on culture interfered with their personal or family life, and a fifth indicated that it could lead to mental exhaustion. Some expressed highly negative views; for example, one respondent said, “You burn out, no private life, no time for children, regrets at the end of your life, many tense situations, losing friends or close relationships.” Being part of the always-on culture often led to higher stress levels, greater work/home conflict, more distractions at work and at home, and increased difficulty focusing. We also looked at how people coped with the stress of being always on. Most drew on four overarching strategies — but different personality types reacted to them differently, so we’ll look at them through that lens. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator model assesses four aspects of personality according to whether individuals prefer to: Looking at the four strategies in light of personality type can help you identify how to use them most effectively to reduce the negative effects of being always on. If you have extraversion preferences, recharge by doing something active, perhaps with others (even if that happens virtually while you’re social distancing). If working from home, make sure to take breaks. Go for a walk or a run if you can, or do something new and different. Some extraverts find it helpful to leave their devices in another room when they’re de-stressing. Keep in contact with others, and use video, not just voice. If you have introversion preferences, recharge by doing something that allows you time to reflect or that you can become absorbed in. Establish a quiet area of your home where you can work and/or retreat to. Try to limit online meetings, but ensure that you have some contact with other people. If you have sensing preferences, stop and take a step back. Focus on the big picture; what’s important? To avoid getting lost in the details, keep in touch with other people and ask for their take on the situation. Don’t obsess with getting every little thing right or having a perfect home working environment. If you have intuition preferences, stop going through all the possibilities. Ground yourself in the moment. Try one thing at a time, and stick to it; if you are working at home, it can be easy to skip from one idea to another. If you have thinking preferences, consider your impact on others. For example, read through messages before you send them. The written communications of “thinking” individuals can be very direct and task-focused and may appear terse and impersonal to others. Without the benefit of face-to-face contact, they may be misunderstood. If you have feeling preferences, find a balance between supporting others and looking after your own needs. That can be difficult when you are worrying about the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on others, especially if your close friends and family are not around to help. Identify the supports you need and take conscious actions to attain them. If you have judging preferences, set boundaries with yourself and others regarding when you will and won’t use technology at home — but be flexible when things are urgent. Turning off your devices when you are not working will most likely lower your stress levels, so make it clear to others when you will and won’t be available. If the Covid-19 crisis meant that you suddenly had to change your routines, establish new ones. If you are working at home, keep “work” and “home” separate by having a designated work area and staying away from it outside of working hours. If you have perceiving preferences, you might be enjoying some aspects of working from home, such as the freedom to be flexible with your hours. But don’t expect others to necessarily feel the same. Avoid sending emails or requesting chats outside of normal working hours. And allow some time for other activities so that your workdays don’t become overly routine. Timeboxing, or converting your to-do list into blocks of time on your calendar, might help. Technology can empower people, but it can also make them feel enslaved. By thinking carefully about how and when to use it, you can find your own sweet spot. Amid the current crisis, that’s more important than ever.

"183",183,"https://hbr.org/2020/06/the-agile-family-meeting","work life.txt","After fifteen years of research on what makes for a happy family, the author stumbled upon a surprising idea: that techniques borrowed from agile development can work just as well for family meetings as they do at work. He recommends a weekly family meeting that is based around just three questions: What worked well in our family this week? What didn’t work well in our family this week? What will we agree to work on this week? This simple framework will help families manage the chaos, get along better, and reduce stress. At a moment when many families around the world are confined to home, climbing the walls, and are searching desperately for fresh techniques for managing their household chaos, one proven solution that my family, along with many others, uses comes from an unlikely source: agile development. It’s no secret that working parents face enormous pressures. Ellen Galinsky, of the Families and Work Institute, asked a thousand children, “If you were granted one wish about your parents, what would it be?” When she asked parents to predict what their children would say, the parents said: “Spending more time with us.” They were wrong.  The kids’ number 1 wish: that their parents were less tired and less stressed. So how can we reduce that stress and help families to become happier? I spent the last 15 years trying to answer that question, meeting families, scholars, and experts ranging from a founder of the Harvard Negotiation Project to online game designers to Warren Buffett’s bankers. I published my finding in the bestselling book The Secrets of Happy Families and have found myself doubling down on many of those ideas in this time of flux of stress. The single best solution I found may be the simplest of all: hold regular family meetings to discuss how you’re managing your family. A few years ago, my research brought me to the Starr family home in Hidden Springs, Idaho. The Starrs are an ordinary American family with their share of ordinary American family issues. David is a software developer; Eleanor is a stay-at-home mom. At the time, their four children ranged in age from 10 to 15. Like many parents, the Starrs were trapped in that endless tension between the sunny, smooth-running household they aspired to be living in and the exhausting, ear-splitting one they were actually living in. “I tried the whole ‘love them and everything will work out’ philosophy,” Eleanor said. “but it wasn’t working. ‘For the love God,’ I said, ‘I can’t take this anymore.’” What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising. Instead of turning to their parents, their peers, or even a professional, they looked to David’s workplace. Specifically, to a philosophy of business problem solving that David had studied and taught: agile development. The techniques worked so well for their family that David wrote a white paper about it, and the idea spread from there. When my wife, Linda, and I adopted this blueprint into our home, weekly family meetings quickly became the single most impactful idea we introduced into our lives since the birth of our children. The idea of agile was invented in the 1980s in large measure through the leadership of Jeff Sutherland. A former fighter pilot in Vietnam, Sutherland was chief technologist at a financial firm in New England when he began noticing how dysfunctional software development was. Companies followed the “waterfall model,” in which executives issued ambitious orders from above that then flowed down to harried programmers below. “Eighty-three percent of projects came in late, over budget, or failed entirely,” Sutherland told me. Sutherland designed a new system, in which ideas flowed not just down from the top but up from the bottom and groups were designed to react to changes in real time. The centerpiece is the weekly meeting that’s built around shared decision making, open communication, and constant adaptability. Such meetings are easy to replicate in families. In my home, we started when our twin daughters were five and chose Sunday afternoons. Everyone gathers around the breakfast table; we open with a short, ritualistic drum tapping on the table; then, following the agile model, we ask three questions. From the very beginning, the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters’ mouths. What worked well in our family this week? “Getting over our fears of riding a bike,” “We’ve been doing much better making our beds.” What went wrong? “Doing our math sheets,” “Greeting visitors at the door.” Like most parents, we found our children to be something of a Bermuda Triangle: words and thoughts would go in, but few ever came out. Their emotional lives were invisible to us. The family meeting provided that rare window into their innermost thoughts. The most satisfying moments came when we turned to the topic of what we would work on during the coming week. The girls loved this part of the process, particularly selecting their own rewards and punishments. Say hello to five people this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed. Kick someone, lose dessert for a month. Turns out they were little Stalins. Naturally, there was a gap between the girls’ off-the-charts maturity during theses 20-minute sessions and their behavior the rest of the week, but that didn’t seem to matter. It felt to us as if we were laying massive underground cables that wouldn’t fully light up their world for many years to come. Ten years later, we still holding these family meetings every Sunday. Linda counts them as among her most-treasured moments as a mom. So what did we learn? 1. Empower the children. Our instinct as parents is to issue orders to our children. We think we know best; it’s easier; who has time to argue? And besides, we’re usually right! There’s a reason few systems have been more “waterfall” than the family. But as all parents quickly discover, telling your kids the same thing over and over is not necessarily the best tactic. The single biggest lesson we learned from our experience with agile practices is to reverse the waterfall as often as possible. Enlist the children whenever possible in their own upbringing. Brain research backs up this conclusion. Scientists at the University of California and elsewhere found kids who plan their own time, set weekly goals, and evaluate their own work build up their prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain that help them exert greater cognitive control over their lives. These so-called “executive skills” aid children with self-discipline, avoiding distraction, and weighing the pros and cons of their choices.  By participating in their own rewards and punishment, children become more intrinsically motivated. 2. Parents aren’t infallible. Another instinct we have as parents is to build ourselves up, to be Mr. or Ms. Fix-it. But abundant evidence suggests type of leadership is no longer the best model. Researchers have found that the most effective business teams are not dominated by a charismatic leader. Rather, members of particularly effective teams spend as much time talking to one another as to the leader, meet face to face regularly, and everyone speaks in equal measure. Sound familiar? “One thing that works in family meetings,” David Starr told me, “is the kids are allowed to say whatever they want, even about the grownups. If I’ve come back from a trip and am having trouble reentering the routine, or if mom hasn’t been nice that week, this is a safe venue to express their frustration.” 3. Build in flexibility. Another assumption parents often make is that we have to create a few overarching rules and stick to them indefinitely. This philosophy presumes we can anticipate every problem that will arise over many years. We can’t. A central tenet of the tech sector is if you’re doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago, you’re doing something wrong. Parents can learn a lot from that idea. The agile family philosophy accepts and embraces the ever-changing nature of family life. It’s certainly not lax; think of all the public accountability. And it’s not anything goes. But it anticipates that even the best designed system will need to be re-engineered midstream. *** As I was leaving the Starrs’ home, I asked Eleanor what’s the most important lesson I should learn from the first agile family. “In the media, families just are,” she said. “But that’s misleading. You have your job; you work on that. You have your garden, your hobbies, you work on those. Your family requires just as much work. The most important thing agile taught me is that you have to make a commitment to always keep working to improve your family.” What’s the secret to a happy family, in whatever situation you find yourself and whatever kind of stress you face? Try."

No one will do it perfectly. The key is to reset expectations and follow four simple principles: go for happy, not perfect; accept mistakes with curiosity; do what makes sense for you; and find time for laughter. We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. “I don’t know how you do it.” Whether it comes at the start of a videoconference or a call, this is one of the most frequent comments I hear from clients, colleagues, and even friends these days as we’re doing our usual pre-meeting check ins. The statement always surprises me. I’m a professor who teaches and a consultant who advises various organizations, now virtually. I am a researcher, engaged with colleagues on several projects. I am a partner, married to a committed working spouse, trying to be creative about having fun dates during lockdown. I am the mom of four children: the oldest is seven; the youngest is just over six months old. When I hear “I don’t know how you do it,” my answer is “I don’t!” — at least not perfectly and sometimes not even well. Like me, many working adults across the globe have been juggling a lot since the Covid-19 crisis started. I’ve heard many people complain about their difficult realities and bad experiences, and certainly many — including frontline workers, those infected by the virus, and now those traumatized by recent racist incidents — are facing extreme challenges. But, for those of us managing more minor struggles, I’ve come to believe that the difference between going to bed feeling content or disappointed at the end of the day has a lot to do with the expectations we set for ourselves. Let’s lower our standards. Better yet: Let’s use this moment to shift them to something more reasonable. Here is how I’ve done it, by focusing on four simple principles. A lot of us can identify with — and have benefited from — the desire to be perfect. But we often take it too far. Even before the pandemic, research by personality psychologists Thomas Curran and Andrew Hill found that growing numbers of people were struggling to match unreachable ideals. The two psychologists studied more than 40,0000 American, British, and Canadian college students between 1989 and 2016 and  found that perfectionism has increased dramatically over the last few decades — 33% since 1989. We seem to be internalizing a contemporary myth that life should be perfect, when, in fact, that is an impossible outcome and can contribute to serious anxiety and depression. Those who become preoccupied with perfection set themselves up for failure and psychological turmoil. Instead of aiming for perfection, we need to aim for happiness. I remind myself that this is the goal every single day. I’m patient if it takes me longer than expected to get work done. And, at the dinner table every evening, I ask my little ones to talk about what made them happy and what they feel grateful for that day. In the middle of a busy night at the celebrated restaurant Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, one of the sous chefs, Taka, jumped in to make desserts after the pastry chef’s abrupt departure. As he assembled some lemon tarts, one accidentally fell to the ground. Taka froze as the restaurant’s chef and owner, Massimo Bottura, saw the mess. But instead of getting upset, Bottura was inspired. Today, one of the most popular deserts on the restaurant’s menu is called “Oops! I dropped the lemon tart.” It is carefully constructed to look like a mess: A light and foamy zabaglione is splashed over lemon cubes, bergamot jelly, spiced apple, a few drops of chili and lemon oil, and honeyed capers from an island off the coast of Sicily, and it’s topped by a lemongrass sorbet and a broken biscuit. These days, I take solace in this story. Rarely do my days go as planned. One of my four children may unexpectedly interrupt a work Zoom call, or some emergency requires me to drop a paper in the middle of a sentence — even when it turns out the yelling across the floors was simply prompted by me preparing a different lunch than I had promised. I am striving to be more like Bottura, looking at mistakes and accidents with a curious mind. Another impressive person I met while working on my latest book, Rebel Talent, is Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, who managed to land a commercial aircraft safely in the Hudson River on a cold January day in 2009 when both engines failed. Sully looked beyond the most obvious option (landing at the nearest airport) to come up with a more creative and promising solution. Especially when we’re under pressure, we narrow in on what immediately seems like the best course of action. But a better approach is to contemplate a wide range of options and perspectives. Take all the advice we hear about the importance of getting a good night’s sleep to our health and well-being. Well, I can’t remember the last time I slept for more than a few uninterrupted hours or beyond 6 AM, due to nightmares, trips to the bathroom with one of my oldest three, or my four-year old strangely announcing she can’t find her bed at 3 AM. And that’s ok: I now laugh at the recommendations on sleep, since they clearly don’t apply to me right now. I have colleagues who, they tell me, have never been more productive than now. I have friends who have never been in better shape or better rested. That has not been my experience in lockdown, and that’s okay. I smile at their accomplishments and laugh at the fact that exercise, these days, is often running around the house after my kids. That brings me to my last principle. Everyone enjoys a good laugh, but who actually makes time for it, especially when the news is so horrifying? We all may agree that listening to a funny joke, talking to people with a good sense of humor, and watching comedies are all pleasant activities, but do we block out space in our calendar for them? Especially during crises we should do just that because amusement has lots of benefits. According to a 2015 study, the act of laughing makes us more open to new people and helps us build relationships. It can also help us regulate our emotions in the face of challenge, according to a study led by Yale psychologist Erica J. Boothby. Laughter can improve our health and make us better learners. And what’s more: laughter is contagious. Despite all the negativity in the today’s news, it shouldn’t take much to find something to laugh at. When, this morning, I repeatedly asked my three-year-old to please put her underwear on before going outside and then found my four-year-old painting herself instead of a canvas, I let myself laugh rather than getting upset. After a couple of weeks in lockdown, my husband and I noticed that we would sometimes find ourselves on a short fuse, snapping with criticism that didn’t really need to be aired. Our solution? We decided that if one of us wanted to criticize the other (e.g., “You could have put the dishes in the dishwasher rather than leaving them in the sink”), we would do so while dancing in a goofy manner, turning a stressful moment into a light-hearted one. So many situations are out of our control. But we do have choices about how we approach each day and the expectations we set for ourselves.

"185",185,"https://hbr.org/2020/04/3-tips-to-avoid-wfh-burnout","work life.txt","As millions of employees around the world have had to make a sudden and unprecedented shift to remote work amid the coronavirus pandemic, many might find themselves feeling like they need to work all the time to signal their devotion and productivity — and, as a result, may struggle to create healthy boundaries.  Even more than before, afternoons will blend with evenings, and weekdays will blend with weekend days, leaving a sense of little time off. So, how can we “leave our work at the door” if we are no longer going out the door? Research shows it will be important to: 1) maintain physical and social boundaries; 2) maintain boundaries on how you use your time; and 3) focus on your most important work. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Millions around the globe have made a sudden transition to remote work amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, this has some employers concerned about maintaining employee productivity. But what they really should be concerned about in this unprecedented situation is a longer-term risk: employee burnout. The risk is substantial. The lines between work and non-work are blurring in new and unusual ways, and many employees who are working remotely for the first time are likely to struggle to preserve healthy boundaries between their professional and personal lives. To signal their loyalty, devotion, and productivity, they may feel they have to work all the time. Afternoons will blend with evenings; weekdays will blend with weekends; and little sense of time off will remain. It’s possible that some employees may be asked to continue working remotely for several months. Lots of research suggests that drawing lines between our professional and personal lives is crucial, especially for our mental health. But it’s difficult, even in the best of circumstances. In no small measure, that’s because the knowledge economy has radically transformed what it means to be an “ideal worker.” Our research has shown that workers often unintentionally make it hard for their supervisors, colleagues, and employees to maintain boundaries. One way they do so is by sending work emails outside office hours. In five studies involving more than 2,000 working adults, we found that senders of after-hours work emails underestimate how compelled receivers feel to respond right away, even when such emails are not urgent. Covid-19 might amplify these pressures. Even for employees who have a natural preference to separate their work and personal lives, the current circumstances may not allow them to do so. Many schools are closed, and daycare may no longer be an option, placing additional burdens on working parents or low-income workers. Even companies that already encourage employees to work from home are likely to have some trouble supporting employees who face the many challenges of working at home in the presence of their families. So how can employees continue to compartmentalize their work and non-work lives, given the extraordinary situation that so many of us are in today? How can we “leave our work at the door” if we are no longer going out the door? What can employers, managers, and coworkers do to help one another cope? Based on our research and the wider academic literature, here are some recommendations: Maintain physical and social boundaries In a classic paper, Blake Ashforth, of Arizona State University, described the ways in which people demarcate the transition from work to non-work roles via “boundary-crossing activities.” Putting on your work clothes, commuting from home to work—these are physical and social indicators that something has changed. You’ve transitioned from “home you” to “work you.” Try to maintain these boundaries when working remotely. In the short-term, it may be a welcome change not to have to catch an early train to work, or to be able to spend all day in your pajamas—but both of those things are boundary-crossing activities that can do you good, so don’t abandon them altogether. Put on your work clothes every morning—casual Friday is fine, of course, but get yourself ready nonetheless. And consider replacing your morning commute with a walk to a nearby park, or even just around your apartment, before sitting down to work. Some workers have already come up with creative and lighthearted ways to maintain their usual work routines. Maintain temporal boundaries as much as possible Maintaining temporal boundaries is critical for well-being and work engagement. This is particularly true when so many employees—and/or their colleagues—are now facing the challenge of integrating childcare or elder-care responsibilities during regular work hours. It’s challenging even for employees without children or other family responsibilities, thanks to the mobile devices that keep our work with us at all times. Sticking to a 9-to-5 schedule may prove unrealistic. Employees need to find work-time budgets that function best for them. They also need be conscious and respectful that others might work at different times than they do. For some it might be a child’s nap, for others it might be when their partner is cooking dinner. Employees with or without children can create intentional work-time budgets by adding an “out of office” reply during certain hours of the day to focus on work. A less-extreme reply might be to just let others know that you might be slower than usual in responding, decreasing response expectations for others and yourself. Creating clear temporal boundaries often depends on the ability to coordinate ones’ time with others. This calls for leaders to aid employees in structuring, coordinating, and managing the pace of work. This might mean regularly holding virtual check-in virtual meetings with employees, or providing them with tools to create virtual coffee or workspaces. Through this disruption, keeping a sense of normality is key. Focus on your most important work This is not the time for busy work. Workers should be devoting their energy to top-priority issues. While working from home, employees often feel compelled to project the appearance of productivity, but this can lead them to work on tasks that are more immediate instead of more important—a tendency that research suggests is counterproductive in the long run, even if it benefits productivity in the short run. Employees, particularly those facing increased workloads as they juggle family and work tasks, should pay attention to prioritizing important work. Working all the time, even on your most important tasks, isn’t the answer. According to some estimates, the average knowledge worker is only productive on average three hours every day, and these hours should be free of interruptions or multitasking. Even before Covid-19, employees found it difficult to carve out three continuous hours to focus on their core work tasks. With work and family boundaries being removed, employees’ time has never been more fragmented. Employees who feel “on” all the time are at a higher risk of burnout when working from home than if they were going to the office as usual. In the long-term, trying to squeeze in work and email responses whenever we have a few minutes to do so —during nap time, on the weekend, or by pausing a movie in the evening—is not only counterproductive but also detrimental to our well-being. We all need to find new ways—and help others do the same—to carve out non-work time and mental space. These are just a few recommendations that can help workers maintain boundaries between their work and their personal life and thereby avoid burnout in the long run. Employees will need the flexibility to experiment with how to make their circumstances work for them in these unpredictable times.

But when it comes to our time, we hardly give it a second thought. The good news is that there are easy ways to take some of your time back. Process-oriented tasks that can’t be automated should at the very least be delegated or outsourced. If it’s a low-risk, repeatable, non-complex task that somebody else can do for you at fraction of what your hourly rate is, why are you still doing it? Most decisions are reversible and should be made quickly. If it’s not necessary to have a meeting (it’s usually not), use asynchronous communication tools; the reality is that most things don’t require an immediate response. While you’ll initially have to spend some time to make time, like compound interest, over the long-term, you will save exponentially more time than you invest. We’re all busy — so busy. We have bills to pay, a mortgage to service, kids to take care of, and of course, work deadlines to meet. All of these commitments leave us with little meaningful time for ourselves, and for cultivating meaningful relationships with others. But the good news is: When we say we’re time-poor, what we really mean is that we’re decision-poor. And that’s something we can change. Most of us are incredibly careful about how we spend our money. But when it comes to our time, we hardly give it a second thought. We say yes to all sorts of nonsensical requests for our time; we treat everything as urgent; we attend pointless meetings; we refuse to delegate work for fear that quality will be compromised; we spend our days tethered to our inboxes and our smartphones; and we stubbornly continue to perform tasks that a machine could do for us. Unlike money though, time can’t be earned back. It’s easy to derive a sense of identity or status from the hustle, but what’s it ultimately for? As palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware noted in her book, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, one of the biggest regrets that people had on their deathbeds was that they’d worked too hard. Step one toward joining the new rich — those who use their time wisely, and thus have the luxury of more free time — is believing in the paradox that we can actually get more done in less time, as I wrote in “The Case for the 6-Hour Workday.” Refusing to believe this is to resign yourself to a life of staring at screens for eleven hours a day. It’s your choice. If you choose to take back your time, here’s how to get started: Nowadays, all kinds of tasks can be automated. Sadly, too few entrepreneurs and business executives are taking advantage of the multitude of affordable and simple, yet effective, tools on the market. Here’s a non-exhaustive snapshot of what can be automated: Tools you can start using today: Process-oriented tasks that can’t be automated should at the very least be delegated or outsourced. If it’s a low-risk, repeatable, non-complex task that somebody else can do for you at fraction of what your hourly rate is, why are you still doing it? In an episode of the popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant suggested setting an aspirational hourly rate for yourself and sticking to it. “Never do anything with your time for less than that amount — whether it’s attending a meeting or returning a package from Amazon…If I have to return something, and it costs less than my personal hourly rate, I’ll give it away.” Having worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs, I often show them the table below, created by author Perry Marshall, and ask, “What percentage of your time do you spend on $10-an-hour tasks?” “About half my time” is the usual response. When I press people to outsource, they respond without a hint of irony: “I don’t have time to do that!” You have to spend time to make time, but like compound interest, in the long-term, you will save exponentially more time than you invest. “But it only takes me a few minutes a day to do it!” Even a task that takes you 5 minutes a day, 5 times a day, adds up to 15 workdays per year, not even accounting for the cognitive switching costs. To outsource more low-value tasks, try tools such as: “It’s a necessary evil.” These were the words of a former manager of mine at a leading Australian bank. I had asked why 12 people had to be present for periodic three-hours-long meeting when 10 of them each had no more than five minutes of worthwhile contributions to make. It wasn’t a necessary evil, it was just inefficient and unproductive. This lack of ownership, and tendency to outsource accountability by way of multi-person, multi-hours-long meetings and reply-all email trails leaves company productivity stagnant and employee morale low. A better approach is the “I’ll get to it when it suits me” philosophy that is at the core of asynchronous communication. The reality is that most things don’t require an immediate response, and that meetings shouldn’t be used merely to communicate information; we have email and instant messaging for that. If a discussion is warranted, then try scheduling shorter meetings, in 15- or 30-minute increments, instead of the obligatory hour which is still the default at most organizations today. And if it’s not necessary to have a meeting (it’s usually not), try one of these asynchronous communication tools: It’s hard to talk about asynchronous communication without referring to what Amazon’s Jeff Bezos calls Type 1 and Type 2 decisions: Type 1 decisions are big, hairy, irreversible, and high-stakes. Type 2 decisions are reversible. If you screw up, you can make amends without too much, if any, harm having been caused. Most of our decisions are Type 2 decisions, and they should be made quickly. The fewer decisions that are treated as Type 1 decisions, the less time will get eaten up with meetings and communications. Multi-tasking is a myth, and task-switching leaves us unproductive and exhausted, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t bundle tasks. Katherine Milkman, a behavioral economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, coined the term “temptation bundling.” It refers to bundling things you want to do with things you need to do, to help you build positive habits. Let’s say my physiotherapist asked me to incorporate 30 minutes of mobility training into my day, three times a week. I could do this in isolation, or I could combine it with something I want to do like watching a documentary on YouTube, or even taking a call on speaker. By making fewer excuses, and investing the time required to design our work and personal lives, not only can we join the new rich, but we can cultivate a more meaningful and less regrettable life. As Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca put it, “Life is long if you know how to use it.”"
"187",187,"https://hbr.org/2020/05/want-to-be-more-productive-try-doing-less","work life.txt","If we want to ramp up our productivity and happiness at home and at work, we should actually be doing less. But that’s incredibly difficult as you’re balancing work, parenting, friendships, and more. When you stop doing the things that make you feel busy but aren’t getting you results, then you end up with more than enough time for what matters. You can follow a simple exercise to help decide what activities on your to-do list brings you the most value, and which you can stop doing. Decide on an area of your life where you’d like to have better results and less stress. Write down the tasks you do in that area on one side of a piece of paper, and on the other, list successes you’ve had in that area. Then, identify which tasks directly contributed to those successes. Anything that didn’t directly contribute can be eliminated, greatly reduced, or delegated to someone else. We’ve been taught that if we want more — money, achievement, vitality, joy, peace of mind — we need to do more, to add more to our ever-growing to-do list. But what if we’ve been taught wrong? What if the answer to getting more of what we want isn’t addition at all, but subtraction? As it turns out, evidence supports that if we want to ramp up our productivity and happiness, we should actually be doing less. David Rock, author of Your Brain at Work, found that we’re truly focused on our work a mere six hours per week, which starkly contrasts our collective buy-in to the 40-hour workweek. When you stop doing the things that make you feel busy but aren’t getting you results (and are draining you of energy), then you end up with more than enough time for what matters and a sense of peace and spaciousness that constant activity has kept outside your reach. As people with full lives — kids, careers, friends, passions, logistics, and more — how can we apply the wisdom of doing less to give ourselves more time and alleviate stress without jeopardizing our results? We need to identify what not to do. But this determination can’t be random. It must be methodical and evidence-based. Through my work with women navigating the dual vocations of entrepreneurship and motherhood, I’ve created a surprisingly simple exercise to help individuals decide what activities on their to-do list bring them the most value, and which they can stop doing. Here’s how it works: Step 1: Draw a line down the middle of a piece of paper, lengthwise. Step 2: Decide on an area of your life or work where you’d like to have better results and less stress. For example, perhaps you want to expand your thought leadership. Step 3: On the left-hand side, list the tasks or activities you do in that area of your work or life. As an aspiring thought leader, you might list attending conferences, pitching organizations for speaking opportunities, writing new articles, reading and researching, and so on. Step 4: On the right-hand side, make a list of your biggest “wins” in that area, like a speaking gig, a presentation you really nailed at work, or a pitch that was accepted at a major publication. This can often be a difficult step for some people. We have not been culturally conditioned to celebrate ourselves, so often, folks will draw a blank when listing their “wins.” Any result you’ve gotten (either one time or repeatedly) that was positive can go on this list. Don’t get caught up in listing the “right” things. Just list what comes to you. Step 5: Draw a line connecting each of your biggest wins to the activity or task that was most responsible for that result. Reading and researching, for instance, were essential to getting your pitch accepted for publication, so connect these two together. Step 6: Circle all the activities and tasks on the left side of your paper that have been responsible for your big wins. Look at what’s left. Whatever isn’t circled is something that you need to either stop doing completely, significantly minimize, or delegate if it absolutely must be done. For instance, if you discover that traveling for conferences once a month isn’t directly contributing to any wins, it’s time to set that aside or at least cut back. This same approach can be used to determine where to do less in other areas of your life. For instance, if you’re looking to connect more with your children, you might list a few specific memories or “wins” when you really felt like you were being the best parent you could, such as singing silly songs with your preschooler while folding the laundry on a Sunday morning or when your preteen bared their soul to you and you felt so honored by how safe they felt to tell you the hard stuff. Now think about the tasks you do on a regular basis: laundry, making lunch, reminding your kids to do their schoolwork, checking off committee items for the PTA, making sure everyone has clothes that fit, and scheduling pediatrician appointments. While these tasks may need to be done, this exercise can give us permission to spend less time on these activities. Often the things we think we “must” do are simply because we always have done them or others around us do them and we think we should, too. Such a perspective creates unnecessary stress when we do these tasks late, make errors, or ask for help. Maybe instead of serving on the PTA, you can just attend the occasional meeting — or follow up with another parent who regularly attends. Perhaps you can set up a system where your children are in charge of making sure their schoolwork is done by a particular time each day, rather than reminding them yourself. On the other hand, if you discover that making lunch with your preteen provided that opportunity for them to initiate a heart-to-heart, maybe that’s something you’d like to keep on your list. Repeat this exercise for as many areas of your life that you’d like to enhance through subtraction. Be ruthless. And don’t forget to consider what brings you joy. Not only does happiness make you at least 12% more productive, it’s also what makes life worth living in the first place. Life is not about racking up a list of accomplishments. What can you stop doing to make more time for yourself, make more time for joy, and use your time more meaningfully? The next time you set a goal or decide you want to improve upon an area of your life — or simply alleviate some of the pain that area is causing you — remember to go for subtraction instead of addition. Revel in the joy of doing less."
"188",188,"https://hbr.org/2020/03/whats-really-holding-women-back","work life.txt","Ask people to explain why women remain so dramatically underrepresented in the senior ranks of most companies, and you will hear from the vast majority a lament that goes something like this: High-level jobs require extremely long hours, women’s devotion to family makes it impossible to put in those hours, and so their careers inevitably suffer. Not so, say the authors, who spent 18 months working with a global consulting firm that wanted to know why it had so few women in positions of power. Although virtually every employee the authors interviewed related a form of the standard explanation, the firm’s data told a different story. Women weren’t being held back because of trouble balancing work and family; men, too, suffered from that problem and nevertheless advanced. Women were held back because they were encouraged to take accommodations, such as going part-time and shifting to internally facing roles, which derailed their careers. The real culprit in women’s stalled advancement, the authors conclude, is a general culture of overwork that hurts both sexes and locks gender equality in place. To solve this problem, they argue, we must reconsider what we’re willing to allow the workplace to demand of all employees. To explain why women are still having trouble accessing positions of power and authority in the workplace, many observers point to the challenge of managing the competing demands of work and family. But the data doesn’t support that narrative. The authors conducted a long-term study of beliefs and practices at a global consulting firm. The problem, they found, was not the work/family challenge itself but a general culture of overwork in which women were encouraged to take career-derailing accommodations to meet the demands of work and family. This culture of overwork punishes not just women but also men, although to a lesser degree. Only by recognizing and addressing the problem as one that affects all employees will we have a chance of achieving workplace equality. As scholars of gender inequality in the  workplace, we are routinely asked by companies to investigate why they are having trouble retaining women and promoting them to senior ranks. It’s a pervasive problem. Women made remarkable progress accessing positions of power and authority in the 1970s and 1980s, but that progress slowed considerably in the 1990s and has stalled completely in this century.   Ask people why women remain so dramatically underrepresented, and you will hear from the vast majority a lament—an unfortunate but inevitable “truth”—that goes something like this: High-level jobs require extremely long hours, women’s devotion to family makes it impossible for them to put in those hours, and their careers suffer as a result. We call this explanation the work/family narrative. In a 2012 survey of more than 6,500 Harvard Business School alumni from many different industries, 73% of men and 85% of women invoked it to explain women’s stalled advancement. Believing this explanation doesn’t mean it’s true, however, and our research calls it seriously into question. We heard this explanation a few years ago from a global consulting firm that, having had no success with off-the-shelf solutions, sought our help in understanding how its culture might be hampering its women employees. The firm recruits from elite colleges and MBA programs and ranks near the top of lists of prestigious consultancies, but like most other professional services firms, it has few female partners. We worked with the firm for 18 months, during which time we interviewed 107 consultants—women and men, partners and associates. Virtually everybody resorted to some version of the work/family narrative to explain the paucity of female partners. But as we reported last year with our colleague Erin Reid, the more time we spent with people at the firm, the more we found that their explanations didn’t correspond with the data. Women weren’t held back because of trouble balancing the competing demands of work and family—men, too, suffered from the balance problem and nevertheless advanced. Women were held back because, unlike men, they were encouraged to take accommodations, such as going part-time and shifting to internally facing roles, which derailed their careers. The real culprit was a general culture of overwork that hurt both men and women and locked gender inequality in place. On several dimensions, the firm’s data revealed a reality very different from the story employees told us—and were telling themselves. The disconnects we observed made us question why the story had such a powerful grip—even on the firm’s data-minded analysts, who should have recognized it as a fiction. Consider retention. Although one of the firm’s motives for reaching out to us was that it wanted help addressing “women’s higher turnover rate,” when we took a careful look at its data for the preceding three years, we discovered virtually no difference in turnover rates for women and men. Another disconnect: Whereas firm members attributed distress over work/family conflict primarily to women, we found that many men were suffering, too. “I was traveling three days a week and seeing my children once or twice a week for 45 minutes before they went to bed,” one told us. He recalled a particularly painful Saturday when he told his son he couldn’t come to his soccer game. “He burst into tears,” the man said. “I wanted to quit then and there.” Two-thirds of the associates we talked to who were fathers reported this kind of work/family conflict, but only one was taking accommodations to ease it. Accommodations were another area in which the firm’s narrative and its data didn’t line up. Employees who took advantage of them—virtually all of whom were women—were stigmatized and saw their careers derailed. The upshot for women at the individual level was sacrifices in power, status, and income; at the collective level, it meant the continuation of a pattern in which powerful positions remained the purview of men. Perversely, in its attempt to solve the problem of women’s stalled advancement, the firm was perpetuating it. We also found incongruities within the work/family rhetoric itself. Take the way this man summed up the problem: “Women are going to have kids and not want to work, or they are going to have kids and might want to work but won’t want to travel every week and live the lifestyle that consulting requires, of 60- or 70-hour weeks.” Resolute in his conviction that women’s personal preferences were the obstacle to their success, he was unable to account for such anomalies as childless women, whose promotion record was no better than that of mothers. In his calculation all women were mothers, a conflation that was common in our interviews. Childless women figured nowhere in people’s remarks, perhaps because they contradict the work/family narrative. In a final disconnect, many of those we spoke with described experiences that called into question the work/family narrative’s foundational premise: that 24/7 work schedules are unavoidable. They talked about devoting long hours to practices that were costly and unnecessary, chief among them overselling and overdelivering. We heard many stories of partners who, as one associate put it, “promise the client the moon” without thinking of how much time and energy it takes to deliver on such promises. The pitch goes like this, he explained: “We’ll do X, Y, and Z, and we’re going to do it all in half the time that you think it should take.” Clients are wowed and can’t wait to sign up, he told us. Associates felt pressured to go along with these demands for overwork because they wanted to stand out as stars amid their highly qualified colleagues. ‘‘We do these crazy slide decks that take hours and hours of work,” one said. “It’s this attitude of, ‘I’m going to kill the client with a 100-slide deck.’ But the client can’t use all that!’’ Another associate ruefully described all the weekends she had devoted to these sorts of tasks. “I just worked really, really hard,” she told us, “and sacrificed family stuff, sacrificed my health for it, and at the end of the day, I look back on it, ‘Well, did we really have to do that? Probably not.’” We pointed out these disconnects to the firm’s leaders, challenging the work/family narrative as oversimplified and offering a broader, more-nuanced, and data-driven explanation: What really held women back was the crushing culture of overwork at the firm. The unnecessarily long hours were detrimental to everyone, we explained, but they disproportionately penalized women because, unlike men, many of them take accommodations, which exact a steep career price. All this led us to what we felt was an inescapable conclusion: For the firm to address its gender problem, it would have to address its long-hours problem. And the way to start would be to stop overselling and overdelivering. The leaders reacted negatively to this feedback. They continued to maintain that women were failing to advance because they had difficulty balancing work and family, and they insisted that any solution had to target women specifically. Unable to convince them otherwise, we were at a loss for how to help, and the engagement effectively ended. To address its gender issue, the firm would have to address its long-hours issue. But we kept thinking about the situation. The firm’s leaders were smart, empirically minded, and well-meaning, and yet they had dismissed the data and clung reflexively to an empirically dubious belief in the work/family narrative. As thoughtful as they were, it was a puzzle why they continued to rely on a “solution” that only perpetuated the problem. The firm was not atypical in this regard. Research shows that a 24/7 culture creates discontent for women and men alike and that the “accommodations” solution, ironically, tends to derail the careers of highly qualified women, leaving companies’ senior ranks depleted of some of their brightest female stars. Studies show an additional irony: Long hours don’t raise productivity. In fact, they have been associated with decreases in performance and increases in sick-leave costs. Considering those downsides, we asked: Why do companies continue on the same work/life balance path and disregard the possibility of instituting more-humane work hours? We suspected that in the answer lay something profound but hidden—not just at our client firm but in corporate culture generally. Perhaps the work/family narrative is so pervasive and tenacious because it feeds into an elaborate system of social and psychological defenses that protect both women and men from the disturbing emotions that arise from the demand for long work hours. We decided to investigate. We returned to our interviews, this time paying special attention not only to what interviewees had said (or hadn’t) but also to how they had said it. The exercise was illuminating. Consciously or unconsciously, virtually all the employees we had talked to revealed that they were emotionally conflicted by the firm’s relentless demand for 24/7 availability and the daily choices that demand forced them to make between family and work. The unease thus created set the stage for protective measures to kick in—measures that would keep the firm’s leaders from having to face up to the devil’s choice they were handing their employees, and employees from having to face up to the price of whichever choice they made. The linchpin of those protective measures was a belief in women’s natural fitness for family, and in men’s for work. At the employee level, they appeared as unconscious psychological defense mechanisms that reinforced the gendered work/family split. At the organizational level, they emerged as the universally held belief in the work/family narrative and in the form of policies that, as with accommodations, effectively took women off the partnership path. These employee-level and firm-level dynamics operated together to create the firm’s social defense system. All parties benefited from these measures in the short run. Firm leaders could deflect responsibility for the lack of women partners on the grounds that it was inescapable. Employees could make some semblance of peace with their decisions: Men could justify as inevitable the sacrifices they’d made in ratcheting up at work, and women could justify as natural the sacrifices they’d made in ratcheting down. And all the while, the firm’s long-hours culture remained unchallenged. But as with all defensive maneuvers, this social defense system didn’t fully work. Conflict relegated to the unconscious merely hides; it isn’t resolved, and anxieties continually poke through to conscious awareness, experienced differently among women than among men. In a long-hours work culture, men have one primary identity: that of an ideal worker, fully committed and fully available. To fit this image, they must adopt the psychological stance of “my job is all-important.” Nonwork identities, no matter how personally meaningful, become contingent and secondary. Naturally, this imperative to be an ideal worker generates internal conflict, especially for parents. The men we talked to clearly felt guilty about how little time they spent with their families. They spoke poignantly about their deep emotional attachment to them, told us how much they regretted the time spent away from them, and described in heart-wrenching detail their interactions with disappointed children. Men employed one key psychological tactic to manage these emotions: They split off their guilt and sadness, projected those feelings onto women at the firm, and identified with them there, at a bit of a remove. Consider the psychological jujitsu one man performed as he drew on the work/family narrative to explain women’s lack of advancement in the firm. “I believe deeply in my heart and soul that women encounter different challenges,” he said. “There’s the collusion of society that it’s the woman who takes the extended maternity leave, and there are some biological imperatives, too. When my first child was born, I got to carry her from the delivery room to the nursery. It’s almost like I could feel the chemicals releasing in my brain. I fell so chemically, deeply, in love with my daughter. I couldn’t imagine a world without her. I mean, here it was in [just] the first eight minutes of her life. So I can understand, ‘How can I possibly give this up and go back to work?’” But back to work he went. And what was his takeaway from this emotionally charged experience? A sense that he better understood the difficulties women face in trying to balance work and family! To banish his guilt and sadness about returning to his highly demanding workweeks, he projected his intense emotional experience onto the women at the firm—a move that allowed him to let go of those feelings while still identifying with them. Let’s unpack his story. He started with a distinction between women and men, linking motherhood to biology. It is women, not men, he suggested, who have the parenting experience. He abruptly changed course to speak about his own intensely emotional and biologically determined parenting experience but then changed course again, distancing himself from that experience and projecting it onto women. In effect, he was saying, “I was having this experience, but it was transient, and now that I’ve sampled it, now that I’ve been a tourist in this emotional land, I have a way to understand what is happening to women.” The emotions he had experienced, in other words, were no longer his. They now belonged to women. At that point he shifted the conversation to the male-dominated world of work. He told us about his time in the beer industry, a domain that, as he put it, consists of “men slapping each other on the back and talking about golf and s--- like that.” In his telling, there was no room in this domain for the emotional experience of parenting, which he implicitly relegated to the world of women. Men and women, he said, just have different commitments to work and family. “I can’t think of a single instance,” he told us, “where the fella took a six-month paternity leave to care for the baby while mom went back to work.” This man was not alone in setting up women as the organizational bearers of distress about curtailed family time. That psychological defense gave many men at the firm the illusion of a fulfilled life and enabled them to perform as the committed workers the firm valorized. But the defense was only a Band-Aid; reality—the on-the-ground, relentless demands of family—was not so easily banished. Women experience a different psychic tension. According to the work/family narrative and broader cultural notions, their commitment to family is primary by nature, so their commitment to work has to be secondary. They are expected to embrace an intensive, “my family is all-important” approach to parenting, a stance encouraged by the firm’s readily accessible accommodations. But a family-first stance comes at a significant cost to their careers and flies in the face of their professional ambitions. Most of the firm’s women had tasted professional success and resisted the idea that they belonged at home, which made this tension especially acute. They willingly complied with the family-devotion schema but struggled openly with the idea of splitting off the work component of their identities. One “push” factor was the poor reputation of female partners with children. That ambivalence is clear in the account of one mother, who talked about her inability to shirk responsibilities on the home front despite having a family-oriented husband. “There’s just a difference between the way a mother and a father look at their kids and the sense of responsibility that they feel,” she told us. “I feel my male counterparts can more easily disconnect from what’s happening at home….If I did sort of disconnect, things wouldn’t fall apart, but I wouldn’t feel good about it, so it’s just not going to happen.” Yet her work commitment was also strong, leaving her at a loss for knowing whether her family responsibilities would allow her the space to develop professionally. “I know I’ll fall down from time to time,” she said. “I know I need to learn…I don’t doubt myself….It’s more from a place of needing to learn and needing to grow. I doubt myself generally in being able to honor that while also honoring the commitments I’ve made to my family. That is a constant worry.” The ambivalence she felt about her career is on full display here. She embraced her family identity but was unwilling to relinquish her work identity, which is why she could say that she didn’t doubt herself but then go on to say that she did. Many other women at the firm similarly struggled with the work/family narrative’s injunction to reject the role of ambitious professional. This meant that they weren’t able to reap all its psychological benefits as a social defense. They willingly complied with the cultural dictate that they become the primary family caregiver, allowing men to identify vicariously with that split-off aspect of themselves—but they didn’t shed their work identities. Thus the psychological resolution that men found, having made the “right” choice in fully committing themselves to a work identity, was unavailable to women, who had made the “wrong” choice in not fully committing themselves to a family identity. Working women in this situation are left with identities constructed as contradictory, forcing them to constantly assess whether they should ratchet down their career aspirations. Adding to this tension at the firm were regular reminders that women were in the wrong place by being at work instead of at home—“push” factors that women had to withstand if they wanted to retain their work identities as ambitious professionals. One particularly strong push factor that women encounter is work/family accommodations. Going part-time or shifting to internally facing roles provides an enticing off-ramp from the path of overwork, but those moves stigmatize women and derail their careers. Female associates at the firm who took accommodations generally fell off the track to partner; female partners who took them veered away from the route to real power. Many women at the firm described having to resist a second push factor: the pressure to give up what they saw as their relational style in favor of the hard-charging “masculine” style the firm venerated in client interactions. One female partner told us how an early mentor warned that relying on her well-honed relationship-building skills would communicate to prospective clients that “you don’t have a lot going on between your ears.” In other words, her skill set didn’t cut the mustard. Such assessments loosened women’s identification with work while affirming a style more commonly associated with men, further encouraging women to step back. A third push factor was the poor reputation of female partners with children, whose mothering was roundly condemned. These were formidable women who had held fast to their professional identities and achieved much recognition and success—achievements contradicting the idea that it is impossible to meet the demands of both work and family. One could imagine their being held up as exemplars, but we heard them routinely described as bad mothers—“horrible” women who were not “positive role models of working moms.” For junior women facing decisions about being good mothers and having successful careers, such condemnation implies that professional commitment exacts a terrible cost. With these push factors constantly reminding women that they don’t really belong in the workplace, it’s no wonder that women are often ambivalent about their career commitments. When faced with the long-hours problem, they find themselves on the horns of a dilemma: If they respond to the pull of family by taking accommodations, they undermine their status at work, but if they refuse accommodations in favor of their professional ambitions, they undermine their status as good mothers. Thus they are positioned to be seen as subpar performers or subpar mothers—or both. This dilemma leaves the culture of overwork intact, allows firms to deflect responsibility for women’s stalled advancement, and locks gender inequality in place. Women are the ones who have a work/family problem to sort out, the story goes, and that’s just the way it is. Social defense systems are insidious. They divert attention from a core anxiety-provoking problem by introducing a less-anxiety-provoking one that can serve as a substitute focus. At our client firm, the core problem was the impossibly long work hours, and the substitute problem was the firm’s inability to promote women. By presenting work/family accommodations as the solution to the substitute problem, the firm added to an invisible and self-reinforcing social-defense system—one that cloaked inefficient work practices in the rhetoric of necessity while perpetuating gender disparities. This move gave firm leaders an unresolvable and therefore always available problem to worry about, which in turn allowed everybody to avoid confronting the core problem. As a result, two strongly held ideologies supporting the status quo remained in place: Long work hours are necessary, and women’s stalled advancement is inevitable. Our findings align with a growing consensus among gender scholars: What holds women back at work is not some unique challenge of balancing the demands of work and family but rather a general problem of overwork that prevails in contemporary corporate culture. Women and men alike suffer as a result. But women pay higher professional costs. If we want to solve this problem, we must reconsider what we’re willing to allow the workplace to demand of all employees. Such a reconsideration is possible. As individual families and employees push back against overwork, they will pave the way for others to follow. And as more research shows the business advantage of reasonable hours, some employers will come to question the wisdom of grueling schedules. If and when those forces gain traction, neither women nor men will feel the need to sacrifice the home or the work domain, demand for change will swell, and women may begin to achieve workplace equality with men."

Emotional exhaustion lies at the heart of burnout. As your emotional resources are used up in trying to cope with challenging situations — such as overwhelming demands, conflict, or lack of support at work or at home — your sense of well-being and capacity to care for yourself and others is diminished. In fact, research shows that people suffering from emotional exhaustion experience higher levels of work-life conflict. They may find that they have less patience to engage with family and friends at the end of the day and become frustrated with them more easily — a problem that is exacerbated by the current Covid-19 crisis, not only for those toiling away on the front lines but also working from home, while balancing personal responsibilities with no outside help. This can lead us to feelings of guilt and loss. Take my coaching client, Evelyn. A product manager in a medical device firm that’s recently been acquired, she was already struggling with a high level of uncertainty at work prior to the pandemic. While she feels lucky to be financially stable for the time being, work remains an emotional struggle. Since the acquisition, she hasn’t been getting reliable information from senior leadership and doesn’t know whom to trust. Consequently, she can’t provide clarity to her worried, and now remote, team, which makes her feel like an unreliable leader. She is disappointed at her boss’s failure to advocate for the division and to demand greater clarity from the executives of the acquiring company. What’s worse, the very qualities of the business that gave Evelyn a sense of purpose are being extinguished, leading her to question how long she can continue working there. The unsettling prospect of having to leave a job she once loved to protect her happiness is heightened by her status as the primary earner in her family and the contracting job market. The weight of these circumstances has left Evelyn emotionally exhausted. Evelyn’s husband Jack is a writer who’s been working from home since before their three-year-old son, Ben, and seven-year-old daughter, Judith, were born. Prior to the lockdown, Jack took care of the children while Evelyn was at the office. Now that they’re all home together, the boundaries between her personal and professional lives have collapsed and she worries that she’s performing poorly in both areas. She’s annoyed when her children interrupt her work calls and disappointed with herself for feeling that way. At the same time, her mind churns with anxiety about her job. She feels unable to shake her growing sense of dread and feels like a less joyful person than she used to be. On her worst days, she barely recognizes herself. Evelyn’s situation is not unique. Many of my coaching clients are also emotionally drained by aspects of their jobs, from an overwhelming workload to interpersonal conflict, having to compromise one’s values to being ostracized, mistreated, or harassed. During the pandemic, grief over the loss of normalcy, concerns about health and financial security, and the challenges of navigating confinement and isolation ─ or the lack of ability to find quiet time alone ─ are additional factors that can exacerbate stress. Pushing back against emotional exhaustion requires a combination of three approaches: reducing the drain on your emotional resources, learning to conserve them, and regularly replenishing them. Imagine that you have an internal fuel tank and a gauge on your dashboard that lets you know how full it is. Some conditions cause your fuel to burn up quickly, just as extreme weather, rough terrain, carrying a heavy load, or accelerating and braking rapidly would use gas at a greater rate than normal on-the-road scenarios. To make sure you don’t run low on fuel, you want to reduce your exposure to difficult conditions, drive more efficiently, and make sure you refuel regularly. The first step in reducing emotional resource consumption is recognizing the circumstances (e.g., situations, tasks, relationships) that deplete you, then limiting your exposure to them. Turning back to the case of Evelyn, there is not much she can do to change or avoid the shifting cultural dynamics at work in the wake of the acquisition or the additional stressors created by the pandemic and recession. But she has realized that engaging in doomsday conversations with a particularly negative colleague heightens her anxiety, so Evelyn is no longer indulging in these exchanges. When her coworker starts complaining, Evelyn reminds her that, while they’re not happy about the direction the company appears to be moving in, they’ll both feel and perform better if they focus on what they can control, such as how they show up and relate to other people. Then she engages her counterpart in a conversation about what’s going well. Evelyn has also asked her boss to share any information he receives from senior leadership even if it’s incomplete. She has made it clear that she is better able to manage her team when she has a clearer view into what’s happening at the top of the organization. The next step is learning to operate with greater emotional efficiency with emotion regulation techniques, such as recognizing and acknowledging your feelings and reappraising stressful experiences. Evelyn uses two strategies to reframe what she experiences and how she thinks about it to conserve her emotional resources. The first is stepping outside of her own perspective and considering the larger context of her situation. She reminds herself that some of the disruption she’s facing, although unpleasant, is normal in the context of mergers and acquisitions, and that those related to the pandemic have become a universal experience. When she remembers that she is one of many people going through such turmoil, it feels less personal. The second strategy is staying connected to her core values and using them to navigate difficult situations. Evelyn cares deeply about being honest and reliable. In coaching, we helped her find tangible anchors for these values by reflecting on what comes to mind when she thinks about the words honesty and reliability. She settled on an antique clock on her shelf — a gift from her beloved father — that still keeps perfect time. For her, it represents honesty and reliability. Whenever she looks at the clock, she renews her connection to these values and feels more capable of showing up as a positive and supportive leader her team can rely on. The other critical strategy for preventing emotional exhaustion is making sure that you refuel. To overcome her fears about potentially having to find a new job, Evelyn is reaching out and renewing connections with people in her network. Through these conversations, she feels a stronger sense of belonging to her professional community, gathers valuable information about options available to her, and feels validated as a person who has much to offer. As a result, she feels much more hopeful. While she’s not actively looking for another job at this time, she’ll be better positioned if she does decide to. Another way to boost reserves is to engage in nonwork activities ─ like going for walks, connecting with friends over Zoom, or pursuing hobbies like cooking or gardening. Doing so promotes relaxation, psychological detachment from work, and feelings of control and mastery. One insidious effect of emotional exhaustion is, when you’re suffering from it, you may feel too tired to marshal the effort needed for exercise, social interaction, or hobbies. But you must. Evelyn and her family came up with a creative ritual for joyfully reconnecting with one another. At six o’clock every evening, Jack puts on dance music and everyone dances together in the living room for 15 minutes. The kids look forward to it, the adults let go of the day’s stresses, and they all laugh, smile, and enjoy being silly together. Mindfulness practices, such as paying attention to your experiences from moment-to-moment, focusing on your breathing, spending 10 minutes thinking about what you’re grateful for, or intentionally looking for what’s positive, are yet another way to refuel. Research shows that people who do this at work experience lower levels of emotional exhaustion. Adopting the above practices doesn’t mean you won’t experience moments of stress and anxiety. But they will increase your resilience and resistance to emotional exhaustion. If our content helps you to contend with coronavirus and other challenges, please consider subscribing to HBR.

You could be sitting at your desk but more preoccupied about a home repair than the assignment at hand, or you could be at the kitchen table thinking more about the proposal you have to finish than the people eating dinner with you. That’s why transitions from work mode to personal mode are so essential. Whether you’re heading into the office or working from home, here are some tips for making the shift between work and personal time. First, have a starting work routine. Set up habits that tell yourself it’s time to start work. Then, make a plan for meetings, the projects you work work on, and when. Prioritize your communication to limit distractions whether you’re on work or personal time. Finally, set a wrap-up routine, so you end your workday and can be fully off-the-clock later.

Physical presence doesn’t always equate to mental presence. You could be sitting at your desk but more preoccupied about a home repair than the assignment at hand, or you could be at the kitchen table thinking more about the proposal you have to finish than the people eating dinner with you. That’s why transitions from work mode to personal mode are so essential. And you have to make an especially intentional effort on these transitions when you work from home because you don’t have the natural change of context cues. In my experience as a time management coach, here are some of the ways to be less distracted and more present whether you’re working or enjoying personal time. Mr. Rogers knew how to do transitions right. Many generations of children knew that when he was singing his iconic “It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” changing his sweater, and then putting on different shoes that it was the start of their time together. You don’t need to sing when you start work (unless you really want to), and you don’t need to switch sweaters. But you can have certain things that you do in the same way each morning — even if you work from home. Maybe it’s putting your dishes in the dishwasher, turning off the lights that may be on around the house, getting a cup of coffee, and then sitting down at your computer. Or maybe it’s doing a quick workout, showering, and then turning to your phone to check email. Whatever works for you, try to do those activities in the same way each day. The point behind this is to prime your brain that this is now “work” time. To increase your productivity and clarity both for work and life outside of work, have a plan for the day. That includes knowing the time of your meetings, deciding what projects you will work on, and being clear on when you will do tasks like answering email. You’ll also want to have some plan for your evenings in terms of what you would like to get done or simply do to relax. Knowing that everything has a “place,” such as a time during your work day when you will work on a presentation or a time in the evening when you can research activities for your kids, helps you to not feel like you have to do work during personal time or vice versa. The most common times people make these daily plans are in the morning at the start of work, as they wrap up their work days, or in the evening before bed. Choose the time that’s best for you, and then put a recurring reminder in your calendar to prompt you to build the habit. It’s understandable that you may need to have some personal communication during work hours and some professional communication after hours. But prioritize your communication based on context. During the hours when you want to focus on the job, try to reduce your personal communication. For example, you could group together answering nonurgent personal texts to a few times during your work day and, in general, avoid long stretches on social media. After those hours, do the opposite. Stay away from work email and only answer work calls and texts in the evening if they are absolutely necessary. This will not only keep your time invested in the right places but also keep you mentally present in both your professional life and personal life. To make sure you can be fully off-the-clock later in the evening, have a wrap-up routine that you start at least 30 minutes before you need to end work. This could include doing a final check to make sure that all critical emails have a response, looking over your task list to know that you have completed what’s essential, and if you do realize that you will need to work later at night, decide on exactly what you will complete and when. For example, you might determine, “I will review this proposal for an hour or less starting at 8 PM.” The reason it’s good to have that specificity is then you won’t have a cloud over your head all evening that you should probably do some work without a clear sense of exactly what you will do and when. You can mentally disconnect until 8 PM and then also feel free to completely stop at 9 PM. when the objective and the time frame are clear. Focus takes intentional effort and can feel difficult at times, especially in the midst of massive uncertainty. But by following these tips, it is possible to be present most of the time when you’re working or in your personal time.

"191",191,"https://hbr.org/2020/05/how-to-cope-with-that-always-on-feeling","work life.txt","Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the negative effects of an “always-on” lifestyle were becoming apparent. Now that constant connectivity is our new normal, it is even more important that we learn to set clear boundaries for ourselves, in order to sustain our productivity and our families’ well-being. Research has found three steps to help protect yourself: 1) Build your willpower; 2) Set boundaries — and stick to them; and 3) Communicate directly and deliberately. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. Tools allowing for instant communication have given us the ability to work from anywhere. With employees being only an email or Slack message away, organizations are now omnipresent in the lives of employees. And now, with many working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic, managers and coworkers who were once in the office down the hall, are now in your living room, kitchen, or bedroom (wherever you can find a quiet place to plug in your laptop). This has opened a door into our personal lives that can be quite difficult to close. The negative effects of this “always-on” lifestyle were becoming apparent even before the pandemic, with research demonstrating that spousal resentment and work-family conflict increased the more often employees checked smart devices during family time. Now that constant connectivity is our new normal, it is even more important that we learn to set clear boundaries for ourselves, in order to sustain our productivity and our families’ well-being. So, what are we to do? While we’re all experiencing greater job and family stress in this new normal, our recent research has found there are steps that employees can take to protect their well-being. Employees with a strong ability to self-regulate can mitigate the stress of constant connectivity. Also known as “willpower,” self-regulation represents our ability to resist temptation. Anyone who has been expecting an update on Slack while eating dinner with the family knows that the “need” to check for that update is a very real temptation. The good news is that self-regulation is a muscle that gets stronger the more you use it. In other words, no one is cursed to live a life without willpower — it can be improved. Even better, self-regulation is universal; the willpower used to resist that second piece of cheesecake is the same willpower that can keep you from checking your phone for the 14th time this hour. To improve your willpower, we recommend starting with the basics. With your new work environment being the home, it is easy to grow lax when it comes to daily chores and following basic routines. Not making the bed anymore? Make your bed. Instead of slouching at your desk chair — sit up straight. Diet gone out the window after your third week in quarantine? Get back on the healthy eating wagon. All of these little, minor disciplines are small workouts that strengthen your overall willpower and will ultimately help you in separating your work life from your home life. Of course, there will come a time when your willpower runs out. Current research suggests willpower is slowly depleted throughout the day as we resist temptations and only recharges once we go to sleep. In other words, our ability to self-regulate continually decreases throughout the day and leaves us at our weakest point in the evening. Temptations like that one extra slice of cheesecake or answering just “a few” more emails are nearly irresistible at night simply because we no longer possess the willpower necessary to resist. In our new normal, especially for parents who attempt to work after their children go to bed, this is a perfect storm of weakness that makes evening work sessions so unproductive. Our recommendations for combatting this lack of willpower are twofold. First, don’t give your willpower a chance to falter. Set a hard cut-off for checking your messages from work and then physically enforce it — close Slack, log out of Teams, turn off your phone. At a minimum, turn off all notifications so that you don’t hear or see the “incoming” message alert. Remember, if you don’t have cheesecake in your refrigerator, you can’t eat it — similarly, if you can’t see the messages, you can’t check them. Note that this may mean you need to “manage your boss” to set realistic expectations as to how quickly you will be able to respond after certain hours. Second, as the pandemic continues to wear on, some people may begin to feel like they are struggling with a lack of willpower and an absence of motivation. This is a vicious cycle because willpower requires motivation. This makes intuitive sense; there is no reason to self-regulate your behavior if you have no motivation to do so. Thus, if you are feeling unmotivated right now, it is going to be incredibly difficult to self-regulate. No one is going to fault you for failing to stay motivated during this pandemic, especially when the vast majority of us have been labeled “unessential.” However, this is the time to take a moment and reflect on why your job is “essential” to you, to your clients, and to the greater community. Try not to forget that all of us are contributing to something bigger than ourselves. In a time of social distancing, when we live in our own echo chambers, it is not surprising that many of us crave being able to bounce our ideas off of others. We no longer have the opportunity to run into someone in the hall or break room. In lieu of walking over to a colleague’s desk, we send a Slack message and hope they are available (e.g., not chasing a toddler around their house). The result of this asynchronous communication is that every time we return to our computers or phones, we have numerous unread messages — many time-sensitive — waiting for us. What would have been a quick stop by a friend’s office now becomes a series of 10 or more messages exchanged over the course of a day or two — all of which both you and your colleague feel require immediate responses. Worse, what if the colleague you are asking for a second opinion is already swamped with work? In the past, you may have sought out that colleague at work and found them at their desk, head in hand, and decided to walk away so as not to burden them with another problem. Now more than ever, as we work in an office-less environment, it is imperative that we try to communicate deliberately and not in a haphazard fashion. Send the messages that need to be sent and try to limit those that are unnecessary. Leaders have a special responsibility to set an example and act deliberately. Sending emails and messages at all hours of the day and night will set an expectation that employees need to do the same. Instead of spending time with their family in the evening, employees will have one eye on their phone awaiting that inevitable next message. A more effective approach is to actively choose what to request of your employees and work with them to determine a realistic timeline for that task’s completion. This aids in establishing standards of “how” work will be done, not just “what” work will be done. Setting such expectations acknowledges the stresses employees are experiencing and likely will result in reduced stress and higher quality job performance. As we reflect on the Covid-19 pandemic response to date, an unprecedented level of digital connectedness for both employees and leaders has emerged. As social distancing continues and we adjust to these new work demands, it is critical that employees retain (or regain) some level of control over their work. If employees work to improve their willpower and set appropriate work-to-life boundaries, and if leaders communicate standards and expectations effectively, working from home during this pandemic can be a universal positive for everyone lucky enough to be able to do it.

This was an always unrealistic archetype, and the Covid-19 crisis has shown just how unrealistic it is. The authors explain how shifting away from this harmful model will benefit not only working parents but all employees — and lead to better performing organizations. In these difficult times, we’ve made a number of our coronavirus articles free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter. As if being a working parent didn’t already include enough moving pieces to manage, even toddlers are now having standing teleconferences. For the two of us, our daughters’ virtual morning preschool meeting is one more item to be juggled as we attempt to work full-time from home without childcare. Our own conference calls are scheduled for naptime and occasionally interrupted by a request for potty. We attempt to wedge the rest of the workday into the early mornings and post-bedtime. The Covid-19 crisis has shoved work and home lives under the same roof for many families like ours, and the struggle to manage it all is now visible to peers and bosses. As people postulate how the country may be forever changed by the pandemic, we can hope that one major shift will be a move away from the harmful assumption that a 24/7 work culture is working well for anyone. For decades, scholars have described how organizations were built upon the implicit model of an “ideal worker”: one who is wholly devoted to their job and is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, every year of their career. This was always an unrealistic archetype, one that presumed a full-time caretaker in the background. Yet today, over two-thirds of American families are headed by single parents or two working parents. With schools and daycares closed, work cannot continue as normal simply because working remotely is technologically possible. Employees are disproportionally well-compensated for being ideal workers. “Time greedy” professions like finance, consulting, and law — where 80- or 100-hour weeks may be typical — compensate their workers per hour more than professions with a regular 40-hour week. Flexible-work arrangements come with severe penalties; many who leave the workforce for a period or shift to part-time never recover their professional standing or compensation. When individuals push back — asking for less travel or requesting part-time or flexible hours — their performance reviews suffer and they are less likely to be promoted, studies find. Simply asking for workplace flexibility engenders professional stigma. The “ideal worker” expectation is particularly punitive for working mothers, who also typically put in more hours of caregiving work at home than their spouses. Furthermore, men are more likely to “fake it” and pass as ideal workers, while women make clear that they cannot meet these expectations, including by negotiating flexible-work arrangements. Many organizations are not amenable to adjustments, leading to the perception that women are opting out of the workforce — although research suggests women are actually “pushed out.” In our world of laptops, cellphones, and teleconferences, the intellectual and analytical tasks of “knowledge workers” can continue at home. But low-wage workers increasingly are subject to similar expectations of responsiveness, even as they have less job security and even less flexibility than higher paid workers. In the midst of this pandemic, store clerks, delivery drivers, and warehouse workers are now forced to be “ideal workers” too, risking exposure to the virus in public with little support for the families they leave to go to work. There have been many calls for restructuring how work is done, including making more room for our families and questioning the real value of the eight-hour (or more) workday. Now is a time for companies to step back and reexamine which traditional ways of working exist because of convention, not necessity. Executives and managers have the opportunity to choose quality work over quantity of work. They can value the creative ideas that emerge after a midday hike or meditation session, rather than putting in face time at the office. They can stop rewarding the faster response over the better response, or the longer workday over a more productive workday. They can rethink highly competitive career tracks where you make it or wash out — such as giving tenure-track scholars and partner-track lawyers the choice of a longer clock before their evaluation. During this pandemic, employers are seeing that workers can’t function well without accommodation for their family responsibilities. Will that lesson last after the crisis is over? American families want greater choices in determining how their work and their families fit together. Post-pandemic, can we create a system that fits real workers, not just idealized ones? If so, we have the opportunity to emerge from this crisis with both healthier employees and better performing organizations.

Amir and Ria are working professionals living in Seattle: he works at Amazon and she’s the CEO of an early-stage start-up. They have two kids, Amara and Aryan, who are 6 and 2 years old. They’re used to managing the usual challenges of dual working parents — coordinating childcare with schools and activities, managing meals and household chores, and spending quality time together on the weekends. Things all became more complicated with the outbreak of the coronavirus in Seattle and its suburbs a couple of weeks ago. First Amazon asked all employees to start working from home, and then a week later Amara’s school announced they would be closing for four weeks, with potential for more. Ria’s office and Aryan’s daycare closed soon after. Since then, Amir and Ria have been trying to juggle full-time childcare for both kids and working from home while trying to preserve as much productivity as possible. For the first week, they approached the situation like a vacation, with little structure around schedule or duties. This quickly turned into a frustrating situation for everyone. They weren’t getting work done, they were worried about how much they were relying on a tablet to keep Amara entertained, and regular things like meals and cleaning seemed to be just piling up. That they were all stuck together in a closed space just made it all worse. As a company building software to help working parents collaboratively run their families, we routinely gather the best practices of busy parents and in the past days have been polling families in Seattle, San Francisco, and New York City that have already been experiencing this new normal. Their experiences have taught us that the key is to invent new ways to preserve old routines. Maintaining a sense of familiarity and consistency is both comforting and therapeutic in times of upheaval — but it’s also practical. When you’re going to be fighting for every inch of productivity, you want each day to feel like an established habit, no wasted time on wondering what’s for lunch or when we’re going outside to play. Here are three steps to bring your old plan into your new normal: The first step is to keep the structure of the day the same as it has typically been. Beyond the benefits of familiarity, maintaining a regular schedule will give you firm guideposts for building your work and childcare schedules. For one family we work with, their daily routine used to include breakfast at 8:15am for the kids and then a day of activities with the nanny once the parents left for work: an hour of free-play time, an outdoor adventure, lunch at home, and then a mix of educational and craft activities before one more outdoor time. They ate dinner at 5pm before the parents came home at 6pm. In the evening they read books and played before bedtime at 7:30 or 8pm. I’d advise this family to keep their routine. Whether or not they still have the nanny, they should try to keep the meals, blocks of activity, and outdoor time. (I’ve personally used this approach when traveling with the family for extended periods.) You’ll be creating the actual schedules in the next step but the key first is identifying the foundation based on what you already know. Next, build a schedule for each week that incorporates these routines at a high level but is modified to account for your work blocks and other new responsibilities meals, chores, childcare. We’ve modified the “Sunday Check-in” planning rundown we created for busy working parents specifically in these chaotic times when planning out the week is even more important. In your planning make sure you’ve covered: Take this info and put it into a calendar and start assigning shifts and duties to specific family members. Our family has a Google Calendar and we’ve created a simple example for families to use to create their kids’ schedules and add shifts on top. Finally, create work blocks. Depending on your childcare, community, and quarantine situation, here are three ways to make this work: A partner swap: 4-hour shifts in which one partner works and the other cares for kids. Short shifts: 30-minute to 2-hour shifts that rotate among some number of adults. Video shifts: While you’ll still need to be paying some attention, it’s possible, especially with older kids, to organize virtual playdates (more on this below) or calls with grandparents that will keep them entertained while you’re getting in a phone call or doing some heads-down work. It will feel like you need to squeeze every ounce of productivity out of every minute in the day. It’s a reality that many of us will have to find time to work early in the morning or after the kids are in bed. But be sure to schedule in breaks and unstructured times to unwind and connect with your partner and kids. This is going to be a marathon and it’s important we find ways not to burn out. Finally, if your kids are used to having playdates or weekly activities, find ways to keep those events on the calendar, just in a new form. Everyone will appreciate the social time and, as a bonus, it also can buy you 30 minutes of uninterrupted work time. Some options to consider: Virtual playdates: Choose Google Hangouts (or Zoom if you prefer) and then send invites to your kids’ friends’ parents. For the playdate itself, have a station set up in your house with a tablet, laptop, or Alexa Show/Facebook Portal ready to go. During the playdate, it can be as simple as the kids catching up and coloring together or one of the parents leading an activity or reading books. Creative athletic activities for the kids. Register your kids for free online classes like Cosmic Yoga, Art Hub for Kids, or Go Noodle. Schedule these during the times they might otherwise be doing after-school activities. They should get some exercise every day — this could even be just going into the backyard and do some soccer drills or play catch. Parent pods: Find a group of 3-4 other families you’re close with and create a shared pool of resources, whether it’s meal plans, activity schedules, or lesson plans. Book club or sports viewing nights for you. Staying social, active, and connected is just as important for the adults. If you don’t already have one, create a book club or a sport/TV show viewing club. Get it into people’s calendars and set up a video call so everyone can watch together. Make sure to still get your workouts in with a run outside, an indoor circuit, or using  online options. Even a family walk around the block will do wonders. We need to lean on our village now, more than ever. The nature of this crisis requires that we find safe and responsible ways to help each other out while upholding our responsibilities at work and at home. Lean on your village — the other parents in your community — to share responsibility, looking out especially for those that might need extra help, such as healthcare or hourly workers left without childcare. Accept that things are not going to run completely smoothly and we aren’t going to all be our 100% productive selves. But with tempered expectations, a flexible approach and resourcefulness, you’ll be amazed at how we can all adapt. With any luck, we’ll emerge from this crisis even stronger and more collaborative: a modern take on an age-old approach to parenting.
